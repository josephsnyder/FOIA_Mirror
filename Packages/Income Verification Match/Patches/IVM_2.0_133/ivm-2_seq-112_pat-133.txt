Associated patches: (v)IVM*2*126   <<= must be installed BEFORE `IVM*2*133'

Subject: FIX ADDRESS CHANGE USER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When a demographic change occurs, the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) 
 transmits an unsolicited (ORU-Z05) demographic update to VistA.  If the 
 veteran has active medication on file at the VistA site, the change is 
 not automatically uploaded at the site.  Instead, the changes go into the 
 Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] option for manual review and 
 processing.  (Please note the Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] option 
 requires the IVM UPLOAD security key.)  At that time, a user performing 
 the review can either choose to upload or delete the changes.  IF neither 
 action is taken at the end of 14 days, the IVM BACKGROUND JOB will 
 process the change.  If at that time, based on the business rules in 
 place, the changes should be uploaded, the software will stuff "IVM AUTO 
 ADDR JOB" as the user making the change.  This is inconsistent with the 
 data dictionary, as no such user exists in the NEW PERSON (#200) file for 
 "IVM AUTO ADDR JOB".
  
 This patch, IVM*2.0*133, will update the IVM BACKGROUND JOB to correctly 
 stuff "POSTMASTER" as the user making the change for future incoming 
 Z05s. 
  
 Post-Installation Overview:
 ==========================
 This patch contains a post installation which will perform a cleanup of 
 all existing entries in the ADDRESS CHANGE USER (#.122) field of the 
 PATIENT (#2) file where the field value contains the text string "IVM 
 AUTO ADDR JOB".  The post installation will also clean up the ADDRESS 
 CHANGE USER (#2) and the PRIOR ADDRESS CHANGE USER (#5) fields of the IVM 
 ADDRESS CHANGE LOG (#301.7) file that contain the string "IVM AUTO ADDR 
 JOB".  The fields listed for each files are pointer fields to the NEW 
 PERSON (#200) file and in each instance will be pointed to the POSTMASTER 
 (DUZ=.5) entry.  Once the post-installation is complete, two bulletins 
 will be generated to the person installing the patch.  Samples of those 
 bulletins are located below:

 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000237806 - ADDRESS CHANGE USER data conflicts with DD
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000237806 - ADDRESS CHANGE USER data conflicts with DD
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Hundreds of entries in the PATIENT file #2 and the IVM ADDRESS CHANGE LOG 
 file #301.7 have "IVM AUTO ADDR JOB" as the user making the change.  This 
 is incorrect.  Instead, it should be "POSTMASTER".
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The IVM BACKGROUND JOB will be updated to correctly stuff "POSTMASTER" as 
 the user making the change for future incoming Z05s.  Additionally, a 
 cleanup will also be performed to change all existing entries in the 
 PATIENT file #2 and the IVM ADDRESS CHANGE LOG file #301.7 from "IVM AUTO 
 ADDR JOB" to "POSTMASTER".
  
 Test Sites:
