Subject: Fix MST Status Determination

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch, IVM*2.0*128, corrects a problem with the HL7 Z07 consistency 
 checker.  When retrieving the last and most current Military Sexual 
 Trauma (MST) determination, there is a programming bug that causes the 
 consistency checker to always incorrectly retrieve the first MST 
 determination.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000225361 - MST STATUS SITE INVALID
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000225361 - MST STATUS SITE INVALID
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An "MST STATUS SITE INVALID" inconsistency message is logged to the 
 INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS REP option for certain veterans, when Z07 
 transmissions are sent.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 There is a programming bug in the Z07 consistency checker.  Because of 
 this bug, rather than retrieving the last and most current MST 
 determination, the consistency checker is always retrieving the first MST 
 determination.  Because MST determinations are stored for historical 
 purposes, sometimes, the preceding MST determinations are made by sites 
 that are no longer active facilities.  This causes the record to fail the 
 Z07 inconsistency check.  Routine IVMZ07C will be updated to correctly 
 retrieve the last MST data.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
