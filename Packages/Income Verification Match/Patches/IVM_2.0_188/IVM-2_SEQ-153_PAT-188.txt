Description:
============

 Patch IVM*2.0*188 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 Patch IVM*2.0*188 is also being released in support of the Enrollment
 System (ES) 5.9 release. Refer to Informational Patch Enrollment 
 Application System EAS*1*183 for additional details regarding the ES
 release. 
  
 NOTE: IVM*2.0*188 is being released with DG*5.3*985 in Host File    
       DG_53_P985.KID.
  
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Registration, Eligibility, & Enrollment (REE) EMERGENCY
 CONTACT DATA, SCREEN <3> screen currently shows the Emergency Contact 
 Contact data from the PATIENT (#2) file in the following 5 groups:
  - Primary Emergency Contact
  - Secondary Emergency Contact
  - Primary Next of Kin
  - Secondary Next of Kin
  - Designee
  
 VistA REE receives Emergency Contact details via Health Level 7 (HL7)
 HL7 messaging from ES. The current functionality is to use this data 
 in VistA REE and Income verification Match (IVM) packages to add and 
 modify Emergency Contact details in the PATIENT (#2) file only if the
 incoming Emergency Contact data is newer than the existing data in VistA.
  
 This patch will modify VistA HL7 messaging and add the ability to delete
 Emergency Contact details in the PATIENT (#2) file.
  
 The following menu options allow a VistA REE user to view, add, or
 update the Emergency Contact Data: 
        Load/Edit Patient Data   [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
        Patient Inquiry          [DG PATIENT INQUIRY]
        Preregister a Patient    [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
        Eligibility Verification [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION]
        View Registration Data   [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
        Register a Patient       [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
        Admit a Patient          [DG ADMIT PATIENT]
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
 This patch makes the following enhancements to VistA REE:
     
 With installation of this patch, VistA receives and deletes Emergency
 Contact data in the PATIENT (#2) file if double quotes are received in
 the ZCT segment of the ORU-Z05 HL7 message sent by ES and the
 date/timestamp received in the ZCT segment is newer than the existing  
 date/timestamp stored in VistA.
    - Emergency Contact changes are received from ES via ORU-Z05 HL7
      messages, which now include double quotes in the ZCT segment to
      delete Emergency Contact data in the PATIENT (#2) file.
    - VistA now accepts and processes ES deletion of the fields on the
      EMERGENCY CONTACT DATA, SCREEN <3> screen received via the 
      ORU-Z05 HL7 message.
