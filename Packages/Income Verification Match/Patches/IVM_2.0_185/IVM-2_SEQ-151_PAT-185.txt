 1. INC6706690 - SOURCE OF INCOME TEST file (#408.34) is not in sync with
                 the SDSADM.STD_INCOMETESTSOURCE table
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During investigation of a means test issue it was discovered that the
 SOURCE OF INCOME TEST (#408.34) file is not in sync with the
 SDSADM.STD_INCOMETESTSOURCE table in SDS. The HEC-old (5) and VOA (6)
 entries in the SDS table are not filing properly due to hanging pointers 
 when some data is being filed in VistA.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Entries 5 and 6 from the SDSADM.STD_INCOMETESTSOURCE table in SDS will be
 added to the SOURCE OF INCOME TEST (#408.34) file in VistA.
  
 These new entries are described below:
  
 NUMBER: 5                               NAME: HEC-old
   TEST IS EDITABLE?: NO
  DESCRIPTION:   Income tests from HEC-old are those that were conducted by
  the Heath Eligibility Center prior to the Data Collection Division of the
  IVM Center.  These tests are electronically transmitted to the site and
  automatically uploaded upon receipt.  They are not editable by the site.
  
  
 NUMBER: 6                               NAME: VOA
   TEST IS EDITABLE?: NO
  DESCRIPTION:   Income tests from VOA are those that were conducted by the
  ESR 3.1/Veterans' Online Application Data Collection Division of the IVM
  Center. These tests are electronically transmitted to the site and
  automatically uploaded upon receipt.  They are not editable by the site.
