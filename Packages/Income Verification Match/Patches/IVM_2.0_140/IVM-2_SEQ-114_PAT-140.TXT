Subject: DISABLE BULLETINS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch disables the following bulletins from being generated when VistA
 receives an update from the ESR system via HL7 messaging.
  
 HEC INCOME TEST UPLOAD
 IVM-DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000312631 - 1 pt record per message IVM messages (ESR2)
 HD0000000315896 - Remove the three Bulletins, reference ticket #313065
  
   Problem:   Prior to ESR becoming the system of record (SOR) the following
              bulletins were sent for a batch of patients.  Since ESR sends
              updates on a single patient basis instead of batched, the number
              of bulletins generated have increased significantly.
  
              HEC INCOME TEST UPLOAD
              IVM-DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD
  
  
   Solution:  The bulletins will no longer be generated when VistA receives
              updates from the ESR system.
