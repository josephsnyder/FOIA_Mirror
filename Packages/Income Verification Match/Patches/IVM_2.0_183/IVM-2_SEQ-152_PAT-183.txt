Description:
============

 Patch IVM*2.0*183 is being released to support the enhancements for the 
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on 
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 IVM*2.0*183 is being released with DG*5.3*972 in Host File 
 DG_53_P972.KID.
  
 Patch IVM*2.0*183 is also being released in support of the Enrollment 
 System (ES) 5.5 and 5.7 releases. Refer to Informational Patches
 EAS*1*173 and EAS*1*180 (Enrollment Application System) for additional
 detail regarding the ES releases.
  
 IMPORTANT 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following patches are being released concurrently and should be 
 installed in the following order:
  
 1. Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture 
    (VistA) Registration, Eligibility, & Enrollment (REE) Registration (DG)
    patch DG*5.3*972, released with Income Verification Match (IVM) patch
    IVM*2.0*183 in Host File DG_53_P972.KID, ensures Veterans awarded 
    Medal of Honor are placed in Priority Group 1 and are exempt from
    copayments for health care and medications.
  
 2. Patch IVM*2.0*183, released with DG*5.3*972 in Host File 
    DG_53_P972.KID, modifies how VistA determines if an income test is the
    active current test per Veteran's Financial Assessment (VFA) rules and
    adds a condition that Medal of Honor recipients are not subject to  
    income testing.
  
 3. Patch EAS*1.0*174 ensures VistA users can exempt Veterans awarded 
    Medal of Honor from Long Term Care (LTC) copayments and LTC income
    testing.
  
 4. Integrated Billing (IB) patch IB*2.0*627 will need to be installed
    directly after EAS*1.0*174 as the full functionality of Medal of Honor
    will not be apparent until IB*2.0*627 is installed.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 When a site receives an income test update from the Health Eligibility 
 Center (HEC) (Health Level 7 (HL7) ORU/ORF-Z10 message type), a number of 
 checks are completed on the incoming data before allowing that 
 information to update the site's database. One of the checks is to 
 determine whether the test is a current income test. If an incoming test 
 date is more than 365 days old, the system rejects and does not upload 
 the test if the status is Means Test (MT) Copay Exempt (MT COPAY EXEMPT)
 or Geographic Means Test (GMT) Copay Required (GMT COPAY REQUIRED).
  
 IVM*2.0*183 modifies how VistA determines if an income test is the active
 current test per Veteran's Financial Assessment (VFA) rules. Subject to
 existing criteria, it will also consider the following as current income
 tests and upload the MT: The received income test has an MT Date greater
 than or equal to one year prior to the VFA Start Date (VFA Start Date =
 1/1/2013), and the MT status is either MT COPAY EXEMPT or GMT COPAY
 REQUIRED. Note: Rules that determine whether the site has a more current
 income test and whether the test is active or inactive have not been
 modified, and may result in rejection of the income test. For example, if
 there is a 2017 income test on file at the site, and a 2015 income test is
 received from ES, the incoming test is not a current test, so it will be
 rejected and will not upload. 
  
 VistA users can view the accepted MT in the View a Past Means Test [DG 
 MEANS TEST VIEW TEST] option. Because the test has been accepted, the 
 user will not see messages such as "MEANS TEST REQUIRED" in these 
 scenarios.
  
 An MT will be accepted from the ES when an HL7 ORU/ORF-Z10 message 
 is received at correlated sites using VFA rules to determine if the MT is 
 a current active test. The following criteria are added to that
 determination:
  
      a. The MT Date is greater than or equal to one year prior to the VFA
         Start Date, the patient is subject to Means Testing, and the 
         patient's MT status is MT COPAY EXEMPT.
  
         OR
  
      b. The MT Date is greater than or equal to one year prior to the VFA
         Start Date, the patient is subject to Means Testing, the 
         patient's MT status is GMT COPAY REQUIRED, and the patient has
         agreed to pay the deductible(s).
  
 When ES sends an HL7 ORU/ORF-Z10 message containing the ZMT segment to 
 VistA sites where the Veteran is known, the system will accept and 
 process the income test when the above conditions exist. Previously 
 rejected Z10 messages can also be resent and processed per the above 
 criteria.
  
 Integration Control Registration (ICR) 7088 ($$OLDMTPF^DGMTU4(TESTDATE))
 is added to determine if annual means test date is more than 1 year old.

 An MT received from ES in an HL7 ORU/ORF-Z10 message may not be 
 appropriate for certain patients and may be rejected. Some examples of 
 inappropriate MTs are those for Veterans who are deceased, or those not 
 subject to income testing such as Purple Heart recipients and the 
 catastrophically disabled. Patch IVM*2.0*183 adds a further condition:  
 Medal of Honor recipients. In these cases, the MT is rejected and VistA 
 returns the message "Means Test upload not appropriate for current 
 patient".
  
 Note: Registration patch DG*5.3*972 used the existing structure of the 
 HL7 VA-Specific Military History Segment (ZMH) in VistA to send three new
 Medal of Honor (MOH) data elements. These updates allow filing of MOH data
 when sent by ES. The ZMH tables in the IVM Technical Manual are updated to
 include MOH data elements (CURRENT MOH INDICATOR (#.541), MOH AWARD DATE
 (#.542), and MOH STATUS DATE (#.543) in the PATIENT file (#2)) in the
 existing fields.
