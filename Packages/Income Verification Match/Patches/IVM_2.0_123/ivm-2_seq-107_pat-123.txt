Subject: MEANS TEST FOR PRIOR YEAR NOT UPLOADING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses an issue concerning the inability of sites to upload 
 certain means tests. All the Remedy tickets referenced below describe
 the same issue and have the same solution.
  
  Issue:
   If the following conditions are true:
     1.  A patient has no means test on file for an income year, but has
         an IVM converted test on file as the last test found in a previous
         year 
       AND
     2.  A VAMC test from another site is received for a more current year
  
   Then the following occurs on VistA:      
     1.  The newer means test is ignored (because the system erroneously
         judges the newer test to be a duplicate of the earlier, IVM
         converted test)
       AND
     2.  No HL7 message is sent back to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC)
         to document its rejection.
  
  Resolution:
   When a new means test arrives, the software will determine if it is a 
   duplicate of an existing IVM converted means test for the patient by 
   checking whether the tests' income years are the same.  If they are, an
   'AE' error message will be sent via HL7 to the HEC to record a means
   test was received that could not be uploaded due to an IVM test already
   on file for that year.  If the existing test is not associated with the
   same income year as the new test being added, the new test will not be
   considered a duplicate and will be allowed to load into the veteran's
   record.
