Subject: REMOVE FIELD CHECK FOR Z07 INCONSISTENCIES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem with the Z07 Build Consistency Check [DG Z07 
 CONSISTENCY CHECK] option whereby inconsistencies that have been 
 resolved are potentially not being removed from the INCONSISTENT DATA 
 file (#38.5).  The option calls a line of code (DELETE^IVMZ07C) which 
 currently uses the CHECK/DON'T CHECK field (#5) in conjunction with the 
 USE FOR Z07 CHECK field (#6) to determine whether or not a particular 
 inconsistency should be deleted.  VHA Directive 2008-031, VETERANS 
 HEALTH INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE (VISTA) CONSISTENCY 
 CHECKS, dated June 10, 2008, directed sites to change the value of the 
 CHECK/DON'T CHECK field (#5) of the INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS file 
 (#38.6) to a value of "DON'T CHECK" for a number of the Z07 Consistency 
 Checks (CC).  A copy of the directive can be found at the following 
 link:
  
 http://vaww1.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1701
  
 After installation of this patch, the DELETE^IVMZ07C will be modified 
 to only use the USE FOR Z07 CHECK field (#6) when determining whether 
 or not a particular Z07 inconsistent data element should be removed 
 from the INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5).  This will synchronize the 
 output of the Inconsistent Data Elements Report [DG CONSISTENCY PRINT] 
 option and the Z07 Build Consistency Check option [DG Z07 CONSISTENCY 
 CHECK].  In order for Z07 inconsistencies, for which the data has been 
 previously corrected, to be removed one of two things will need to 
 occur, as follows:
  
 (1)  The patient would have to have an event that would trigger an 
 unsolicited full data transmission (ORU~Z07) to the Health Eligibility 
 Center (HEC), OR, 
 (2)  Site personnel would need to run the Z07 Build Consistency Check 
 [DG Z07 CONSISTENCY CHECK] option for the patient in question.
  
 Similar changes were made in patch IVM*2.0*132 and released previous
 to this patch. Patch IVM*2.0*132 should be installed before this patch.
