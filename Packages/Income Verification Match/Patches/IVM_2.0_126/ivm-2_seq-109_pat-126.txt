Subject: FIX IVM ADDR UPDT PENDING REVIEW REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Sites are receiving the IVM ADDRESS PENDING REVIEW report daily via 
 MailMan.  The site personnel must then manually go into the IVM UPLOAD 
 DEM option to validate these address changes that were sent from the 
 Health Eligibility Center (HEC).  The problem is, some of the veterans on 
 the report do not show up in the IVM UPLOAD DEM option.  This patch, 
 IVM*2.0*126, will update the report builder routine to exclude any 
 veteran from the report that will not appear on the IVM UPLOAD DEM option.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):

 HD0000000176366 - IVM ADDRESS UPDATES PENDING REVIEW PROBLEM
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000176366 - IVM ADDRESS UPDATES PENDING REVIEW PROBLEM
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Veterans are appearing on the IVM ADDRESS PENDING REVIEW report to be 
 validated by site personnel.  However, these veterans do not show up as a 
 selectable choice when the site personnel go into the IVM UPLOAD DEM 
 option to review and verify the address update sent from the HEC.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 There is a programming bug in the Z05 builder routine at the HEC.  This 
 bug has been fixed with HEC patch IVMB*2.0*825 (ADDRESS, ENROLLMENT, 
 INQUIRE VIVA FIXES) to prevent the problem from re-occurring.  However, 
 existing Z05 messages that have already been transmitted to the VistA 
 sites prior to patch IVMB*2.0*825's implementation will continue to show 
 up on the VistA site's IVM ADDRESS PENDING REVIEW report.  A filter will 
 be added to routine IVMLDEM9, which builds the report, to exclude any 
 veteran that will not appear on the IVM UPLOAD DEM option.
  
 Test Sites:
