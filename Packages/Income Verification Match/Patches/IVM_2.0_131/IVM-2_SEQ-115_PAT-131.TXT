Subject: FIX ERROR ON DOD UPLOAD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses potential patient safety issue PSI-05-034, PSPO 
 #169. For this reason, it is imperative this patch be installed by the 
 compliance date in order to mitigate any potential patient safety issues.
  
 When the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) sends an HL7 ORU~Z05 Demographic
 Data Transmission containing an invalid Date of Death to VistA, an entry 
 for the veteran is displayed by means of the site's Demographics Upload 
 [IVM UPLOAD DEM] option. A user may manually review the entry and choose 
 to upload the DOD data into VistA. No check is performed by the software 
 to determine whether the veteran is currently an Inpatient at the VistA 
 site. Thus, if the user so chooses, the erroneous date of death 
 information is immediately uploaded into the PATIENT file (#2). As a
 consequence, current inpatients are erroneously marked as deceased.
  
 This patch, IVM*2.0*131, will prevent a date of death from being
 erroneously uploaded into the VistA database on active inpatients. When a
 VistA site receives an ORU~Z05 transmission containing a spurious date of
 death for a veteran who is an active inpatient, this patch modifies the
 Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] option to reject the update. The
 patch will send a mail bulletin to the DGEN ELIGIBILITY ALERT mail group
 requesting removal of the invalid Date of Death from the veteran's record.
  
 NOTE: This patch does not address pre-existing entries. However, if an 
 entry is already in the IVM UPLOAD DEM tool, it will be automatically 
 removed by the natural process if a new Z05 comes in again for that 
 veteran.
