Subject: HEALTH CONCERNS

Category:

Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) application will address
 an issue occurring in the HealthShare operational mode updates. The V 
 Health Factors file currently populates the Health Concerns container in 
 HealthShare. Sites that are heavy users of health factors are seeing 
 significant delays in update queue processing. No HealthShare clients 
 are pulling this data yet, so this patch will stop populating this 
 container until further analysis can be done.
  
 The VPR event listeners for the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) and Text 
 Integration Utilities (TIU) applications have also been streamlined to 
 reduce the number of tasks created to collect and post encounter 
 related patient data.
