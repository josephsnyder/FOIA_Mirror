Description:
============

 VHA has recently identified interactive kiosks as an innovation that will
 enable VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) to enhance services to veterans and 
 improve the efficiency of operations. Many Veterans Integrated Service
 Networks (VISNs), and VAMCs have already implemented kiosks in the past,
 and are currently using them to provide streamlined approaches for
 veterans to perform various tasks.
  
 The VA's vision for VA Point of Service (VPS) kiosk devices is to 
 streamline and improve patient clinical and administrative processes
 across the VA healthcare network, and to provide standard, easy-to-use
 capabilities for patients and employees to access and update information
 and perform business transactions through incremental releases. The VA's
 vision includes a modular and configurable solution that may be tailored
 to fit each facility's individual needs.
  
 The VPS Kiosk Application Server utilizes RPC Broker to make calls to the
 Remote Procedures (RPCs) residing on the VistA host. This patch delivers
 functionality that will support components delivered in VPS*1*1, and will
 deliver additional functionality to support the Vetlink client.
  
  
 Overview of items in the VPS package:
 -------------------------------------
  
 Option VPS KIOSK INTERFACE    [VPS KIOSK INTERFACE] - This option contains
 the RPCs that support the VPS Kiosk system (refer to list below). The
 Vetlink Kiosk system will call upon these RPCs for specific events
 triggered by the kiosk machine accessed by a patient (e.g., at check-in)
 or by VAMC staff.
  
 New RPCs
 --------
 VPS EDIT PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC - RPC will receive the data request to make
 edits to the patient record in the PATIENT file (#2).
  
 VPS PATIENT CHECK-IN - The veteran can be checked-in by VAMC staff or by
 self check-in using VIC card via the VETLINK VPS kiosk. Check-in request
 will be submitted to this RPC.
  
 VPS PATIENT PRE-REGISTRATION - RPC will accept the pre-registration
 request submitted by the VETLINK VPS kiosk.
  
 VPS GET SITES - RPC will return the list of facilities at which the
 veteran was treated.
  
 VPS GET DFN - RPC will return the patient DFN. 
  
 VPS FULLSSN - Returns a list of patients with associated SSNs that match
 the value stored in ID.
  
 VPS LAST5 - Returns a list of patients matching LastNameInitial_Last4SSN
 based on Restricted Patient List.
  
 VPS LIST ALL - Returns a list of patients matching input value if "NAME"
 or "IEN^NAME".
 
 VPS GET2 PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC - Given patient SSN, DFN, ICN, or VIC/CAC, 
 this RPC returns the patient demographic data. 
  
 Pre-existing RPCs (already at sites)
 ------------------------------------
 ORWRP PRINT REPORT - Given patient DFN, Health Summary Type, Exam ID and Report
 ID, this RPC prints health summary report. 
 This RPC is the same RPC used by CPRS to print the report.
 
 
 VPS GET PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC - This RPC will accept patient SSN as input
 then retrieve patient demographic data from VistA.
  
 VPS GET CLINIC - This RPC will accept a partial or full Clinic Name as
 input then retrieves Clinic IEN, Clinic Name, Clinic Physical Location
 from VistA based on the matching Clinic Name characters from the INPUT
 String.
  
 XWB GET VARIABLE VALUE - This pre-existing RPC BROKER RPC accepts the name
 of a variable which will be evaluated and its value returned to the
 server. For example, this RPC may be called with a parameter like DUZ
 which will be returned as 123456.
