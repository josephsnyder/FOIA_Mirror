Subject: RMPR GUI FIXES

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes multiple issues with the Prosthetics GUI 
 (graphical user interface) Suite.
  
 1) The Extended Description free text memo box automatically positions 
    the cursor on the second line instead of the first line.
  
 2) If a description contains a double quote (") it will display as a 
    single quote (') in the National Prosthetics Patient  Database (NPPD)
    Display report.
  
 3) It's possible to have multiple primary Health Care Financing 
    Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) items on an
    Orthotic Lab & Work Order (OWL).
  
 4) On the Purchase Order Control screen if the "Display/Refresh" button 
    is hit (without selecting a new site), the system will populate the
    incorrect site information.
  
 5) No matter which Orthotic Lab & Work Order (OWL) is selected it will 
    print to the default Orthotic Lab printer of the first order.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1)HD0000000194799   Zeroes appending to dollar amount in Unit Cost field
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
  While on the "Add Item" when creating a Purchase Order if the user
 selects the "Extended Desc" button, the memo box defaults to the second
 line.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  Modify the Memo box properties so that it starts on the first line.
  
  
  
 2)HD0000000220387 - The double quote symbol (") is being displayed in the 
                     National Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD) Display
                     Report as the single quote symbol (').
  
 Problem:
 --------
  Currently when a description contains a double quote (") it will display
  as a single quote (') in the National Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD)
  Display report.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  Modifications were made to no longer convert all double quote symbols 
  (") to single quote symbols (').
  
  
 3)HD0000000223920 - On an Orthotic Lab & Work Order (OWL) it's possible 
                     to have multiple primary Health Care Financing
                     Administration Common Procedure Coding System
                     (HCPCS) items.
  
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
  When adding Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding
  System (HCPCS) items to a Work Order there should only be one Primary
  item per work order, however depending on the number of Health Care 
  Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) items
  added there is potential for multiple primary Health Care Financing
  Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) items.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  The code currently looks for a value of 1 in the first position of the
  Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System
  (HCPCS) items Internal Entry Number (IEN) to determine if it is the
  primary.  This was done under the assumption that there would be less
  than 10 Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding
  System (HCPCS) items. The code was modified to handle any number of
  Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding
  System (HCPCS) items.
  
 4)HD0000000236144 - GUI (graphical user interface) Purchase Order Control
                     screen refresh problem after a user exits a Purchase
                     order.
  
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
  On the Purchase Order Control screen, after a user selects
  a site and displays the list of consults, they have the
  ability to create a Purchase Order against that consult.  
  While in the Purchase Order form if they select a different
  site it will replace the variable Site Internal Entry Number
  (IEN) with the newly selected site, the problem is when the
  user returns to the Purchase Order Control screen and hits the
  "Display/Refresh" button without selecting a new site (or re-selecting
  the old site), it uses the new Site Internal Entry Number
  (IEN) to display even though it indicates a different site for
  the report.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  Every time the "Display/Refresh button is selected it will
  reset the variable Site Internal Entry Number (IEN) with 
  whatever the user has selected for the site at that point.
  
  
  
 5)HD0000000236010 - The Orthotic Lab & Work Order (OWL) Form is using the
                     incorrect National Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD)
                     Site.
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
  The Orthotic Lab & Work Order (OWL) Form is using the incorrect National 
  Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD) Site. When the Orthotic Lab & Work 
  Order (OWL) form is loaded it sets the National Prosthetics Patient 
  Database (NPPD) Site equal to the Internal Entry Number (IEN) 669.9
  record of the first entry.  The problem is, when a different Work Order
  is selected it does not use the Internal Entry Number (IEN) 669.9 value
  for that entry, instead it uses the one that was originally set when the
  form was created.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  Each time a new work order is selected it will reset the National 
  Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD) Site to match what the user currently
  has selected.
  
  
  
 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION DISTRIBUTION:
 ======================================== 
 Sites may retrieve the new GUI and documentation directly via FTP. The 
 preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany:             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
 Hines:              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
 Salt Lake City:     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 Filename                    Description
 ========                    ===========
 RMPR_3_143_201.EXE          Software Executable
  
  
 NOTE: These files must be transferred using the binary (BIN) file 
 transfer mode.  The size of the file once downloaded will be 3,010 KB
  
  
 GUI Installation Instructions
 =============================
  
 1) Once the executable has been retrieved double click on it to start the 
    unzip process.
  
 2) Select the location to unzip the files and click "Unzip".
  
 3) Once the files have been unzipped, navigate to the directory where the
    files were placed and run the "Setup.exe" executable.
  
 4) If a prior version of the GUI exists on your system, the first time
    through it will remove the old GUI and all related files.  Once the
    old files are removed you will have to run the "Setup.exe"
    executable again to install the new files.
  
 *If no prior versions of the GUI exist it will only be necessary to run
  the "Setup.exe" once.
