Subject: PROSTHETIC INTERFACILITY CONSULTS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch provides the ability for Prosthetics to electronically send and
 process consult or order requests between VAMC facilities. Users will be 
 able to request a consult at their facility and the consult will be 
 electronically delivered to the consulting facility.
  
 The quality of patient care will be improved by increasing the efficiency 
 and reliability of the communication of inter-facility information and by
 providing facilities with access to complete and up-to-date patient
 information.
  
 Description of '****Discontinued****' will be displayed in the Suspense
 Processing screen if the consult is discontinued by the provider.
  
  PROSTHETICS IFC SETUP
 Each VAMC should set up a consult for RECEIVING consults and additionally
 should set up a consult for each VAMC that they are SENDING consults to.
  
 (For additional information regarding Inter-Facility Consults, please
 refer to the Inter-Facility Consults Implementation Guide (October 2002),
 pages 4-5, 24 and 29.) 
  
  a)     The software that allows the consult data to populate into the
 PROSTHETIC SUSPENSE file (#668) requires that the name of the
 Service/Specialty in Consults follows a specific character format.  All
 Prosthetics service/specialty entries must start with the characters
 "PROSTHETICS IFC".  If this protocol is not followed, the consult
 data will not enter the Prosthetics application.
  b)     For consistency and to assure that there will be no conflicts in
 IFC consult naming between potential sending/receiving systems,
 Prosthetics is requiring that the Receiving VAMC's station number be
 appended immediately after "PROSTHETICS IFC"
  c)     The Consults package menu option "Set up Consult Services  [GMRC
 SETUP REQUEST SERVICES] should be used to create the Service/Specialty
 entries as follows:
  
    1)   For the VAMC receiving the consult:
         It is recommended that the service name be set up before the
 sending facility creates their Service/Specialty entry because the name of
 this service will be shared with the sending facility.
         (Example of RECEIVING consult service name: "PROSTHETICS IFC
 nnn", where "nnn" is this VAMC's three to five character station
 number.)
         The data field, IFC SENDING FACILITY, must include the name(s)
 of the VA Medical Center(s) sending the consult.  Note: this is a multiple
 field and more than one VAMC can send an Inter-Facility Consult to this
 service.
  
    2)   For the VAMC sending the consult:
         Since the consult will not be processed locally, most of the data
 fields can be left blank.  It is recommended that the service name of
 this consult be human readable.  (Example:  "PROSTHETICS IFC aaa",
 where aaa is text that is easily understood to be the VAMC that is
 RECEIVING the consult, such as the facility name or abbreviation.)
 It is required that the characters "IFC" are part of the consult name.
         The following fields are required:
            o PROVISIONAL DX PROMPT must be set to REQUIRE.
            o PROVISIONAL DX INPUT must be set to LEXICON.
            o IFC ROUTING SITE must be set to the name of the VAMC that
 will receive the Inter-Facility Consult.
            o IFC REMOTE NAME must be the name of the service at the
 receiving facility and it must exactly match the text that is entered
 as the receiving consult at that VAMC. If this name does not match the
 name of the service at the routing site, the request will fail to be
 filed at the remote site.  This will delay or prohibit the performance
 and processing of this request.  Coordination with the receiving
 facility should occur before creating this entry to avoid problems.
 (Example of SENDING site's IFC REMOTE NAME: "PROSTHETICS IFC
 nnn", where "nnn" is the three to five character station number
 of the VAMC that will be receiving the consult.  Coordination with the
 RECEIVING VAMC staff is required to assure that this data is entered
 correctly.)
