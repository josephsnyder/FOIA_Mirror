 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD194741  ERROR: $ZE= <UNDEFINED>PRT+2^RMPRP21
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using reprint Purchase Card Order, users receive an error due to 
 the Archive/Purge of the CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file (#410) which contains
 a pointer from the PROSTHETICS 1358 file (#664) to the CONTROL POINT 
 ACTIVITY file (#410) where node 0 no longer exists.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRP21 to insure variable 'CP' exists when using the
 relational pointer to the CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file (#410)from the 
 PROSTHETICS 1358 file (#664).
  
  
 2. HD193941  RMPR INV DEACTIVATE - option does not honor case 
                      sensitivity
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Deactivate Inventory Location option [RMPR INV DEACTIVATE],
 the option does not allow entry of lower case when a new location may have
 been entered using the Add Inventory Location or Items option [RMPR INV 
 ADD].   
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRPIY7 to allow upper AND lower case for Location 
 entry when using the Deactivate Inventory Location option [RMPR 
 INV DEACTIVATE].
  
  
 3. HD195392   Delete stock issue on an inactive HCPCS item. 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When deleting (returning) a stock issue against an inactive PIP Inventory 
 Item the process does so without warning leaving a "ghostly" PIP 
 Inventory Item that cannot be seen on inventory HCPCS report or re-issued.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Site requested that when returning stock against an inactive PIP 
 Inventory Item that the user be warned about same and given opportunity to
 activate the PIP Inventory Item affected and reset reorder point to zero
 if desired so no future ROP alerts appear for "reactivated" item. Modified
 routine RMPRPIYF to ask user if item should be reactivated, and, if so,
 whether they would like reorder point set to zero.
  
  
 4. HD200240   Option Print OIF/OEF Items Issued problem
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The Print OIF/OEF Items Issued option [RMPR PRINT OIF/OEF ITEMS]
 does not do anything after displaying the prompt START WITH ENTRY DATE:
 FIRST//, it simply quits.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Print OIF/OEF Items Issued option [RMPR PRINT OIF/OEF ITEMS] sent with
 patch RMPR*3.0*60 will be updated with correct entries for FLDS: [RMPR 
 OIF/OEF PSAS VETS] and BY: [RMPR OIF/OEF PSAS VETS].
  
  
 5. HD208232   Patient SSN security risk - SSN displays under CLAIM NUMBER
               on PO print.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 At times it is possible that a Patient's Claim Number can be there Social
 Security number and will print under CLAIM NUMBER during PO printing.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Decision made by the Prosthetics Development group (supporting site 
 recommendation) to remove all printing of CLAIM NUMBER data (which, at 
 times, may contain patient Social Security number) on PO form during 
 reprint or when creating Purchase Card order.
