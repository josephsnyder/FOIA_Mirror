 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) HD0000000291098 Remove field from printed Prosthetics Patient Purchase
                    Order
  
 Problem:
 --------
 On the printed Purchase Order, field #8 "ID #" is the last 4 digits of 
 the patient's SSN. It has been determined by VACP Privacy Service that 
 we can no longer print these digits on the Purchase Order. This affects
 the printed Purchase Order from the GUI Purchasing and the reprint 
 options [Reprint a 2421 Form] and [Reprint a Purchase Card Form]
 from Vista roll & scroll. Field #8 data of last 4 digits of social 
 security number must be removed from the printed Prosthetics patient
 Purchase Orders.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify print routines RMPR4P21 (for Purchase Order reprint) and RMPR9P21
 for printing Purchase Order via GUI entry. Also, modify print routine
 RMPRP21 for reprint of 2421 form. 
  
  
  
 2) HD0000000300012 Prosthetics - Change in NPPD line names
  
 Problem:
 --------
 As part of the continuing changes to the NPPD/HCPCS change the title of 
 NPPD line 100 E and 100 F.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPRN62 and RMPRN72 for the following:
  
 NPPD Line #      Old Description    New Description
 ===================================================
 100 E            CUSHION FOAM       CUSHION
 100 F            CUSHION SPEC       CUSHION CUSTOM
  
 Due to the change of these two descriptions, the NPPD USER MANUAL will be 
 updated.
  
  
 3) HD0000000305290 FGH - still getting error <UNDEFINED>HDR+2^RMPRN63
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A new repair code R60 E was sent out for HCPCS E2508 and never reported
 as an update needed to NPPD reporting tables.
  
 Resolution:
 ------------
 Modified NPPD reporting tables to add repair code R60 E.
  
 Routines:  RMPRN62, RMPRN72
  
  
 4) HD0000000309135 Security clause on Prosthetics patient PO
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The Privacy Act printed on Purchase orders has been modified to a new 
 standard Security clause per VACO to the following:
  
 VAAR- 852.273-75 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION
                  TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES (Interim - October 2008)
  
 (a) The contractor and their personnel shall be subject to the same 
 Federal laws, regulations, standards and VA policies as VA personnel,
 regarding information and information system security. These include, but 
 are not limited to Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
 Appendix III of 0MB Circular A-130, and guidance and standards, available 
 from the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and
 Technology (NIST). This also includes the use of common security 
 configurations available from NIST's Web site at:
 http://checklists.nist.gov.
  
 (b) To ensure that appropriate security controls are in place, 
 contractors must follow the procedures set forth in 'VA Information and 
 Information System Security/Privacy Requirements for IT Contracts' 
 located at the following Web site: http://wnw.iprm.oit.va.gov.
  
 (c) These provisions shall apply to all contracts in which VA sensitive
 information is stored, generated, transmitted, or exchanged by VA, a 
 contractor, subcontractor or a third-party, or on behalf of any of 
 these entities regardless of format or whether it resides on a VA 
 system or contractor/subcontractor's electronic information system(s)
 operating for or on the VA's behalf.
  
 (d) Clauses (a) and (b) shall apply to current and future contracts and
 acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, job orders, task 
 orders, letter contracts, purchase orders, and modifications. Contracts
 grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. do not include
 '6301 et seq.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ------------
 Modified Privacy Act statement on Patient Purchase Orders for 2421 and 
 Purchase Card orders reprinted on VISTA.  Also, added to printed Purchase 
 Order via GUI windows print selection.
  
 Due to the new security clause, the purchase orders are significantly 
 longer.  In order to accommodate the security clause on the purchase
 orders, the line length of printers will need to be set to at least 60.
  
 Also, the Privacy clause will now always print when an order is printed 
 from the Prosthetics GUI suite whether user selects Windows or Vista 
 printer. The clause will print on new page when printing to Vista 
 printer, but will directly follow the Purchase Order information when 
 printing to Windows.
