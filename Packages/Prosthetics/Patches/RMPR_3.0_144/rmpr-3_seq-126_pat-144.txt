 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000223734 - OWL attaches wrong DD23 - roll/scroll item detail
                      display of 2319
  
 Problem:
 --------
 For original test sites and any other site using the outdated GUI version
 of the Prosthetics Suite (Version 3.7.136.207), processing allowed a
 Purchase Order against an OWL work order, but it may also link (within the
 same session) all subsequent Purchase Orders to the same work request.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Ensure you have the correct version of the Prosthetics Suite GUI and
 the correct KIDS build (Version 3.7.136.207). Routine PRMP121C is modified
 to not link the Purchase Order item to a work request if the patient does
 not match.
  
 A post-install routine was written to audit the RECORD OF PROS
 APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660) for ordered items that have a invalid
 link to an OWL work request with a different patient and removes the link
 when found.  The corrected entries are stored in file ^XTMP("RMPR144P")
 for 6 months in case recovery is deemed necessary by the National 
 Prosthetics Program Office. 
  
  
 2. HD0000000232942 -  <UNDEFINED>F+2^DIED
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When an OWL work order is created against a suspense record another
 user opened, the system causes the processing error <UNDEFINED>F+2^DIED
 during the broker call from GUI to VISTA.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR29GU to exit properly when a suspense record being 
 worked is currently locked by another user. Also, modify routine
 RMPR29CA to account for filing errors in the PROSTHETIC SUSPENSE file
 (#668) in AMIS nodes 10 and 11.
  
 3. HD0000000233940  Prosthetics software - Add/Change NPPD Lines for FY08
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Prosthetics software - Add/Change NPPD lines for FY08. Make needed 
 changes to NPPD lines ensuring no errors occur when new 2008 HCPCS 
 are released:
  
 a. Line 900 J: Change line description to INSTALLATION/LABOR
 b. Line 900 L: Change line description to RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT
 c. Line R90 A: Change line description to RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT
 d. Line 970 A: New line item for BIOLOGICAL IMPLANTS
  
 Shipping Charges were compiled/printed under R90A instead of under R99A,
 directly affecting the new line number R90A  for Recreational Equipment.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPRN62 and RMPRN72 for new line descriptions. Also,
 modify routines RMPRN6 and RMPRN7 to compile print Shipping Charges under
 line number R99A. Also, modified routines RMPRN6UT and RMPRN7UT to 
 account for 970 A being included in SURGICAL IMPLANTS (looking for items
 beginning with 96 only) when running option Print NPPD Single Line Detail.
 Modify RMPRN6UT, RMPRN7UT, RMPRN6PT and RMPRN7PT to handle new category
 for Biological Implants.
  
  
 4. HD0000000253066  Prosthetics Closed OWL/LAB Consult
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user closes an OWL consult the completion date does not contain
 the hours/mins with date of completion.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR29CA to set the completion date field in Suspense 
 record with date including hours/mins.
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION DISTRIBUTION:
 ===========================
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly via FTP (using BIN mode).  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany:                 ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    anonymous.software
  Hines:                  ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
