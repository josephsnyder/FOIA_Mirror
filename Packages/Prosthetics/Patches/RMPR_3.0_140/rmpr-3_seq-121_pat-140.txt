 Problem:
 --------
 To resolve problems with Purchase Card Orders cancelled in IFCAP and
 "dangling" amendments and order still open in Prosthetics.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR4C21 to bypass the IFCAP step in cancelling a 
 Prosthetics Purchase Card Order using option RMPR4 PCC [Cancel
 Purchase Card transaction].  Also, modify routines RMPR4OPN and
 RMPR4LOP to identify Prosthetic Purchase Card Orders that are open
 but have a cancellation on the IFCAP side. Option LIST OPEN PURCHASE
 CARD TRANSACTIONS will now notify user of this situation.

 from purged suspense between the PROSTHETIC SUSPENSE file (#668) and
 the PROSTHETIC 2529-3 file (#664.1).
  
  
 3. HD210818   Home Oxygen add/edit Prescription Date default null
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When using Add/Edit Home Oxygen Patient the HOME OXYGEN PRESCRIPTION 
 DATE will default as null when active dates are on file.

 DATE from patient's record in lieu of defaulting to Fileman tracking 
 global ^DISV for user.
