Subject: NEGATIVE GROUPER COUNTER;ED2 OPTION;NPPD LINES FOR 5-RENTAL

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following problems in the Prosthetics 
 application:
  
 1) There are some sites that have a negative value in the GROUPER COUNTER 
    FIELD.
  
 2) The system allows users to make changes to patient transactions which 
    are reflected on the 2319 (Prosthetics Veteran patient information
    report).    
  
 3) When users are viewing the NPPD Detail Display Report in the 
    Prosthetics GUI Suite,  Rental items have no information populated in
    the NPPD column.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000257832  Negative GROUPER COUNTER field in File #669.9
  
 Problem:
 --------
 OWL application not populating AMIS GROUPER field (#68) in the RECORD OF
 PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660) for sites that have a negative GROUPER
 COUNTER field (#11) in the PROSTHETICS SITE PARAMETERS file (#669.9).
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Write post-install routine RMPR150P that will check for OWL order issues
 using site that has a negative GROUPER COUNTER field (#11) and AMIS
 GROUPER field (#68) in the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660) is
 null and correct by setting site parameter counter field to 99999999 and
 assigning next sequential number to 660 issue AMS GROUPER field (#68).
  
 Also, the GROUPER COUNTER field (#11) in the PROSTHETICS SITE PARAMETERS 
 file (#669.9) Input Transform has been modified to prevent staff from 
 using Fileman to create a new Site Parameter file entry with a Grouper 
 Counter that could become a negative number in time.  In reality, staff 
 should NEVER use Fileman to make a new entry in the PROSTHETICS SITE 
 PARAMETERS file (#669.9).
  
 In addition, the post install routine will insure that any site parameter 
 with a Grouper Counter less than 55555555 will be modified to 85000000.
  
  
 2. HD0000000267263  Prosthetics software - option ED2
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Fiscal integrity issue when using menu option Edit 2319 [ED2] to make
 changes to the patient transactions which are reflected on the 2319.  User
 is able to change Vendor, Cost, and Quantity.  However, these changes do
 not carry over into IFCAP.  Therefore, the Purchase Order information on
 the 2319, which is used for billing purposes, FPDS purposes and NPPD
 purposes, does not necessarily match the Purchase Order information in
 IFCAP.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRE29 to no longer edit the fields vendor, cost, 
 quantity in menu option Edit 2319 [ED2]. Add new option Edit 2319 
 (Vendor,QTY,Cost)[ED2C] that will allow editing of ONLY Vendor, Quantity
 and Cost.  Lock this menu option with RMPRSUPERVISOR key. New option calls
 new routine RMPRE29C to edit Vendor, Quantity and Cost.
  
  
 3. HD0000000275333  NPPD lines not appearing for 5-Rental items
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Problem identified that when using Prosthetics GUI Suite for NPPD Display 
 Detail Report that Rental (5) items appear with no NPPD line listed.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR9LNP to use NPPD repair line number as it does with 
 Repair (X).
  
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:

      Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
