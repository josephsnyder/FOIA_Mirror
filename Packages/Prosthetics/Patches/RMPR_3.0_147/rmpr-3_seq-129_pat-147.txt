 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000249441  Prosthetics Home Oxygen Software
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Prosthetics Data Validation Group has determined that Home Oxygen
 billing for a patient with an expired prescription and no forthcoming
 renewal has become a burden each month to insure ongoing monthly
 billing.  To accomplish billing, sites were extending the prescription
 expiration date to insure billing but the patient now had a "fictitious"
 expiration showing on the Prescription Expiration Dates report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRBIL0 to bypass prescription expiration date check and 
 bill Home Oxygen item even if billing month is past patient prescription 
 expiration date.
  
  
 2. HD0000000246327  Credit Card Number printed on invoice
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Purchase Card Number is encrypted when printing PO invoice on desktop
 printer either at completion of P.O. creation via GUI Prosthetics Suite or
 reprint Purchase Order on Vista.  This multiply encrypted number occurs
 when user received "Insufficient Funds" error when submitting PO, as each
 time resubmitted an encryption occurs on top of any preceding encryption.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR121B to delay the Purchase Card number 
 encryption until the order has been validated within IFCAP logic. 
 This will prevent secondary encryptions on field that is no longer the
 original Purchase Card number.
