 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 ======================= 
 1. HD0000000229317  Duplicate encounters in PCE when editing Purchase 
                     Order items through the option [RMPR EDIT 2319]
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reports that duplicate encounters are occurring during edit of 
 Purchase Order item.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRE29 to not invoke encounter create link when 
 Purchase Order item is edited.
  
  
 2. HD0000000235522  EDIT INVENTORY ITEM - not allow edit of VENDOR
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reports that when editing inventory item the option [RMPR INV EDIT]
 allows edit of Vendor, but the vendor is NOT changed to new value.  
 Prosthetics development states that they should not be allowed to ever
 edit the vendor of inventory item.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRPIY6 to not allow editing of Vendor field when using 
 option RMPR INV EDIT [Edit Inventory Items].
  
  
 3. HD0000000238766  Discontinue Prosthetic PCE's
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Prosthetics development team  in conjunction with the DSS Program 
 office and the Prosthetics Program Office have agreed to a national fix to
 discontinue creating/deleting/editing PCE encounters for issues and
 purchase order items.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPRPCEA, RMPRPCEB, and RMPRPCED to not execute
 linking logic to create/update/delete PCE encounters from issued/purchase
 order items.  Also, make option RMPR PCE TASK MANAGER 'out of order'.
  
  
 4. HD0000000241190  Eliminate rejected Prosthetic PCE's
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Prosthetics is no longer required to automatically create the Prosthetic
 PCE's in stop code 423 Prosthetics Clinic, so eliminate the rejected
 Prosthetic PCE's that are waiting for corrective action on the 'Action
 Required' [SCRPW Action Required Report] report. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Created post-install routine to look at every Prosthetic PCE created from
 issue/Purchase Order item for missing contaminants and update with proper
 contaminant coding.
