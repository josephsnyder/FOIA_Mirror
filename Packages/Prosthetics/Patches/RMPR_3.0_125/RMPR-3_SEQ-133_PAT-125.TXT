Description:
============

 1.      The Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare 
 Organizations (JCAHO) requires patients be notified when equipment has 
 been ordered for them. The Mandatory Notification enhancement will add 
 the following for Prosthetics and its users:
  
        a) Notify patients of all equipment ordered for them to be 
        delivered to their home.
  
        b) Batch all Notifications and send once a day after all 
        transactions for that day have been completed. The Option
        Delivery Verification Nightly Job  [RMPR DVN NIGHTLY JOB] option
        will be scheduled to run once a day before midnight.
  
        c) Create the means to resend notifications.  If a patient sends
        back a notification card stating the Item was not received, etc.
        Also, if determined by Prosthetic Clinical Management (PCM) they
        can send a server message to run a single date.
  
        d) Provide an option to enter data into the 
        #660 -- RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR FILE when the 
        Notification Cards are returned from the patient.
  
        e) Satisfy JCAHO requirements.
  
 The Deliver Verification Notice Data will be sent to:
         VHA Sacramento Regional Processing Center 
         The IP Address is:  vhamacappt.v21.med.va.gov
         The SFTP USERNAME is:  rmprftp (lowercase)
  
 The System Manager will need to do the file directory creation and SSH 
 Key creation found in the Installation Guide.  Once that part is complete 
 the Prosthetics Chief or designee can enter data in the Prosthetics Site
 Parameter file, also found in the Installation Guide.
