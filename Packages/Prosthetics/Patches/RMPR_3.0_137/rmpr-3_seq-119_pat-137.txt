 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD184989  Shipping charges not removed during CPO when using '@' or
              '0.00'.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using option [CPO    Reconcile/Close Out Purchase Card Transaction]
 entering '@' or '0.00' will not clear shipping charge to zero and delete 
 the associated shipping entry in the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file 
 (#660).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR4E21 to check for entry of @ or 0.00 and convert entry 
 to 0 to allow the shipping charge to retain a value of zero and delete the
 associated shipping entries in the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file 
 (#660).
  
  
 2. HD146550   L code grouping calculator problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 L code grouping calculator problem where linked L code issues are not
 appearing as a single line with detail explosion.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Problem caused by negative numbers introduced in the SITE PARAMETER
 file (#669.9) in the Grouper Counter field (#11) when the site was
 set up. Will modify RMPRPAT2 to resolve negative counter.
  
  
 3. HD185298   2319 not displaying pre patient merged 660 records
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a patient has merged records in the PATIENT file (#2) the 2319
 display/queued print for appliance/oxygen issues only display for the
 current patient registration and not the previous activity under the old
 registration.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPRPAT2, RMPRPRT1 and RMPOBIL5 to check for patient
 merged activity and look for any appliance/oxygen issue activity under
 both the new internal IEN and the previous internal IEN.
  
  
 4. HD134733  List Open Purchase Card transactions by Initiator report
              has Purchase Card Orders cancelled in GUI.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a Purchase Card Order was placed through the GUI Prosthetics Order
 process an unanswered "insufficient funds" error would cause the IFCAP 
 order for same to be cancelled, but not the corresponding order in the
 Prosthetics 1358 file (#664).
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR121B to cancel BOTH the IFCAP and Prosthetics order
 when the user receives a message for insufficient funds. The cancel status
 for BOTH will be undone if a subsequent increase to funds is made before
 exiting the order or the session times out, and the order is signed.
