Description:
============

 This patch updates the current "View Prosthetics Billing Information" 
 (1.3.96.10) stand alone GUI to enhance security measures when exporting
 data via excel. To aid in the identification of the "View Prosthetics
 Billing Information" executable, the icon associated is the ($) dollar
 sign and not the "doctors bag".

 Remedy Overview
 =====================
 HD0000000253248  Prosthetics GUI Vista Suite - Issue with
                      View Billing
   
 Problem:
 -------------
 When using the "View Prosthetics Billing Information" stand alone GUI,
 while exporting data to excel, a .csv file is temporarily saved to
 the hard drive.  The location of this temporary file, which may
 contain patient identifiable information, is hard coded.  It has 
 been decided by the Clinical Prosthetics and Logistics Office that
 the user should have the ability to specify a secure location to
 temporarily save this file. 
   
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 Upon clicking the excel button to export the information a message
 box pops up notifying the user that they are about to export potential
 patient identifiable information and they have the ability to select
 "OK"  to proceed or "Cancel"  to quit.  If they select "OK , a dialog
 box pops up allowing the user to select a directory.  Once they 
 choose a directory the temporary .csv opens allowing
 the user to permanently save the report if they choose.  The user will
 be unable to export another report or navigate away from the form
 until the temporary .csv file is closed allowing it to be deleted.
 To assist the user in locating the temporary .csv file, the path will
 be displayed on the current form.
  
 This will be consistent with the Prosthetics Vista Suite (GUI).

 Installation Instructions
 =========================
  
 1) Once the executable has been retrieved double click on it to start the 
    unzip process.
  
 2) Select the location to unzip the files and click "Unzip".
  
 3) Once the files have been unzipped, navigate to the directory where the
    files were placed and run the "Setup.exe" executable.
  
 4) If a prior version of the GUI exists on your system, the first time
    through it will remove the old GUI and all related files.  Once the
    old files are removed you will have to run the "Setup.exe"
    executable again to install the new files.
  
 *If no prior versions of the GUI exist it will only be necessary to run
  the "Setup.exe" once.
