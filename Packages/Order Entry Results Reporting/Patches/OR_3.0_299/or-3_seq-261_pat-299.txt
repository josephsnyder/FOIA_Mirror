Description:

 The purpose of this patch is to assist sites by correcting truncated 
 patient instructions in the ORDERS file (#100). This patch (OR*3*299) 
 should be installed as soon as possible after the installation of 
 OR*3*243.

 Overview:
 =========
 1. HD0000000236377    Patient instructions are truncated
  
    Problem:
    --------
    For very lengthy patient instructions, there was the possibility, 
    before OR*3*243, that they could be truncated when sent from Outpatient
    Pharmacy V. 7.0 to Order Entry/Results Reporting V. 3.0 during the     
    finishing process in Pharmacy. Patch OR*3.0*243 corrects the problem
    with the truncation for new orders. However, OR*3*243 provided no way
    to identify or correct orders that had a problem.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORY299 will execute as a post-install routine. It will search
    through the last 365 days of Outpatient prescriptions, comparing
    patient instructions. A MailMan message will be sent to the person who
    installed the patch containing a report of all orders that had
    discrepancies. 
  
    The report will contain the orderable item name, dispense drug name, 
    prescription number and the internal entry number of the entry from the
    ORDERS file (#100) (OIEN on the report) as well as other information
    about the patient and order. There are two common ways to check the
    information: FileMan (using the OIEN) or viewing on the orders tab. 
    If, for example, you are using FileMan, you can retrieve the PACKAGE 
    REFERENCE field (#33) and use it to look up the prescription in the 
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52). Once you have a view of both file 100 and    
    file 52, you can compare the information to be sure it is correct. If 
    you are using the orders tab you can compare it to the meds tab.
  
    There is no way to predict how many, if any, of these will be 
    identified at each site. It will depend on how often the patient    
    instructions exceeded the length previously (pre-OR*3*243) in the   
    ORDERS file (#100).
  
    A sample report follows item #2.
  
 2. HD0000000236934    CQ16427 Prevent copy/renewal/transfer of orders 
                       with truncated patient instructions
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If the patient instructions from the ORDERS file (#100) does not match
    what is in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) when taking an action on an
    order we should force the provider to write a new order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------  
    In addition to reporting the orders, ORY299 will also correct the
    information in the ORDERS file (#100). It is important to check these 
    orders and verify the corrected information is accurate.
  
 Below is a sample output for the report:
  
 ***Note***
 If you notice a stop date in the format of //1700, there is not a problem.
 When you review the order in FileMan or on the Orders tab, you will
 probably notice that the stop date is missing. You do not need to correct
 this date.
