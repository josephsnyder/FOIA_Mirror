1. For very lengthy patient instructions, there is the possibility that
"BLD",7476,1,2,0)
they can be truncated when transferred from Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to
"BLD",7476,1,3,0)
Order Entry/Results Reporting V. 3.0. Patch OR*3.0*243 corrects the
"BLD",7476,1,4,0)
problem with the truncation. However, there is no way to identify orders
"BLD",7476,1,5,0)
that need to be corrected. This patch corrects this problem by creating a 
"BLD",7476,1,6,0)
routine to search through the previous 365 days of Outpatient 
"BLD",7476,1,7,0)
prescriptions, comparing patient instructions. A report will be sent to 
"BLD",7476,1,8,0)
the person who installs the patch. It will be sorted by division.
