 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000296365 - <SUBSCRIPT>GUI+14^ORCDLR2 ERROR OCCURED 7 DAYS FROM
                      1/2 - 1/12 3009.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Signing multiple Lab Collect orders in CPRS GUI can result in a crash
    if there are scheduling messages involved.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    GUI^ORCDLR2 was using a node of the ^TMP global reserved for 
    SCHEDULE^ORCDLR2 and the data was being overwritten. GUI^ORCDLR2 now 
    uses its own node.
  
  
 2. HD0000000415212 - Quick Order creation: missing additional dose box.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In CPRS GUI, selecting 'Intermittent' for the 'Type' drop down field in
    the IV medication order form enables the 'Give Additional Dose Now'
    checkbox.  However, creating a system level quick order of the same
    type did not show the same option. This meant that it was not possible
    to create system level quick orders which utilize that checkbox.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Entry Action NOW^ORCDPS3 only ran for orders with dosage information.
    It will now also run for intermittent type IV medications.
  
    NOTE:
    -----
    This patch addresses the VistA portion of this problem.  OR*3*290 
    (under development) will contain the fix for the CPRS GUI portion.
