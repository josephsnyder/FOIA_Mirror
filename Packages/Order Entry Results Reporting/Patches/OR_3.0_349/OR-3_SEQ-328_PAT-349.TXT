Subject: AUDIOCARE AUTORENEWAL FOLLOW-UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects four issues in the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
  package:
   
  1. Add a description to the Parameter OR AUTORENEWAL USER.
   
  2. Use the OR AUTORENEWAL USER parameter value to populate the ENTERED 
     BY (#16) field in the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file for AudioRENEWAL 
     prescriptions. 
   
  3. MailMan messages from AudioRENEWAL module are not displaying enough
     information to quickly take appropriate follow-up action.
    
  4. Modify the AudioRENEWAL routine so that when the ordering provider
     of a renewable outpatient medication order has a status of terminated 
     or disusered has an active surrogate designated, the routine creates
     the new unsigned renewal order.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1. INC000000410605 - Need Parameter Definition added after release of
                       OR*3*336
   
  Problem:
  --------
  The parameter definition for OR AUTORENEWAL USER has no description.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  OR AUTORENEWAL USER parameter definition has been updated to include a
  description of the parameters usage.
   
  Parameter Definition Text:
  --------------------------
  This parameter points to a proxy user in the NEW PERSON (#200) file 
  created for the auto-renewal process. This value is used to populate
  the 'entered by' field in the ORDERS (#100) file, and the 'Entry by'
  field in the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file, and is the proxy user IEN placed
  in the AudioRenewal module User Parameters field 'Host User ID#'.
   
  2. INC000000444880 - AudioRenewal function
   
  Problem:
  --------
  When a site is using AudioRENEWAL functionality, the ENTERED BY (#16)
  field in the prescription (#52) file of the renewal order erroneously
  contains the name of the user who runs the option to process telephone
  refills. Renewal orders created by this functionality should use the
  proxy user name entered in the OR AUTORENEWAL USER parameter for the
  'entered by' field.
    
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routines ORAREN and ORWDXR have been modified to use the OR AUTORENEWAL 
  USER parameter value to populate the ENTERED BY (#16) field in the
  prescription (#52) file for AudioRENEWAL prescriptions. This allows the
  'entered by' name to match in CPRS order detail and Outpatient Pharmacy
  Package and identifies the order as a renewal created by the AudioRENEWAL
  process.
   
   
  3. INC000000446533 - Enhancement request for Audio Renewal
      
  Problem:
  --------
  The MailMan message with the subject line 'Renewal Requests not Sent 
  to Providers' reports requests that failed to create new unsigned renewal
  orders. There are many situations when a renewal may not process, such
  as patient chart locked, provider terminated, or RX status not active or
  expired. The second MailMan message has the subject line 'Renewal 
  Requests with Order Checks' and reports the order checks that are
  displayed to a provider who is beginning to write medication orders for a
  patient, for example, renal functions for patients over 65 years old or
  polypharmacy count. There is not enough information in the content of
  these messages to allow personnel to quickly and accurately take
  appropriate follow-up action.
    
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine ORAREN has been modified to add the name of the drug prescribed,
  the CPRS patient identifier (first initial of last name and last 4 of
  SSN), and the inactive providers name to the existing content of the 
  MailMan message. 
  
   
  4. INC000000507614 - Patient Safety Issue - AudioRENEWAL (AudioCare)
   
  Patient Safety Issue:
  --------------------
  PSPO #2164
   
  Problem:
  --------
  Currently, when an AudioRENEWAL request is processed and the outpatient 
  medication order is renewable but the ordering provider status is 
  terminated or disusered, the unsigned renewal order is not created. 
  An entry is made in the MailMan message with the subject line 'Renewal
  Requests not Sent to Providers' with the problem listed as 'Provider 
  flagged as <STATUS>', where status will state the problem with the
  provider. The person that calls in the renewal request is more than
  likely hearing the message "Your renewal request has been submitted.
  Please call back in <#> days for a status." If site personnel fail to
  take action on the problem listed in the MailMan message, the patient may
  call back days later to find out that no action has occurred on the
  renewal, or may not call until they have run out of the medication. This
  could create a situation where the patient misses multiple doses of a
  needed medication.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The AudioRENEWAL routine ORAREN has been modified so that when the 
  ordering provider of a renewable outpatient medication order has a status
  of terminated or disusered has an active surrogate designated, the
  routine 'accepts' the surrogate's active status and creates the new
  unsigned renewal order. This new unsigned order generates the ORDER
  REQUIRES ELEC SIGNATURE notification which is distributed based on
  surrogacy and provider recipient codes set for this notification in the
  Notification Mgmt. Menus.
  
  If no surrogate is assigned to inactive providers when renewals are 
  processed, the result will be the same as before this patch.  When the
  ordering provider is terminated or disusered, and there is NO 
  designated surrogate, NO renewal order is created. Since there is no 
  unsigned order, no notification is generated. An entry is made in the 
  MailMan message with the subject line 'Renewal Requests not Sent to 
  Providers' with the problem listed as 'Provider <name> flagged as 
  <STATUS>' where status will state the problem with the provider and
  <name> will contain the name of the inactive provider.
   
   
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  An updated AudioCARE Renewal Release Notes and Install Guide and 
  CPRS GUI Technical Manual will be distributed with OR*3*349.

  at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
     
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
     
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from 
  the first available FTP server.
