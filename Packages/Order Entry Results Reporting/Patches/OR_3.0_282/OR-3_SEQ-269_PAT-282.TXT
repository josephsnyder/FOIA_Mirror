Subject: LAB ORDER ISSUES IN CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. The parameter ORQQLR DATE RANGE INPT does not honor the location 
 information. 
 2. The 'How Long?' prompt in the Computerized Patient Record System 
 (CPRS) Lab order entry screen behaves inconsistently. 
 3. When placing a continuous lab order more than one day in duration, the 
 stop date is not displaying correctly.
 4. When a user selects both a parent order and one of its child orders at 
 the same time and discontinues them, an error box appears when signing 
 the discontinued orders.
 5. The signature and treating specialty information is not present for
 child lab orders. The 'How Often' information does not display the same 
 way on a child order.

 Overview:
 =========
 1. HD0000000069279      Setting parameters at location level
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The parameter ORQQLR DATE RANGE INPT does not honor the value at the
    location level.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORWCV has been modified to include the patient's location when 
    an inpatient is selected.
  
 2. HD0000000069365      HIN-0101-42518 HOW LONG PROMPT DIFFERENCES
    Duplicate:
    HD0000000069851      CMS-0802-31540 x# does not work correctly on ward
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When entering continuous lab orders with schedules that have a 'once 
    daily' frequency, a response to 'How Long?' of n or xn should calculate
    the same stop date/time.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORCSEND1 has been modified to use the collection date and time 
    of the last child order created as the stop date and time of the parent
    order when an inpatient is selected.
  
 3. HD0000000070009      UNY-0203-10404 Stop date on continuous orders
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When entering a continuous lab order, with a response to 'How Long?'
    that exceeds one day, the stop date is displaying incorrectly.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The change in item #2 for ORCSEND1 also corrects this issue. The
    collection date and time of the last child order created will be used
    as the stop date and time of the parent order.
  
 4. HD0000000070670      SDC-0404-60834 Discontinuing Continuous lab orders
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A provider accidentally selected both a parent lab order as well as 
    multiple child orders and then chose the action of 'discontinue'. Upon 
    signature, an error box displayed indicating the order had already been
    signed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Two changes have been made to address this issue. First, lab orders 
    will no longer display the parent order. Only the child orders will be 
    displayed once the parent order is signed and released to service. 
    Routine ORCSEND1 has been modified to 'veil' the parent order once the 
    child orders are all created.
  
    Second, routine ORQ2 was modified to include the parent's stop date 
    and time in the detail display of the child order. This refers to the 
    detail display from the Orders tab.
  
 5. HD0000000265320      Child Lab order does not show 'Ordered By'
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When troubleshooting an alert problem, it appears that the child 
    orders for a lab order do not show all the needed information. During 
    testing a site noticed that Treating Specialty was not included in the 
    order detail of the child orders. In addition, the 'How Often?' did 
    not display the same way on a child order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORCSEND3 was modified to treat child orders exactly as parent 
    orders or a single lab order. All the available information, such as 
    signature, order checks, etc. will now be found in the detailed display
    of each child order.
