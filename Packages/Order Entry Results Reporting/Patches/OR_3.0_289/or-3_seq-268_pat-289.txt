Subject: TRANSFER OF EXCEPT CONJUNCTION AND QUICK ORDER PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. When an Outpatient complex prescription contains an EXCEPT conjunction 
 there is a problem when it is transferred to Inpatient Medications. The 
 new order created does not adequately reflect the provider's intent. PSPO 
 #1031
 2. With the release of OR*3*243, there is no longer a 'Give additional 
 dose NOW' prompt in the Enter/edit quick orders [ORCM QUICK ORDERS] menu
 option. PSPO #1140
  
 Associated Remedy:
 ==================
 1. HD0000000269669 Transferring Complex Orders with the EXCEPT conjunction
 2. HD0000000277913  No first dose now option in VistA quick order edit

 Overview:
 =========
 1. HD0000000269669 Transferring Complex Orders with the EXCEPT conjunction
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The underlying issue is that inpatient orders do not have a feature for
    the EXCEPT conjunction.
  
    The order that I placed was an outpatient Rx for "Warfarin 5mg QPM
    EXCEPT 2.5mg TU-TH@2100".
  
    Upon transferring this order to inpatient, a complex order was created 
    that looked much like it would if the AND conjunction was used: 
    ultimately 2 separate orders, one for 5mg QPM and one for 2.5mg 
    TU-TH@2100.
  
    The only evidence to the pharmacist view when finishing the order is
    that the outpatient corresponding order displays and the word "EXCEPT"
    can be seen.
  
    As a result, if this occurred in a real situation, on Tuesdays and 
    Thursdays the order would be for 7.5mg total instead of the intended 
    2.5mg.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORCACT0 has been modified to ensure that complex orders that 
    contain a conjunction of EXCEPT cannot be transferred.
  
 2. HD0000000277913 No first dose now option in VistA quick order edit
  
    Problem:
    --------
    No first dose now option in the Enter/edit quick orders [ORCM QUICK
    ORDERS] option. This was available in v26.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORCDPS3 has been modified to correctly prompt for 'Give 
    additional dose NOW' whenever the schedule does not have a schedule
    type of ONE-TIME.
