Description:
============

 This tool was developed as Class 3 software at the Portland VA Medical 
 Center to help simplify the complex, time consuming processes required 
 to manage outpatients on anticoagulation medication. This patch brings
 the software up to Class 1 standards for national release. 
  
 The tool enables the user to enter, review, and continuously update all 
 information connected with patient anticoagulation management. With 
 the Anticoagulation Tracking, one can order lab tests, enter outside lab 
 results and graphically review lab data, enter notes, complete encounter 
 data, complete the consults if consults are used to initiate entry into 
 the Anticoagulation clinic, and print a variety of patient letters. Upon
 exiting the program all activities within the program are viewable on an
 Anticoagulation flow sheet located on the Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS) Reports tab. The Anticoagulation Tracking provides clinic 
 staff a mechanism of ensuring continuous patient monitoring with a 
 built-in mechanism that alerts staff when patients haven't been monitored 
 in a timely period. A Lost to Follow-up list is maintained to insure that 
 staff knows of patients who need attention.
  
 ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately
 after the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
  
 The Anticoagulation Management Program (AMP) is a Joint Commission
 National Patient Safety Goal initiative to use standardized process for
 the management of their patients on extended anticoagulation therapy.
  
 It runs as a Windows Application from the CPRS Tools menu, and assists 
 Clinicians with the expeditious documentation of visits to Anticoagulation
 Clinics.

     Normalized Ratio) for Prothrombin Times.
                                  
     INR: International normalized ratio, a system established by the World
     Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee on
     Thrombosis and Hemostasis for reporting the results of blood
     coagulation (clotting) tests. All results are standardized using the
     international sensitivity index for the particular thromboplastin
     reagent and instrument combination utilized to perform the test.
                                  
     For example, a person taking the anticoagulant ("blood thinner") 
     warfarin (brand name: Coumadin) might optimally maintain a prothrombin
     time (a "pro time" or PT) of 2 to 3 INR. No matter what laboratory
     checks the prothrombin time, the result should be the same even if
     different thromboplastins and instruments are used. This international
     standardization permits the patient on warfarin to travel and still
     obtain comparable test results.
