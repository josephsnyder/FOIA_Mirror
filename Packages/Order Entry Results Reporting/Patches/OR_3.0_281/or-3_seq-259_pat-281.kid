1. A problem was discovered with the Results Reporting [OR RESULTS
"BLD",7583,1,2,0)
REPORTING] menu after the installation of GMTS*2.7*85. This patch corrects
"BLD",7583,1,3,0)
this problem. HD0000000241916

"BLD",7583,1,5,0)
2. OR*3*243 will add a "Reason for Study" prompt to the Computerized 
"BLD",7583,1,6,0)
Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) "Order an
"BLD",7583,1,7,0)
Imaging Procedure" dialog. The "Reason for Study" requirement was
"BLD",7583,1,8,0)
implemented in the Radiology package with  RA*5.0*75. Existing Radiology
"BLD",7583,1,9,0)
and Imaging quick orders that have text in "History and Reason for Exam"
"BLD",7583,1,10,0)
may need some text moved to "Reason for Study". Since "Reason for Study"
"BLD",7583,1,11,0)
has a size limit of 64 characters changes must be made by a person who can
"BLD",7583,1,12,0)
review what, if any, portion of the text should be moved into the new
"BLD",7583,1,13,0)
field. This patch will allow sites to produce a list of existing quick
"BLD",7583,1,14,0)
orders that should be reviewed. HD0000000217362
"BLD",7583,1,15,0)
 
"BLD",7583,1,16,0)
3. There should no longer be a default of 'TODAY' for "Date Desired" on a 
"BLD",7583,1,17,0)
Radiology quick order. Some sites have requested the ability to
"BLD",7583,1,18,0)
automatically remove 'TODAY' from the "Date Desired" prompt. In addition,
"BLD",7583,1,19,0)
there was a request to be able to exclude quick orders with an order
"BLD",7583,1,20,0)
urgency of 'STAT'. HD0000000232271

   Problem:
"BLD",7583,1,42,0)
   --------
"BLD",7583,1,43,0)
   After a site installed GMTS*2.7*85, they discovered an error would
"BLD",7583,1,44,0)
   occur if they used the Results Reporting Menu [OR RESULTS REPORTING]
"BLD",7583,1,45,0)
   option to display Health Summary results.  It was discovered that the
"BLD",7583,1,46,0)
   variable XQORNOD was being set by the Order Entry Results Reporting
"BLD",7583,1,47,0)
   package incorrectly, with only one piece, and this was causing a
"BLD",7583,1,48,0)
   <SYNTAX>OP+3^XQCHK error to appear.

***Important Notes*** 
"BLD",7583,1,129,0)
If you identify quick orders that need to be updated, you must wait 
"BLD",7583,1,130,0)
until after the installation of OR*3*243 to make these updates. Use the
"BLD",7583,1,131,0)
Enter/edit quick orders [ORCM QUICK ORDERS] option to update the quick 
"BLD",7583,1,132,0)
orders, where appropriate. It may also be necessary for providers to edit
"BLD",7583,1,133,0)
their personal quick orders.
"BLD",7583,1,134,0)
 
"BLD",7583,1,135,0)
Even disabled quick orders will be shown, for review purposes. The results
"BLD",7583,1,136,0)
will be sent as a mail message to the person who ran the option. Please
"BLD",7583,1,137,0)
note, it may be necessary for this menu option to be assigned to the
"BLD",7583,1,138,0)

Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) "Order an
"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)

"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
implemented in the Radiology package with  RA*5.0*75. Existing Radiology
"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
and Imaging quick orders that have text in "History and Reason for Exam"
"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
may need some text moved to "Reason for Study". Since "Reason for Study"
"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
has a size limit of 64 characters changes must be made by a person who can
"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
review what, if any, portion of the text should be moved into the new
"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
field. This patch will allow sites to produce a list of existing quick
"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
orders that should be reviewed. HD0000000217362

"PKG",167,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
automatically remove 'TODAY' from the "Date Desired" prompt. In addition,
