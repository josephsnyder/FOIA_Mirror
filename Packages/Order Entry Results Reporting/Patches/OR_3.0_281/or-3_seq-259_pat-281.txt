Subject: IDENTIFY RADIOLOGY/IMAGING QUICK ORDERS THAT MAY NEED EDITING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 1. A problem was discovered with the Results Reporting [OR RESULTS
 REPORTING] menu after the installation of GMTS*2.7*85. This patch corrects
 this problem.
  
 2. OR*3*243 will add a "Reason for Study" prompt to the Computerized 
 Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) "Order an
 Imaging Procedure" dialog. The "Reason for Study" requirement was
 implemented in the Radiology package with  RA*5.0*75. Existing Radiology
 and Imaging quick orders that have text in "History and Reason for Exam"
 may need some text moved to "Reason for Study". Since "Reason for Study"
 has a size limit of 64 characters changes must be made by a person who can
 review what, if any, portion of the text should be moved into the new
 field. This patch will allow sites to produce a list of existing quick
 orders that should be reviewed. 
  
 3. There should no longer be a default of 'TODAY' for "Date Desired" on a 
 Radiology quick order. Some sites have requested the ability to
 automatically remove 'TODAY' from the "Date Desired" prompt. In addition,
 there was a request to be able to exclude quick orders with an order
 urgency of 'STAT'.

 Overview:
 =========
 1. HD0000000241916 GMTS *85 Problem
  
    Problem:
    --------
    After a site installed GMTS*2.7*85, they discovered an error would
    occur if they used the Results Reporting Menu [OR RESULTS REPORTING]
    option to display Health Summary results.  It was discovered that the
    variable XQORNOD was being set by the Order Entry Results Reporting
    package incorrectly, with only one piece, and this was causing a
    <SYNTAX>OP+3^XQCHK error to appear.

 <SYNTAX>OP+3^XQCHK
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORPRS07 has been modified to properly set two pieces into
    XQORNOD and thus not generate the error when displaying Health Summary
    results when using the Results Reporting Menu [OR RESULTS REPORTING]
    option.
  
 2. HD0000000217362 Need routine to identify potential quick order problems
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Radiology and Imaging quick orders may need to be updated as a result
    of the changes in OR*3*243.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A new option will be provided, Radiology/Imaging Quick Order Search
    [ORCM RA SEARCH]. This option will search for Radiology and Imaging
    quick orders that have free text fields that contain text. A sample
    message and additional details are included below the 'Important 
    Notes' section.
  
 3. HD0000000232271 Need routine to identify Radiology QOs with default
                    date
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Radiology and Imaging quick orders should no longer contain a default
    of TODAY for Date Desired. Sites need assistance in locating and 
    updating the quick orders that need to be updated.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The search option for item 2 includes a search for quick orders that
    contain a default for the Date Desired prompt. In addition,
    the option will remove the Date Desired default values of 'T' 
    or 'TODAY' as requested by the user. A sample message and additional
    details are included below.
  
 ***Important Notes*** 
 If you identify quick orders that need to be updated, you must wait 
 until after the installation of OR*3*243 to make these updates. Use the
 Enter/edit quick orders [ORCM QUICK ORDERS] option to update the quick 
 orders, where appropriate. It may also be necessary for providers to edit
 their personal quick orders.
  
 Even disabled quick orders will be shown, for review purposes. The results
 will be sent as a mail message to the person who ran the option. Please
 note, it may be necessary for this menu option to be assigned to the
 person responsible for the review (i.e. Clinical Coordinator and/or
 Radiology ADPAC).
  
 The following shows a sample message. It is difficult to read since it is 
 formatted to print 132 characters. In the column for "Text or Start 
 Date/Time", there will be a "T" or "D" to indicate "Text" or "Date".
