Subject: UPDATE OE/RR NOTIFICATIONS- IMAGING RESULTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 A site reported their providers were not receiving alerts for all imaging 
 results. There are two alerts, IMAGING RESULTS and ABNORMAL IMAGING 
 RESULTS, that can be triggered when imaging results are complete. They 
 are triggered based on the way the results are coded. In order for 
 providers to receive all imaging results alerts both of these must be
 enabled. 
  
 A comprehensive solution has been requested via New Service Request 
 # 20080616. 
 http://vista.med.va.gov/nsrd/ViewTrackingRecord.asp?RequestID=20080616
  
 In the interim, this patch modifies two alerts in the OE/RR NOTIFICATIONS
 file(#100.9) to clarify the intent of each alert. Both the NAME field
 (#.01)and the MESSAGE TEXT field (#.03) are being changed in the same
 manner. The alerts being modified are IMAGING RESULTS and ABNORMAL 
 IMAGING RESULTS. The Internal Entry Number (IEN) of IMAGING RESULTS
 is 22 and the IEN of ABNORMAL IMAGING RESULTS is 25. Alert 22 is being
 changed from IMAGING RESULTS to IMAGING RESULTS, NON CRITICAL. Alert 
 25 is being changed from ABNORMAL IMAGING RESULTS to ABNL IMAGING 
 RESLT, NEED ATTN.
  
 The change is being made using a post-installation routine. After
 patch install, the person that installed the patch will receive a 
 MailMan message.  Subject line for the mailman message is 
 'OE/RR NOTIFICATIONS ALERT NAME UPDATES'. This mailman message
 is just reminding the installer that they may verify the change to
 file 100.9 (OE/RR NOTIFICATIONS), no other action is required.
  
 The CPRS Technical Manual (cprslmtm.doc and cprslmtm.pdf) have been 
 updated to include the modified text, and to indicate both alert
 22 and 25 should be set as ENABLED. This documentation is 
 available on the Vista Documentation Library.
  
 This patch requires a change in the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine V. 5.0 
 package. RA*5*93 released July 7, 2009 implemented this change.
  
 Please note: the post-install routine, ORY268, will be removed in a 
 future patch (OR*3*284).
  
 ***IMPORTANT NOTE***
 Both 22 - IMAGING RESULTS, NON CRITICAL and 25 - ABNL IMAGING RESLT, 
 NEED ATTN must be enabled in order for users to receive all 
 notifications regarding imaging results.

 Overview:
 =========
  
 1. HD0000000132027 Imaging Results versus Abnormal imaging results
  
    Problem:
    =========
    The Radiology Package currently always sends the following alert 
    notifications to OERR/CPRS, conditioned on the type of result (normal, 
    abnormal, amended - normal or abnormal)
       22 - IMAGING RESULTS (contains normal results)
       25 - ABNORMAL IMAGING RESULTS (contains abnormal results)
       53 - IMAGING RESULTS AMENDED (contains both normal and abnormal)
    Based on the parameter settings, some of these alerts may not display. 
    Due to the text of the alert subject, this may be misleading for the 
    provider.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    The 'imaging results' notification may refer to both normal and 
    abnormal results. The abnormal results are non-critical. The agreement 
    between the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Clinical
    Workgroup and the Radiology subject matter expert is to modify the
    text of alerts 22 and 25 to reduce the confusion. Alert 22 will    
    become 'IMAGING RESULTS NON CRITICAL'. Alert 25 will become 'ABNL
    IMAGING RESLT, NEED ATTN'.
