Subject: BUG FIXES FOR CPRS 27

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 OR*3*303 addresses five issues:
  
 PSPO 1081--Remedy 275556,276825,277713,277840,277585,278089,278936, 
         279408,284201: v 27 d/c
         medication do not display
         Historically the DC order has appeared chronologically at 
         the time the order was DC'd, which is generally at the top
         of the nurse's CPRS order display (reverse chronological 
         active) and can be verified and carried out.  In CPRS GUI 
         v27 users must go to the date/time of the ORIGINAL order 
         and see that the order has been discontinued.  OR*3*303 
         changes this display sequence back to the way it displayed
         in CPRS GUI v26.
  
 Remedy 276435,278376,281309 :  <SUBSCRIPT>GUI+13^ORCDLR2
         Upon install of CPRS GUI 27 the above error was being generated 
         in the error trap.
  
 PSPO 1097--Remedy 276791,277509,277788,278589: Remove CR from 'Reason for 
         Study' field
         CPRS did not strip out carriage returns from the text included 
                 in the new "Reason for Study  field.  This generally 
                 occurs when users copy text and paste it into the "Reason
                 for Study  field.  The consequence of this is that CPRS
                 passes the data to the Radiology application and 
                 Radiology passes the data to PowerScribe which encounters
                 an order processing error.  Resolution to this problem 
                 will be completed in two steps: 1) OR*3*303 and RA*5.0*98
                 will be released as an interim fix.  These patches will 
                 detect the problem and correct the data before storing it;
                 2)  OR*3*296  (CPRS GUI v27.n) will correct the source of
                 the problem by removing any carriage returns from the text
                 entered through CPRS GUI.  The CPRS GUI modification will
                 resolve the problem before the data is stored or passed.
  
 Remedy 276288:  Legacy UD format IVPB orders return "invalid rate" 
         error in CPRS v27 when renewing 
         Users were unable to renew an IVPB order, if the finished 
                 original order was entered with an infusion rate that 
                 was in lower case.  The software has been modified to 
                 convert all entries to upper case.
  
 Patch number 228 was mistakenly left out of the second line patch 
 list in routine ORCSEND in patch OR*3*243.  Thus in your account before
 you install this patch (OR*3*303) you will have the following list on
