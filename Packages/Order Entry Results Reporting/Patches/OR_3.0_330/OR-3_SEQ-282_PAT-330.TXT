Subject: FIX REVIEW/SIGN ORDERS PROBLEM INTRODUCED BY OR*3.0*307

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
 This patch is being issued primarily in response to Patient Safety Alert
 AL10-09 "Anticoagulation Management Software Allows Release of Unsigned
 Orders."
  
 This patch resolves the following problems:
  
 1. After installing Veteran's Health Information Systems and Technology
 (VistA) Anticoagulation Management software (referenced as OR*3*307), a
 problem occurs within the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) in
 which unsigned orders may be inadvertently released by a nurse, based on
 the setting of the 'OR UNSIGNED ORDERS ON EXIT' parameter for that user.
 Prior to exiting the patient's CPRS chart, the system displays the
 patient's verbal/telephone/policy unsigned, unreleased orders and
 unsigned, unreleased orders entered by other users such as medical
 students. The nurse is then unable to uncheck any of the orders and, upon
 entry of their electronic signature code, releases all of the orders
 including those orders not intended for release. Orders entered by a
 medical student and released by a nurse, prior to approval by a physician,
 may result in the patient receiving care not intended to be given by the
 physician. This patch will assure that ORELSE key holders are only shown 
 their own unsigned orders on the Review/Sign Changes dialog, regardless of
 the OR UNSIGNED ON EXIT parameter setting.
  
 2. Additionally, when the nurse (i.e., ORELSE key holder) exits the
 patient's CPRS chart, the system again displays all unsigned orders and
 the nurse is unable to exit the patient's CPRS chart, unless either 'Hold
 Until Signed' is selected or a forced reboot of CPRS is initiated by the
 CTRL-ALT-DEL keyboard sequence. When the nurse re-enters the patient's
 CPRS chart, the orders have been released, but the nurse may not realize
 the orders have been released. The nurse may enter a duplicate
 verbal/telephone/policy order, which may result in an adverse event (e.g.,
 duplicate x-ray). This latter problem is particularly troublesome in
 locations where nurses are routinely required to release verbal orders to
 their respective services.
  
 3. During development of this patch, it was discovered that ORELSE key
 holders would only be presented with the Review/Sign Changes dialog for
 their own INR and CBC orders placed through the Anticoagulation Management
 Tool if they held the PROVIDER key in addition to ORELSE, or if the OR
 UNSIGNED ORDERS ON EXIT parameter was set to ALL UNSIGNED ORDERS. The
 intended functionality is for the ORELSE key holder to be allowed the
 opportunity to release (as verbal/telephone/policy), mark signed on chart,
 or hold until signed any INR or CBC orders which they had placed using the
 Anticoagulation Management Tool, upon returning to CPRS and either
 refreshing patient data, selecting a new patient, or exiting the chart.
  
 4. As noted in Remedy Ticket 394447, notifications for unsigned INR &/or 
 CBC orders placed using the Anticoagulation Management Tool were not 
 being sent, if the user held the ORES key. This has also been corrected.
