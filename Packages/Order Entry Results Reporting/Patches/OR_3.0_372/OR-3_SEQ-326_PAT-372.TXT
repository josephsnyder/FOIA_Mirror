 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000070938 - ORWOR REQUIRE CURRENT CLIENT
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The ORWOR REQUIRE CURRENT CLIENT is a general parameter used prior to
 version 20 of Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) to prevent CPRS GUI users from logging on with previous
 versions of the client GUI after a new version had been installed. CPRS
 GUIv20 added the version check into GUI executable, rendering the
 parameter obsolete. Currently, if the parameter is set to the NO value,
 which should allow ANY GUI version to run, an attempt to login with a
 version other than the installed version is aborted by the check in the
 GUI executable. CPRS no longer uses this parameter.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch deletes the ORWOR REQUIRE CURRENT CLIENT parameter from the
 PARAMETER DEFINITION (#8989.51) file.
  
  
 2. INC000000071104 - Unsched visit alert-discrep bet alert text & descrip
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The current description of the UNSCHEDULED VISIT notification in OE/RR
 NOTIFICATION (#100.9) file begins with this sentence: Triggered when a
 patient is admitted unexpectedly. Most VA personnel associate the term
 "admission" ONLY with an INPATIENT admission. By using the term "visit" in
 the notification name and message text that is displayed to the recipient,
 using "admission" in the description appears to be a discrepancy and could
 cause confusion. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The description has been modified to contain the following text:
     
       Triggered when an unscheduled patient visit occurs. Recipients 
       include attending physician, primary provider and teams. Deletion 
       occurs when each recipient reviews the notification.
   
  
 3. INC0000000312724 - New API needs to be used
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Routine ORWGAPIA directly reads the ^ICD9 and ^ICD0 globals. Direct 
 reads may cause display problems for disease diagnosis when ICD-10 is
 implemented. The routine should be using the new ICD APIs.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ORWGAPIA has been modified to use the appropriate ICD APIs.
 (ICDDX^ICDCODE and ICDOP^ICDCODE)
