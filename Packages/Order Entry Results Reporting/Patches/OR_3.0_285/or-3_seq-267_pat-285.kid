Currently, the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 uses the
"BLD",7667,1,2,0)
GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT file (#120.5) to retrieve vitals information to
"BLD",7667,1,3,0)
display on the Cover Sheet.

"BLD",7667,1,5,0)
The purpose of this patch is to modify the retrieval of vitals 
"BLD",7667,1,6,0)
information to use the Clinical Reminders Index global in conjunction 
"BLD",7667,1,7,0)
with a standard Application Program Interface supplied by the GEN. MED. 
"BLD",7667,1,8,0)
REC. - VITALS V. 5.0 package. No functional changes are included, only the
"BLD",7667,1,9,0)
access method.

"BLD",7667,1,11,0)
A new software package, Clinical Observations, will also collect patient
"BLD",7667,1,12,0)
vital signs but store the records in a different file. However, both GEN.
"BLD",7667,1,13,0)
MED. REC. - VITALS V. 5.0 and the new Clinical Observations package will
"BLD",7667,1,14,0)
update the Clinical Reminders Index global, specifically, the 120.5
"BLD",7667,1,15,0)
section. This patch ensures that vitals information, regardless of its'
"BLD",7667,1,16,0)
source will continue to display appropriately on the CPRS cover sheet.
