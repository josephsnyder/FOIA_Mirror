Subject: UPDATES FOR VITALS INFORMATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Currently, the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 uses the
 GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT file (#120.5) to retrieve vitals information to
 display on the Cover Sheet.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to modify the retrieval of vitals 
 information to use the Clinical Reminders Index global in conjunction 
 with a standard Application Program Interface supplied by the GEN. MED. 
 REC. - VITALS V. 5.0 package. No functional changes are included, only the
 access method.
  
 A new module in the software package, CLINICAL PROCEDURES  - V. 1.0, will
 also collect Patient vital signs, storing the data in OBS file (#704.117).
 The Clinical Reminders Index Global will cross-reference both packages, 
 GEN.MED.REC.   VITALS V. 5.0 for data stored in GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT 
 file (#120.5) and CLINICAL PROCEDURES  - V. 1.0 for data stored in 
 OBS file (#704.117). When CPRS makes the call to retrieve vitals 
 information for display on the CPRS GUI cover sheet all stored data will
 be returned, regardless of the package source.

 Overview:
 =========
 1. HD0000000222625     CPRS Vitals API
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Vitals information displayed on the CPRS coversheet will no 
    longer be retrieved with a direct read of GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT 
    file (#120.5). CPRS must retrieve data using the Clinical Reminders
    Index global.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    CPRS access to retrieve vitals information will now be retrieved using
    the Clinical Reminders Index global and the Application Programming
    Interface (API) provided by the GEN. MED. REC. - VITALS V. 5.0 package.
