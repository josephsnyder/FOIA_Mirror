Description:
============

 Release Method: Monitored Release
 =================================
 CPRS v27.90 (previously known as 27.N) will follow a Monitored Release. A
 Monitored Release consists of releasing software that is closely monitored
 by an Implementation Team to assess impact and limit potential negative
 consequences.  A Monitored Release does not intend to replace or remove
 any of the current testing and release processes, but rather to enhance
 the release phase with additional monitoring for earlier detection of
 issues.  Sites are encouraged to install GUI v27.90 as soon as possible in
 Test environments, aggressively test and then proceed with production
 environment installation.  Sites should have an increased awareness and
 report any problems indentified through Remedy.
  
  
  
 Primary Functionality:
  
 Combat Vet Markers: 
 ===================
     CPRS has new Combat Veteran markers to help users recognize that a 
 veteran has Combat Veteran status. The markers are found on the patient 
 selection screen, on the consult tab, on notifications, order details 
 screen, on the SF-513, and on a button available from any tab. For more 
 details concerning this functionality please see the CPRS GUI v27.90 
 release notes (OR_30_296RN.doc).
  
  
 Mental Health DLL (YS*5.01*98) 
 =======================
     CPRS Support for the New Mental Health DLL - The Mental Health 
 package created a patch to address an issue with temporary files. To 
 avoid confusion with the previous dynamic link library (DLL), the name of 
 the DLL was changed. CPRS made the changes necessary to support the 
 changes to the new DLL, YS_MHA_A.DLL.
  
 Known Issue
 ===========
 Remedy 337505: NCHC--Consult "Reason for Request" Scrollbar 
 Limitation  - Northern California Health Care System reported a problem 
 with the Consult/Procedure dialog, specifically the reason for request 
 field. The reported issue was the scrollbar did not expand properly when 
 text or number of lines filled the reason for request field, resulting in 
 no visibility of text being typed in text field.  This limitation does 
 not exist during the display of the Reason for Request field.
  
 Workaround:
 Option #1; When user comes to the end of the reason for request 
 field and scroll bar does not expand, user can hit enter 2-3 times and 
 scroll bar will be enabled and text will be visible.
 Option #2: For long reason for requests, users may use a word 
 processing tool to write reason for request.  Then, copy and paste test 
 in to the reason for request field.
 Resolution: Developers will correct this issue in CPRS GUI v.28.
  
 Remedy 345650: Personal Quick Orders Don't Save All Values Entered for 
 Some Meds. 
 - Providers noticed that their personal quick orders did not retain the
 saved Quantity value. Instead, the personal quick order defaulted to a 
 Quantity of zero. This issue only occurs with outpatient medications 
 saved as personal quick orders involving medications where the Quantity 
 cannot be calculated (i.e., supply orders, inhalants).
  
 Workaround:  
 When using personal quick orders and the stored quantity value is 
 replaced with the value of zero, the clinician will have to manually 
 update the quantity field to proceed with the order.
 Resolution: Developers will correct this issue in CPRS GUI v. 28.
  
  
 Patient Safety
 ==============
 -       PSPO 1072: Change the Max to 100 for Labs (Remedy 274357) - In 
 CPRS GUI v.27, the maximum number of reports and labs was changed from 
 100 to 10. (This item also listed under Reports.)
 In CPRS v.26, if you asked to view microbiology results on the Labs tab, 
 you viewed ALL results. Now with v.27, the default is 7 days and if you 
 select All results, you see the last 10 reports. The same applies to the 
 reports tab. Those settings can be changed at the Individual Reports 
 level, which with v.27 is now set to a max of 10, whereas with v.26 that 
 max setting was 100. The reports now look the same in both the Labs tab 
 and the Reports tab.
 Resolution: Developers changed the maximum back to 100 for both Labs and 
 Reports tabs.
  
 -       PSPO 1082: IV Orders Were Coming across Differently in Pharmacy 
 Package - Previously, when a user entered "IN" in Infusion Order dialog's 
 Type filed, CPRS correctly displayed "Intermittent", but when a pharmacy 
 user finished the order, the IV defaulted to "Admixture", which was 
 incorrect. 
 Resolution: Developers corrected the problem. Now, when a user enters the 
 "IN", it correctly defaults in the dialog, and when finished in Pharmacy, 
 the IV is a "Piggyback", which is correct.
  
 -       PSPO 1097: Remove CR from "Reason for Study" Field (Remedy 
 276791, 277509, 277788, 278589, 296988) - CPRS did not strip out carriage 
 returns from the text included in the new "Reason for Study" field. This 
 generally occurs when users copy text and paste it into the "Reason for 
 Study" field. The consequence is that CPRS passes the data to the 
 Radiology application and Radiology passes the data to PowerScribe with a 
 carriage return, causing PowerScribe to experience an order processing 
 error.  
 Resolution: This problem will be resolved in two steps: 
 1) OR*3.0*303 and RA*5.0*98 will be released as an interim fix. These 
 patches will detect the problem and correct the data before storing it.
 2) OR*3*296 (CPRS GUI v27.90) will correct the source of the problem by 
 removing any carriage returns from the text entered through the CPRS GUI. 
 The CPRS GUI modification will resolve the problem before the data is 
 stored or passed.
  
 -       PSPO 1209: EDIT/RESUBMIT "New Comments" Stored as One Long String 
 in the GMR(123 Node - Previously, when a user cancelled/denied a consult 
 and added a comment using the Edit/Resubmit button, the comment was 
 stored as a single long comment. Because it was a single long comment, 
 the text displayed inappropriately as a long line that went off the 
 dialog without wrapping. The way it was stored also caused problems with 
 HL7 transmissions.
 Resolution: Developers changed the way the comments were stored. The 
 comment should now wrap appropriately in the display and should not cause 
 problems with HL7 transmissions for Inter-Facility Consults.
  
 -       PSPO 1321: Graphing: Sometimes Lab Test Being Graphed May Not 
 Display Its Most Recent Value (Remedy 288907) - Previously when graphing 
 lab data for a patient and there was data caching, one of the lab tests 
 would not display its most recent value. Data caching occurs only when 
 the user has previously used graphing on a specific patient. Which lab 
 test had its value dropped depended on what collection of lab tests the 
 patient has (based on an internal number for the test). This makes the 
 problem appear sporadic.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem in CPRS. All values should 
 now appear.
  
 -       PSPO 1349: Provider Orders BID Schedule but Gets a Different 
 Admin Time Stored with the Order (Remedy 294361) - If a user typed in a 
 non-unique schedule and pressed the <Enter> key, CPRS allowed the order 
 to be accepted with a non-unique schedule and the wrong administration 
 time. 
 Resolution: Developers made several changes to resolve these issues. 
 1.      Developers changed CPRS to require a unique schedule when leaving 
 the schedule field in the Unit Dose dialog. 
 2.      Developers changes what happens when the user presses the <Enter> 
 key while the focus is still on a drop-down list. Previously, pressing 
 the <Enter> key selected the item and accepted the order, but now 
 pressing the <Enter> key will be the same as pressing the <Tab> key-it 
 will select the item and move to the next field.
 3.      CPRS will also check for a control character in the schedule 
 field when placing an order. If CPRS finds a control character, then it 
 displays an error message to the user and the order cannot be saved until 
 the schedule field is corrected.
  
  
 Defect Fixes 
 ============
  
 BHIE
 ====
 Graphing Not Working Correctly with Department of Defense (DoD) Data - 
 When remote DoD data was being used for graphing, a graph would sometimes 
 display briefly, but it would then disappear.
 Resolution: Developers fixed this problem and CPRS should refresh 
 correctly now.
  
  
 CPRS Splash Screen
 ==================
 508 Email Address on the CPRS Splash Screen - Previously, the
 CPRS splash screen, the one that displays after the user launches CPRS 
 and before the Patient Selection screen appears, had the 508 team's email 
 address. 
 Resolution: CPRS developers replaced the 508 team's email with 
 information on entering a Remedy Ticket if any issues are encountered.
  
 Delayed Orders/Encounter Information
 ====================================
 Adding to Delayed Orders - No Encounter Provider Update Dialog - 
 Previously, if a user who did not have the PROVIDER or ORES key, 
 attempted to add orders to a group of existing orders, CPRS did not 
 prompt the user to define the encounter provider. When the user tried to 
 accept the orders, CPRS displayed the error Unable to Save Order error 
 and did not accept the order.
 Similarly, if a similar type of user tried to enter new delayed orders or 
 tried to add to existing delayed orders, CPRS prompted the user for a 
 provider and a location. The location was not necessary for the delayed 
 orders. 
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to prompt for the encounter provider 
 if needed, but the encounter location is not required for delayed orders. 
 When a user, who is not assigned as the encounter provider and who does 
 not hold the Provider key, is writing new delayed orders or adding to 
 existing delayed orders, CPRS will force the user to select an encounter 
 provider, but CPRS does not force the user to enter an encounter location.
  
 Display Issue (PSPO 1089) Warning
 =================================
 Reference to PSPO 1089 Removed from Warning Message - When the display 
 issue that created this patient safety issue was resolved, the warning 
 message to users included a reference to PSPO 1089. 
 Resolution: Under the direction of the Patient Safety Office, developers 
 removed the reference because it was not necessary. The rest of the text 
 provides the needed information.
  
 Document Searches
 =================
 CPRS Not Highlighting Key Words in a Search - The CPRS search for items 
 in a note or other document was not functioning correctly. The user would 
 search for a term and CPRS would not highlight the item in the text of 
 the note.
 Resolution: CPRS now highlights the searched item in the note text.
  
  
 Encounters
 ==========
 Encounter Form Data from Patient A Displays on Patient B - Previously, 
 new encounter information was carrying over to another patient encounter 
 form incorrectly under the following circumstances:
 -       A provider was entering encounter information, for two patients 
 with the same appointment date/time.
 -       The provider was entering encounter data for an appointment-not 
 editing a note.
 -       No active note was showing on the patient's notes tab.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to prevent the previous patient's 
 encounter data from carrying over to the second patient's chart.
  
 Encounter Location Switching Form
 =================================
 Delayed Orders on Form Cause Access Violation - Previously, delayed 
 orders could display on the encounter location switching form although 
 they were not supposed to display there. The delayed orders caused an 
 access violation. 
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that delayed order no longer 
 display on the Encounter Location switching form.
  
 Graphing
 ========
 Graphing: Sometimes Lab Test Being Graphed May Not Display Its Most 
 Recent Value (PSPO 1321, Remedy 288907) - Previously when graphing lab 
 data for a patient and there was data caching, one of the lab tests would 
 not display its most recent value. Data caching occurs only when the user 
 has previously used graphing on a specific patient. Which lab test had 
 its value dropped depended on what collection of lab tests the patient 
 had (based on an internal number for the test). This makes the problem 
 appear sporadic.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem in CPRS. All values should 
 now appear.
  
 Labs Tab
 ========
 Remote Data Tabs on the Labs Tab Not Displaying - On the Labs tab, CPRS 
 displays some remote data-using a tab for each location. This was not 
 functioning correctly. (This item is duplicated under the heading "Remote 
 Data".)
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem, and the tabs will now 
 display for remote data when appropriate.
  
 -       PSPO 1072: Change the Max to 100 for Labs (Remedy 274357) - In 
 CPRS GUI v.27, the maximum number of reports and labs was changed from 
 100 to 10. 
 Resolution: Developers changed the maximum back to 100.
  
 -       Changing the Value for the Max Number of Labs Does Not Stick 
 (Remedy 274357) - In CPRS GUI v.27, the maximum number of reports and 
 labs was changed from 100 to 10. When users changed the number of labs to 
 a different value, CPRS did not keep the changed value.
 In CPRS v26, if you asked to view microbiology results on the lab tab you 
 viewed ALL results. Now with v.27, the default is 7 days and if you 
 select All results, you see the last 10 reports. The same applies to the 
 reports tab. Those settings can be changed at the Individual Reports, 
 which with v.27 is now set to a max of 10 whereas with v.26 that max 
 setting was 100. The display of the reports now looks the same in both 
 the lab tab and the reports tab.
 Resolution: Developers ensured that the changed value stays.
  
 -       CANNOT FOCUS A DISABLED WINDOW and "Lab Result" Item Selection 
 Missing (Remedy 274661) - There are some reports on the Labs tab that do 
 not retrieve remote data, only local data  These include Selected Tests 
 By Date, Worksheet and Graph. These reports were incorrectly being evoked 
 when the user added or subtracted remote sites from on the Remote site 
 list, and sometimes CPRS displayed the error "Cannot Focus on a disabled 
 window".
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 -       Most Recent Labs Data Disappearing - When a user brought up the 
 Labs tab with the Most Recent Labs option, the data displayed correctly. 
 If, however, the user tried another option, such as "Selected Test by 
 Date", but before the data was displayed, the user canceled, the 
 appropriate data from the Most Recent Labs option did not display. The 
 user could see older results, but not the most recent. 
 Resolution: This problem occurred when a user cancelled out of a test 
 selection screen on the Selected Tests report because the previous report 
 was activated but not reselected. Developers changed CPRS to reselect the 
 report, thus repopulating the report screen with the correct data.
  
 Medication Quick Orders
 =======================
 Typos in Report from MED QUICK ORDERS W/ ANCESTORS 
 Resolution: Developers corrected the errors in the text.
  
 -       OR MEDICATION QO CHECKER--Report w/o Ancestors Is Empty (Remedy 
 273607, 273794) - There was some confusion over use of the term 
 "ancestor" in this report. It was used in different ways in this report 
 and with another option, ORCM SEARCH/REPLACE.
 Resolution: The description of this option was rewritten to better define 
 what the report shows.
  
 -       Quick Order Prompt (Auto-accept this order?) Is Appearing 
 Erratically - Previously, the quick order editor displayed the prompt 
 "Auto-accept this order?" erratically. 
 Resolution: For IV medication quick orders, CPRS now checks whether the 
 auto-accept prompt should display based on whether the quick order 
 provides all the information to complete the order. If the user creating 
 or editing the quick order has defined all the necessary information, 
 then the quick order editor displays the auto-accept prompt. If the quick 
 order will need additional user interaction, the quick order cannot be 
 auto-accepted and the prompt will not display.
  
 -       VistA Quick Orders Do Not Allow Fractional Number for Infusion 
 Rate of Continuous Infusion Orders - Previously, CPRS did not allow the 
 user creating a VistA quick order to enter a fractional infusion rate 
 (such as 5.5) for continuous IV quick orders. 
 Resolution: Developers changed VistA quick orders to accept a fractional 
 amount for an infusion rate.
  
 Notifications
 =============
 Problem with Removing a Notifications Surrogate (Remedy 266981) -
 When the user selected Tools | Options and then the Notifications tab, 
 CPRS was not removing the surrogate when the user selected 
 Remove Surrogate.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem and CPRS will now 
 remove the surrogate appropriately.
  
 Orders
 ======
 -       <UNDEFINED>INF+6^ORCDPSIV (Remedy 274902) - Previously, if the 
 user entered text into the Infusion dialog's Infuse Over Time field, CPRS 
 would show the error <UNDEFINED>INF+6^ORCDPSIV. 
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the Infuse Over Time field 
 only accepts numbers.
  
 -       Type "IN" for IV Type (Infusion Dialog), Order Is Filed as 
 Continuous - Previously, if a user was trying to select the IV Type of 
 Intermittent and the user typed "IN", CPRS selected the Continuous type 
 instead of the Intermittent type.
 Resolution: Developers corrected CPRS to select the appropriate item when 
 the user types the letters.
  
  
 -       When Entering an Intermittent Infusion Order with Schedule Type 
 Prompt, OTHER, No Scheduling Box Is Displayed (Remedy 273911) - 
 Previously, if the user entered an Intermittent IV type order, and typed 
 "other" or some variant, the Day of Week Schedule Builder did not 
 display. It worked correctly if the user selected other using the mouse.
 Resolution: Developers corrected CPRS and users can either type the 
 letters or use the mouse to select "Other".
  
 -       When an Intermittent IV QO Does Not Have "Infuse Over Time" 
 Defined, but Is Set-Up to Be Verified, the Verify Order 
 (Accept/Edit/Cancel) Form Does NOT Display - If a user selected a quick 
 order for an intermittent IV, and the quick order is set to have the user 
 verify the order, the Verify Order (Accept/Edit/Cancel) form does not 
 display as it should. The form should display and give the user the 
 chance to edit or not, but CPRS incorrectly put the user directly into 
 the dialog to edit the order.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem, and the Verify Order form 
 displays so that the user can choose what to do.
  
 -       Infusion Order Dialog: Typing in OTHER in Schedule Box, Select 
 OTHER Using Arrow Keys, Drop Down Box Remains On Screen - Previously, if 
 the user typed in the first few letters of the word "other" in the 
 Schedule field and then used the arrow keys to select OTHER, the display 
 was not updated correctly. Part of the drop-down box remained displayed 
 on the dialog and covered some of the times so that the user could not 
 select them. 
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem: The dialog will now behave 
 appropriately.
  
 -       Launch the DOW Schedule Builder by Typing OTHER, the Admin Time 
 Is Not Updated - Previously, if the user launched the Day-of Week 
 schedule builder by typing "other", the administration time was not 
 updated. If the user entered other by selecting it with the mouse, the 
 administration time was updated. 
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem and the administration time 
 will update appropriately.
  
 -       If an Intermittent QO Has an Additive with a Strength and/or a 
 Solution, It Should Auto-Accept (Remedy 275722) - With the changes for 
 CPRS GUI v.27, users could enter an infusion order for an additive with a 
 strength or a solution, whereas prior to v.27, the additive would have 
 required a solution. This scenario worked correctly if the user entered 
 the order through the dialog, but if a quick order was created with the 
 same characteristics, it would not auto-accept.
 Resolution: Developers made changes so that the order can now be set to 
 auto-accept.
  
  
 -       Infusion QO Retains Fields when Switching IV Types in the VistA 
 Quick Order Editor - Previously, if a user was creating IV orders in the 
 quick order editor and entered values in the Schedule, Infuse over time, 
 or Infusion rate field and then changed IV types (from Intermittent to 
 Continuous or from Continuous to Intermittent), CPRS should have removed 
 the values when the type changed, but the values inappropriately 
 remained.  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem, and changing from one IV 
 Type to another clears the appropriate fields.
  
 -       OR MEDICATION QO CHECKER Lacks a Description of the Option 
 Functionality and a Prompt to Proceed - When using the OR MEDICATION QO 
 CHECKER, there was no description of the option telling the user what 
 would happen if the user ran the option. The field also asked that a 
 prompt be provided so that the user could decide if they wanted to 
 proceed.
 Resolution: Developers changed this option to include the prompt and the 
 following description:
 The option generates two reports (printed to an e-mail message sent to 
 the originator of the report) of Quick Orders that should be evaluated 
 due to the addition of three new fields in CPRS 27:  Route, IV Type and 
 Schedule.  One report includes QOs that are contained in an order menu, 
 order set or a reminder dialog.  The other report includes QOs that are 
 stand alone and not included in another entry.
  
 -       Convert IV Inpatient QO to Infusion QO Has a Typo - There was a 
 typographical error in the text for the conversion utility. The word 
 "move" should have been "moved".
 Resolution: Developers corrected the spelling error.
  
 -       Intermittent QO Created without Schedule and Set for Auto-Accept 
 Results in Released Order without a Schedule - Previously, if sites 
 created an Intermittent IV quick order without a schedule and set the 
 order to be an auto-accept order, CPRS did not display the dialog to 
 require a schedule. The order could therefore be placed while missing the 
 schedule.
 Resolution: CPRS should now catch the problem, display the dialog, and 
 require the user to enter a schedule.
  
 -       When Adding to Delayed Orders, Non-Provider Key Holders Prompted 
 for a Provider and a Location - Previously, when a nurse was adding to 
 existing delayed orders or entering new delayed orders, the nurse had to 
 select both a location and a provider. This was confusing because the 
 location was unnecessary and could cause the orders to print at a 
 location that was not ready to receive the patient. 
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS. Now, when a nurse is writing new 
 delayed orders or adding to existing delayed orders, CPRS requires the 
 nurse to select a provider, but the nurse will not be required to select 
 a location. 
  
 -       Quick Order Editor Inappropriately Moves Data between Fields when 
 Switching IV Types - In the Infusion Order dialog when the user changed 
 the IV Type either from continuous to intermittent or from intermittent 
 to continuous, the Schedule field and the Infusion Rate/Infuse over Time 
 field were being carried over. 
 Resolution: When switching the IV Type either from continuous to 
 intermittent or from intermittent to continuous, both the Schedule field 
 and the Infusion Rate/Infuse over Time field will be blanked out.
  
 -       Schedule Functionality different between Infusion Order Dialog 
 and Medication Order Dialog - Previously, on the Inpatient Medication 
 order dialog, if the user entered a free-text schedule, CPRS would 
 auto-match even if the letters entered did not uniquely identify a 
 schedule.
 Resolution: Developers changed the Inpatient Medication order dialog's 
 Schedule field will not auto-match unless enough characters have been 
 entered to uniquely identify a schedule.
  
 -       <Enter Key> Will Not Default to Activate the Accept Button on IV, 
 Outpatient, Unit Dose, and Non-VA Meds Dialogs - Previously, if on the 
 IV, Outpatient, Unit Dose, and Non-VA Meds dialogs, the user pressed the 
 Enter key, it was the same as selecting the item that had focus and 
 pressing the Accept button. The order might be accepted with 
 unintentional or inaccurate items selected. 
 Resolution: Developers changed these dialogs so that the Enter key will 
 work as it does on other order dialogs. If in a drop-down box, for 
 example, pressing the Enter key will activate the selected item and move 
 to the next control (drop-down, text field, etc.) and will not accept the 
 order. The user will need to explicitly click the Accept button or tab to 
 it and then press Enter in order to accept the order.
  
 -       Prevent Display of Admin Times for PRN Schedules - When a user 
 opens an inpatient medication quick order (QO) with a PRN schedule 
 defined in the administration file, file #51.1, and if the site had 
 defined administration times for the PRN schedule, the administration 
 times would display when the QO was opened in CPRS. The administration 
 times should not display for a PRN schedule.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that administration times for a 
 PRN schedule do not display-even if the schedule has administration times 
 defined.
  
 -       Changed Order Display Includes a Schedule of PRN and a Check in 
 the PRN Checkbox, Plus PRN Only Schedule for Inpt. Med Displays "Expected 
 First Dose" - Previously, when a user changed a PRN order that only had 
 the PRN checkbox checked in the initial order, the order dialog would 
 display with PRN in the schedule field and the PRN checkbox would be 
 checked. Also, if the user unchecked the PRN checkbox and if a PRN 
 schedule was not set-up in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file, file #51.1, 
 the Expected First Dose value would still display in the order dialog 
 incorrectly.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to only check the PRN checkbox for a 
 changed order in the above scenario if a PRN schedule is not defined. 
 This change also fixes the problem with the Expected First Dose value 
 appearing incorrectly.
  
 -       CPRS Does Not Allow First Action on Change Orders, Copy Orders, 
 or Quick Orders - In CPRS v.27, when the user selected any action that 
 loaded previously defined order data, such as quick orders, transfer 
 orders, change orders, or copy orders, CPRS did not correctly adjust the 
 Quantity field in outpatient order dialog for the first change that a 
 user would make. For example, if a user selected an order and selected 
 the Change action, and then subsequently changed the free-text schedule 
 to a defined schedule (such as BID), the quantity field would 
 recalculate. But if the user then changed back to the free-text schedule, 
 the quantity field would keep the same quantity as when the BID schedule 
 was there. Another example would be if the user selected Change order and 
 then changed the Days Supply value, the quantity field would not adjust.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to recognize the first action 
 correctly so that the quantity field will calculate, as it should. In the 
 above scenario, CPRS will readjust the quantity to zero if the user has 
 not done a manual correction to the quantity value. If the user does 
 manually change the Quantity value and then makes any adjustment to the 
 schedule, the Days Supply value should update and not the quantity value. 
 This returns to the functionality that existed in CPRS GUI v.26.
  
 -       Backspace Issue: Modify Patient Selection and Med Dialogs to 
 Prevent Retention of Previously Selected Entry - Previously, if the user 
 selected a value in a medication order dialog or the patient selection 
 dialog drop-down list, highlighted the selected value at the top of the 
 drop-down list, and pressed the <Backspace> key, the text would be 
 deleted from the drop-down list. However, the drop-down list would 
 maintain the deleted value as the selected value. This could have caused 
 a problem if the user pressed the <Enter> key right after deleting the 
 text.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the drop-down list does not 
 maintain the value when the user pressed the <Backspace> key for the 
 Patient Selection screen and the Medication Order dialog.
  
  
 -       Pressing <Enter> Key Too Rapidly Can Save Orders without 
 Appropriate Information or with Inaccurate Information
         -       Can Enter Order with Missing or Invalid Schedule - If the 
 user does the following, CPRS could possibly save an order with no 
 schedule or control character in the Schedule field.
 a)      Launch the Inpatient Medications order dialog. 
 b)      Select the Complex tab. 
 c)      In lower case (this must be lower case), type the first few 
 characters of a schedule such as BID -choose a schedule for which the 
 first few characters are NOT unique (i.e., BID is not enough to unique 
 match between BID and BID AC). Or, type in an invalid schedule. 
 d)      Without leaving the Schedule field, press CTRL+ENTER to activate 
 the default button on the form (Accept Order). 
 The order saves without a schedule. If you entered an invalid schedule, 
 CPRS displays several error dialogs: first, CPRS displays the invalid 
 schedule dialog, and then two "Cannot focus on a disabled or invisible 
 window" messages.
  
         -       Inpatient Med with Incorrect Admin Time, via Complex Tab 
 - If the user does the following, the user can save an order with the 
 wrong administration time.
 a)      Launch the Inpatient Medications order dialog. 
 b)      Switch to the Complex tab. 
 c)      In lower case (this must be lower case), type the first few 
 characters of a schedule such as BID -choose a schedule for which the 
 first few characters are NOT unique (i.e., BID is not enough to unique 
 match between BID and BID AC) .
 d)      While still in the Schedule field, click the X (Close button) in 
 the upper right corner.
  
         -       Can Change Some Outpatient Medication Fields and Save the 
 Order before Other Fields Auto-Update - For an Outpatient Medication 
 order, if a user was editing an item in a drop-down list and pressed the 
 <Enter> key, CPRS could possibly save the order with the wrong Days 
 Supply and Quantity values because the fields did not have a chance to 
 update.
  
         -       Provider Orders BID Schedule but Gets a Different Admin 
 Time Stored with the Order (PSPO 1349, Remedy 294361) - If a user typed 
 in a non-unique schedule and pressed the <Enter> key, CPRS allowed the 
 order to be accepted with a non-unique schedule and the wrong 
 administration time. 
  
         -       Modify UD, OPT Meds, and Non-VA Meds Dialogs to Prevent 
 Saving of Order when Editing Dosage, Route, Schedule and Pressing the 
 <Enter> Key - If the user presses the <Enter> key while they are in a 
 drop-down list in the Dosage tab of the Unit Dose, Outpatient 
 Medications, or Non-VA Meds dialog, CPRS would save an order.
  
  
 Resolution: Developers made several changes to resolve these issues. 
 1.      Developers changed CPRS to require a unique schedule when leaving 
 the schedule field in the Unit Dose dialog. 
 2.      Developers changes what happens when the user presses the <Enter> 
 key while the focus is still on a drop-down list. Previously, pressing 
 the <Enter> key selected the item and accepted the order, but now 
 pressing the <Enter> key will be the same as pressing the <Tab> key-it 
 will select the item and move to the next field.
 3.      CPRS will also check for a control character in the schedule 
 field when placing an order. If CPRS finds a control character, then it 
 displays an error message to the user and the order cannot be saved until 
 the schedule field is corrected.
  
 -       NF Alternative Med Highlighted and Accepted, CPRS Does Not Go to 
 the Alternative (Remedy 297310) - This problem occurred when the user 
 types in the medication name-not using the mouse. In the order dialog, if 
 the user types the name of a medication with a formulary alternative, 
 CPRS displays a dialog with the formulary alternative. If the user 
 selects the formulary alternative, the order dialog displayed with the 
 original medication name at the top, but the correct medication in the 
 order sig at the bottom of the order dialog.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
  
 Problem List
 ============
 -       Pass a Null Value to Problem List for Edited Problem List Entries 
 with a PRIORITY of UKNOWN-Entered via Problems Tab - A problem was 
 introduced with OR*3.0*243 that allowed a null value, which should not 
 have been allowed, to be passed to the Problem List package when a user 
 entered a problem with a priority of UNKNOWN on the Problems tab. This 
 null value caused some reminders to not be displayed that would be 
 related to the problem
 Resolution: Two patches fixed this error: GMPL*2.0*37 and this patch, 
 OR*3.0*296. The first patch went through and corrected null entries that 
 were in the sites' databases. The patch for CPRS GUI v.27.90 (OR*3.0*296)
 prevents the null value from being set or passed to the Problem List 
 package.
  
 -       New Problems with Priority of Unknown Creates Bad Data - In CPRS 
 v.27, a change was made that created an error: If a user entered a new 
 problem and left the priority as "unknown", CPRS sent incorrect data to 
 the problem list application. The Reminders Index then used the Problem 
 List as a source, and the bad data meant that some reminders were not 
 correctly evaluated.
 Resolution: Developer corrected the problem list so that it now sends the 
 correct data. A separate Problem List patch will correct the incorrect 
 data.
  
 Reminders
 =========
 -       Remote Procedure ORWCV POLL is not registered to the option 
 YSBROKER1 (Remedy 276139)  
 - In CPRS v.27, when processing a Mental Health test from a 
 Clinical Reminder dialog, the following error occurs sporadically:
 "Remote Procedure ORWCV POLL is not registered to the option YS BROKER1."
 Resolution: OWCV POLL RPC is a background job that CPRS checks every 
 couple of seconds for the cover sheet data. This error occurs if a Mental 
 Health test is accessed while this background job is processing. 
 Developers modified CPRS to pause in checking the OWCV POLL job while the 
 Mental Health DLL is open.
  
 -       Reminders Due Folder Displays, but Contains No Due Reminders - 
 Sites discovered a problem with the Reminders evaluation that conflicted 
 with use of the Vitals dynamic link library (DLL) in CPRS. When a user 
 opens a patient record in CPRS, several processes occur, including a 
 Reminders evaluation to see if any Reminders are due for the selected 
 patient. While this is happening, the Reminders icon shows the magnifying 
 glass going in circles. 
 The conflict occurred when the user opened the Vitals DLL while the 
 Reminders evaluation was occurring. When the Vitals DLL is launched, CPRS 
 gave control over to the DLL. When the DLL closed, it gave control back 
 to CPRS, but the Reminders evaluation did not complete, so no Reminders 
 were shown as due.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to begin the Reminders evaluation 
 again if it is not complete.
  
 Remote Data
 ===========
 -       Remote Data Tabs on the Labs Tab Not Displaying - On the Labs 
 tab, CPRS displays some remote data using tab for each location. This was 
 not functioning correctly. (This item is duplicated under the heading 
 "Labs Tab".)
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem, and the tabs will now 
 display for remote data when appropriate.
  
 -       Second Button Appears for Patients with More Than One Selection 
 under Remote Data View (Remedy 276181) - When a user was using Remote 
 Data Views that showed data on different tabs for different sites, CPRS 
 was displaying two tabs for sites instead on one.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this, and on one tab will display for 
 remote sites, as it should.
  
 -       Inconsistent HDR Report Messages - The message that CPRS displays 
 when the parameter to use the Health Data Repository (HDR) is set to YES 
 reads: "You must use VistaWeb to view this report." When the parameter is 
 set to NO, the message reads: "The HDR is currently inactive. Unable to 
 retrieve HDR data at this time." It does not mention to use VistaWeb to 
 view this data, which was inconsistent and confusing.
 Resolution: Developers changed the message logic/text to make more 
 sense.  CPRS will not display the message if HDR is turned on.
  
 -       HDR Report Data Is Retrieved Contrary to Message - Previously, if 
 a user selected an HDR Report, CPRS displayed a message that the user 
 "must use VistaWeb" to view the report, but after a short time, CPRS did 
 display the data.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the "view VistaWeb" message 
 only pops up when the HDR parameter is turned off.
  
 -       HDR Site Cannot Be Unchecked while HDR Report Is Selected - 
 Previously, when a user selected an HDR report and then tried to uncheck 
 the HDR item, CPRS displayed a message about viewing the report using 
 VistaWeb and the HDR item would be rechecked.  To uncheck HDR, the user 
 had to select a non-HDR report.
 Resolution: Developers disabled the automatic rechecking of the HDR site 
 disabled.
  
 -       HDR Included in All Available Sites Option Even when Turned Off - 
 When a user selected an HDR report and the HDR was not available in CPRS, 
 CPRS displayed the message: "The HDR is currently inactive. Unable to 
 retrieve HDR data at this time." Then, if the user checked or unchecked 
 All Available Sites, CPRS displayed this message again. (It did not 
 matter which tab the user was on when the user checked or unchecked All 
 Available Sites as long as an HDR report was selected on the Reports 
 Tab-CPRS still displayed the message.) This behavior seems to indicate 
 the HDR site is being checked/unchecked with the All Available Sites 
 option, even though it does not appear on the list.
 Resolution: The text of the message has been changed to be more clear: 
 "The HDR is currently inactive in CPRS. You must use VistaWeb to view 
 this report."  Also, the message should only appear when the user is on 
 the Reports tab.
  
 -       Remote Data Showing Multiple Tabs (Remedy 282075, 276181) - In 
 CPRS, if you accessed Remote Data on the Reports tab and selected 
 multiple hospitals, CPRS displays two tabs with the same data for some 
 hospitals.
 Resolution: CPRS should display only one tab per remote location.
  
 -       RDV: Incorrect Lab Status Report Displayed for Remote Site - 
 Previously, when a user selected the Lab Status report for the local site 
 and a remote site, CPRS displayed the correct Lab Status report for the 
 local site, but the data for the remote site was the Daily Order Summary.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this error and the correct report now 
 displays.
  
 Reports
 =======
 -       Imaging and Microbiology Reports (Remedy 275884) - A problem was 
 occurring when users went to the Labs and Reports tab and viewed some 
 data and then switched to the other tab. Some reports were not showing 
 data. The two tabs were using the same object, which caused conflicts and 
 display problems.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to prevent the problems.
  
 -       PSPO 1072: Change the Max to 100 for Reports (Remedy 274357) - In 
 CPRS GUI v.27, the maximum number of reports and labs was changed from 
 100 to 10. 
 Resolution: Developers changed the maximum back to 100.
  
 Template Editor
 ===============
 -       Trouble Selecting Correct Consult in Template Editor - In CPRS 
 GUI v.27, CPRS introduced a problem: typing a few characters of a name in 
 the template editor did not select the right consult. 
 Resolution: CPRS now allows the user to type in characters to select the 
 appropriate consult as it did before v.27.
  
  
 VBECS (Blood Bank)
 ==================
 Note:   CPRS users will not see the VBECS dialog and related changes 
 until the VBECS product and associated patches are installed at your 
 site. However, these changes are in CPRS and so they are documented here.
  
 -       "Lab Results Available" Label Sometimes Misleading - In the Blood 
 Components and Diagnostic Test Orders dialog, one of the tabs is labeled 
 "Lab Results". However, when data is available the tab name changes to 
 "Lab Results Available". The label on the tab was displaying incorrectly 
 at times when there was no data.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem and the tab should be 
 labeled "Lab Results Available" only when there is some data.
  
 -       CPRS Allows Free Text in Blood Component Field
 Resolution: CPRS no longer allows free-text in that field. Users must 
 choose a selection from the list.
  
 -       Urgency Defaults to PRE-OP when Selecting Diagnostic Test
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to correctly retrieve and send the 
 Urgency. This change requires both OR*3.0*296 and OR*3.0*212, which 
 activates the VBECS dialog in CPRS.
  
 -       CPRS HL7 Message Missing Urgency - A problem occurred in the HL7 
 messaging from CPRS to VBECS that did not send the urgency. As a result, 
 VBECS did not receive the order for ABO/Rh.
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 -       CPRS Inappropriately Displays "Duplicate Order" Warning - When a 
 user would try to change a VBECS order, CPRS displayed the warning that 
 it was a duplicate order. 
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 -       CPRS Remote Data to Look Up Blood Bank Report Requires Selecting 
 "All Available Sites" - Previously, if the user was trying to get remote 
 data from the Blood Bank report, the user had to select "All Available 
 Sites".
 Resolution: Developers corrected CPRS so that the user can select only 
 those sites from which the user wants to view data.
  
 -       Warning for Duplicate Type and Screen with Quick Orders - When a 
 patient already had a Type and Screen done within the allowed period for 
 the site (the default is 3 days), and a user placed a quick order for a 
 Type and Screen, the user was not informed that the patient already had a 
 valid Type and Screen.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that if the patient has a Type and 
 Screen done within a specified number of days, the user will get a 
 warning that the patient has a valid Type and Screen. The user can still 
 order a type and screen. Your clinical coordinator can define the number 
 of days for a valid Type and Screen in a parameter.
  
 -       CPRS Mistakenly Says a Test Was Not Ordered  - Previously, when a 
 user entered the Blood Components and Diagnostic Test Orders dialog, and 
 first ordered a test and then ordered a blood component, CPRS would 
 display a warning that a Type and Screen was required, but it had really 
 been ordered.
 Resolution: CPRS developers corrected this problem and the warning should 
 display appropriately.
  
 -       Error Received when Choosing Type and Screen First on an Order - 
 When trying to place a blood component order, if the user first selected 
 a Type and Screen and then selected a blood component, CPRS displayed 
 messages saying that the test was needed. Although the test was already 
 selected, CPRS acted as if there was no Type and Screen ordered. 
 Resolution: CPRS now accepts and correctly processes the tests and blood 
 products regardless of which is ordered first.
  
 -       VBECS Order Dialog Cursor Flashing, Stuck on Empty Diagnostic Box 
 - With a specific series of steps, it was possible that CPRS put the 
 focus in the wrong component, causing the cursor to flash and not 
 function properly. To solve the problem, the user must use Windows Task 
 Manager (Ctrl + Alt + Delete and then Task Manager) to shut down CPRS.
 Resolution: Developer changed CPRS so the flashing cursor no longer 
 occurs.
  
 -       VBECS Collection Type for CPRS-VBECS Orders Behave Differently 
 than for Lab Orders (Remedy 296245)
 Resolution: Developers corrected the disparity between the Collection 
 Type in the CPRS-VBECS orders and lab orders. They should now be 
 consistent.
  
 -       VBECS Component Is Defaulting to an Urgency of Routine in the 
 Blood Components and Diagnostic Test Orders Dialog - Previously, the 
 urgency functionality in the Blood Components and Diagnostic Test Orders 
 dialog was behaving differently than found in the Lab Order dialog.
 Resolution: Developers corrected the disparity between the Urgency in the 
 CPRS-VBECS orders and lab orders. They should now be consistent.
  
 -       VBECS Quick Order for "RBC Only" Does Not Require T&S even When 
 There Is No Specimen in Lab - Previously, if the user placed a quick 
 order for red blood cells and the Type and Screen test was not included 
 in the order, CPRS did not prompt the user to order one when it should 
 have. If the patient did not have a valid specimen in the lab, CPRS 
 should have prompted the user that a Type and Screen was required. The 
 order could therefore be sent to VBECS without the required test.
 Resolution: CPRS should now prompt for Type and Screen test when one is 
 required.
  
 -       VBECS Reason for Request  Should Expand Long Reason when Cursor 
 Hovers over Selection - Sites requested that when the cursor hovers over 
 long reasons for request (those that expand beyond the boundaries of the 
 visible field) in the Blood Component and Diagnostic Test Order Form that 
 the hover hint shows the entire reason for request.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that hovering the cursor over a 
 long reason for request will show the entire reason. 
  
 -       VBECS: CPRS Auto-Accept Allows Blood Components to be Ordered 
 without a T&S for a QO - Because CPRS VBECS quick orders could be set as 
 auto-accept, it was possible for CPRS to bypass the checks that required 
 a Type and Screen to be ordered with specified blood components.
 Resolution: To prevent this problem and others from occurring, CPRS 
 disabled auto-accept for CPRS VBECS quick orders. For CPRS VBECS quick 
 orders, the dialog will display and users must accept the order from the 
 dialog. This will ensure that appropriate checks take place.
  
 -       VBECS Quick Orders on Selection Should Open to the Order Dialog 
 (Middle Tab) - Previously, CPRS VBECS quick orders caused the Blood 
 Components and Diagnostic Tests Order Form, which has three tabs, to open 
 to the first tab, the Patient Information tab. Test sites requested that 
 the form should instead open to the second tab, the Blood Bank Orders tab 
 where providers would see the information from the quick order.
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that when a quick order is 
 selected, CPRS will open to the second tab, the Blood Bank Orders tab.
  
 Vitals Lite
 ===========
 -       User Kicked Out of CPRS when Vitals Lite Opened (Remedy 287515, 
 287532, 287536, 287764, 287766, 288230) - Previously, when a user had 
 logged in to CPRS and while the Cover Sheet was loading, the user 
 launched the Vitals Lite application and entered vitals. Then, the user 
 closed Vitals Lite, later reopened it, and closed it again. At that 
 point, CPRS inappropriately closed. One user even reported that when she 
 opened the chart after it closed, CPRS displayed a different patient's 
 chart.
 Resolution: Developers found that the problem seemed to be when users 
 double-clicked when launching Vitals Lite. Developers corrected the 
 problem and a double-click will no longer cause this problem.
