Associated patches: (v)OR*3*380    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*383'

Subject: COMPLEX TRANSFER FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Problem:
 When transferring a complex medication order from Outpatient to Inpatient,
 if one of the components of the complex order has a free text dosage then
 upon transfer it is blanked out by the system.  The order dialog displays
 with one of the component dosages blank and allows the user to place the 
 order as such resulting in a somewhat corrupted order upon finishing in 
 backdoor.
  
 Solution:
 OR*3*383 will fix this issue by not performing the logic to clear the 
 dosage on any orders that are complex orders.
  
  
 **********IMPORTANT NOTICE**********
  
 1. The Pre/Post Installation Review section contains a list of sites that 
 should NOT install OR*3*383 until explicitly told to do so.
  
 2. If your site is not exempted from installation, you should install 
 OR*3*383 within 2 days of national release.
