Subject: CPRS-VBECS interface

Category:

  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch implements a new interface between the Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS) and the VistA Blood Enhancement Computer System 
 (VBECS).  New order dialogs, orderable items, and display groups will be 
 installed to support ordering blood components and diagnostic tests.  
 CPRS v27 and VBECS are both required to be present on the target system 
 before installation of this patch will be allowed.
  
 The installation of OR*3*212 will be controlled by phased-release to 
 support VBECS.  An Implementation Manager will be assigned to your site, 
 who will contact your POC for VBECS and provide your site with the 
 location of the KIDS Host Files prior to your scheduled installation date.
  
 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES:
 ======================
 PSPO 1063: Orders can be placed in CPRS for VBECS when links are down
 (Remedy #268782) - When the VistaLink connection between VBECS and CPRS 
 is interrupted, the user is presented with an error message after CPRS 
 attempts to retrieve existing patient blood bank data for presentation in 
 the VBECS order dialog box.  The text of this message implied that the 
 order would not be able to be released to VBECS at that time, yet the 
 user is allowed to continue and place the blood product order.
  
 Resolution: A parameter, OR VBECS ERROR MESSAGE, has been created to 
 allow each site to define the text to be displayed in the event of a 
 VistaLink disconnection; this may include specific directions or even 
 local blood bank or IRM phone numbers, as desired.  VistaLink is not the 
 mechanism used to release the order, and thus a problem with it does not 
 in fact imply that the order cannot be released; the default text 
 exported with this parameter reflects this.

 INSTALLATION SEQUENCE:
 ======================
 The files listed below represent the patches that have either been 
 released or will be part of the controlled phased release.  The first 
 patch has been released and should already be installed; patches starting 
 with number 2 will need to follow the sequence listed below when your 
 phased installation occurs.
  
 1.      LR*5.2*387
 2.      LR*5.2*335
 3.      LR*5.2*367
 4.      VBECS Bundle (consisting of VBECS 1.0 and LR*5.2*325)
 5.      VBEC*1.0*1
 6.      OR*3.0*212
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 Although this is a controlled phased release, the user and technical 
 documentation will be available to all sites when the patch is officially 
 released and the phased implementations start.  This will allow sites the 
 opportunity to retrieve the documents before their phased installation 
 date.
  
 Documentation is available on the Office of Information Field Office 
 (OIFO) ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories listed below:

 This file will be made available by the Implementation Manager prior to 
 your site's implementation schedule along with instructions to retrieve.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 The installation of OR*3*212 and VBECS and its related patches are being 
 handled as a controlled release. The implementation manager will contact 
 you with the location of the OR_3_212.KID host file prior to your 
 scheduled installation date.
  
 Users may be on the system during installation of this patch, though this
 patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to
 users.  Installation will take less than 1 minute.
  
 1.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 2.  Use Load a Distribution using OR_30_212.KID when prompted to Enter
     a Host File name.  You may need to prepend a directory name.
  
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*212):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package OR*3.0*212.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? YES//', respond YES.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
     you may respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
 8.  When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
  
 9.  After installation has completed, follow the instructions in the 'Set
     Up VBECS Logical Links' section on page 25 of the "VBECS Application
     Interfacing Support Software Installation and User Configuration 
     Guide" to configure the OERR-VBECS HL Logical Link.
