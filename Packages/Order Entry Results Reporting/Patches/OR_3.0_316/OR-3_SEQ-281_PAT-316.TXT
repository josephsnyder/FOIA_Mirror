Subject: GLUCOPHAGE  ORDER CHECK PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) order checks GLUCOPHAGE -
 CONTRAST MEDIA and GLUCOPHAGE - LAB RESULTS are not triggered when the
 medication order for Metformin contains lower case letters in the drug
 name.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000339814 - Glucophage Contrast Media Order Check not triggered.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    GLUCOPHAGE - CONTRAST MEDIA and GLUCOPHAGE - LAB RESULTS order checks
    are not triggered when the medication order for Metformin contains
    lower case letters in GENERIC NAME (#.01) field in the DRUG (#50)
    file.  For instance, a site using TALLman lettering for a Metformin
    order (metFORMIN) did not fire expected order checks. This problem is
    tracked by Patient Safety PSPO #1480.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORKPS has been modified to convert drug name lettering to all
    uppercase before doing the order check comparison. This allows 
    the GLUCOPHAGE - CONTRAST MEDIA order check to function properly.
    The new OCX MDD Condition/Function CONTAINS NOCASE ELEMENT IN SET was
    created to fix the GLUCOPHAGE - LAB RESULTS order check. This function
    allows the lettering case of the orderable item's name to be ignored, 
    which allows the order check to function as expected.

           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System

  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*316):
  
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
  
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select patch OR*3.0*316.

          the install.
      d.  The package will run the S^ORY316ES post-install routine. 
          During the post-install, 13 automatically generated routines
          transport the changes to the Order Check Expert System. As the
          loading and updating of the Expert System occurs, progress
          information is displayed to screen. When prompted by the routine
          "Do you want to change the local 'CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION' 
          field?? YES//", answer YES. This prompt may occur more than once.
  
  5.  After installation completes manually delete the following routines:
      ORY316ES, ORY3160, ORY31601, ORY31602, ORY31603, ORY31604, ORY31605
      ORY31606, ORY31607, ORY3161, ORY3162, ORY3163 and ORY3164.
  
  6.  The user that installs the patch will receive a mailman message with 
      the subject line " Order Check Compiler Status". This message should
