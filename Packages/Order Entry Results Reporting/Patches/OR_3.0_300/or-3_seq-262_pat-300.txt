Subject: Updated CPRS v27 Documentation

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 There have been updates to the documentation for the Computerized 
 Patient Record System (CPRS) v27, released via patch OR*3*243.  The
 purpose of this patch is to inform you of the updates and to encourage you
 to download the latest copy of the documentation before installing patch
 OR*3*243.
  
 Two documents released with CPRS GUI v27 (OR*3*243) require updates:  the 
 Installation Guide and the Release Notes
  
 The Release Notes have been updated to:
  
 - Remove RA*5*70 from the list of Related Patches
 - To correct the statement that IV orders in the Infusion dialog would use
 the "continuous" type by default. The statement was changed to indicate
 that the user must explicitly select the type (continuous or
 intermittent).
  
 The Installation Guide has been updated to:  
  
 - Remove RA*5*70 from the list of Related Patches 
 - Insert an additional post-installation step (shown below)
  
 Evaluate IV Additives and IV Solutions:
 --------------------------------------
  
 Three new fields, IV Type, Route, and Schedule, were implemented in the 
 Infusion Order Dialog in CPRS GUI v27 to address several PSIs, including:
  
 PSI-06-014 How epidural routes appear on the IV tab in BCMA and appear in
 CPRS under IV fluids is contributing to medication errors.
  
 PSI-06-045 The CPRS IV dialogue lacks a field for the provider to enter
 the route of infusion.
  
 PSI-07-036 Epidural QO with default of IV route may result in epidural
 given via IV port 
  
 Implementing these changes requires sites to evaluate their IV Additives 
 and IV Solutions and to set the USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY fields to 
 YES in the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) and IV SOLUTIONS file (#52.7); 
 otherwise, CPRS users will NOT be able to change, copy or renew IV orders.
  
 Update these two fields using the following options:
