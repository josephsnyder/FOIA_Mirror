Subject: Updates and Extensions to the CPRS GUI v27 Functionality

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch contains changes to the ORB PROCESSING FLAG parameter that
 will set the Anatomic Pathology (AP) Results notification to "Mandatory"
 at the User (if defined), Division, & System levels. This change is in
 conjunction with the new AP action alert enhancement that is implemented
 in OR*3.0*243 and LR*5.2*365.
  
 This will ensure that the intended recipient(s) (ie:ordering provider and
 primary care provider) will receive these notifications automatically,
 provided that the above two aforementioned patches have been installed.
 This setting change will also prohibit users from manually
 enabling/disabling this notification in the Computerized Patient Record 
 System Graphical User Interface (CPRS GUI) .
  
 As the purpose of this patch is to programmatically modify the settings of
 the AP Results notification to "Mandatory" at the User, Division, & System
 levels, if this same setting already currently exists at a site, this
 patch will just overwrite the same settings. If a site's parameter setting
 is currently set to "Enabled" or "Disabled" at the User, Division, 
 & System level for this particular notification, this patch will just
 modify it to a "Mandatory" status. However if this particular notification
 instance does not exist at the site's Division & System level, this patch
 will automatically create one and set its value to "Mandatory".
  
 **NOTE: This patch will only change the parameter settings to "Mandatory" 
 at the user level for ONLY those users who have a defined value setting 
 (enabled/disabled) for this notification instance. For those users who do
 not have a defined value setting, the "Mandatory" setting at the Divsion 
 & System levels should apply depending on the next hiearchical level.
  
 If a "Filing error" should ever occur during this process of 
 modification, a Mailman message will be sent to the installer of this 
 patch indicating so and providing instructions on how to manually perform 
 these setting changes at the Division & System levels.
  
 After the patch has successfully installed, sites may choose to delete the
 ORY301 routine if they so choose. This routine contains the functionality 
 to implement the parameter changes mentioned above.
  
 This patch also contains updates to the CPRS GUI v.27 Release Notes and
 Technical Manual. The CPRS GUI v.27 Release Notes erroneously stated that 
 all team lists would be changed to OWNER with the installation of the 
 OR*3.0*243 patch. The Release Notes have now been corrected. With the 
 installation of OR*3.0*243, all team lists will remain as ALLUSERS and 
 will need to be changed to OWNER if the owner would like them to be 
 private.
  
 This patch also adds a new option, Convert IV Inpatient QO to Infusion QO
 [OR CONVERT INP TO QO] to the existing ORDER MENU MANAGEMENT [ORCM MENU].
 This new option allows the Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) to
 convert an IV quick order (set-up as an Inpatient quick order) to the new
 CPRS v27 Infusion quick order format. The Pharmacy ADPAC should be consulted
 when using this option due to the information required to convert the quick
 order to the new CPRS GUI v27 Infusion quick order format. Users should be
 knowledgeable about solutions, infusion rates and additive strength values. 
  
 For more information,  please see the section titled
 "Convert IV Inpatient Quick Order to Infusion Quick Order"
 in the revised CPRS Technical Manual included in the OR_3_301.ZIP file
