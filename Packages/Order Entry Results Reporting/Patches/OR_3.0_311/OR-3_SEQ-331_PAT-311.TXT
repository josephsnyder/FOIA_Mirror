Subject: MOCHA 2.0 ORDER CHECK CPRS CHANGES FOLLOW-UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is part of a group of patches that make up the Medication 
 Order Check Healthcare Application version 2 software (MOCHA v2.0).  
 These patches will add a maximum single dose order check to the current 
 VistA medication order checking system that uses the First DataBank (FDB) 
 business logic and database.  FDB custom dosing tables will be used to 
 store custom dosing changes to FDB standard reference drug tables. 
 Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS) version 2.2 application 
 was developed to meet the customization requirements.
  
 **NOTE**
 When this patch is installed in step 4 of the MOCHA v2.0 installation 
 process, the 'before' checksum of routine ORCMED will be incorrect, as 
 will the second line of that routine because it will not include patch 
 OR*3*380. The functionality introduced with patch OR*3*380 is overwritten 
 by this patch. However, when patch OR*3*381 is installed in step 5 of the 
 MOCHA v2.0 installation process, that will correct the second line of 
 routine ORCMED and restore the functionality from patch OR*3*380.
  
 This patch will address the following issues identified by the MOCHA v2.0 
 test sites:
  
   1. When a medication quick order is created with a dosage that does not 
      match any of the local possible dosages associated with that
      medication, the creator is not warned that dosage checks may not work
      when the quick order is used to create an order. This patch will
      enable the software to warn the quick order creator of the unmatched
      dosage.
   2. When a medication quick order is created for a drug with only local 
      possible dosages and the quick order's dosage is free-text, the quick
      order will not have a dispense drug attached to it. Without a
      dispense drug, dosage order checks will not occur on orders created
      with this quick order. This patch will enable the software to warn
      the clinical application coordinator that dosage order checks will
      not occur.
   3. When a prescription is entered through Outpatient Pharmacy Backdoor
      with a local possible dosage and the associated Computerized Patient 
      Record System order is either transferred to inpatient or 
      copied and then changed, the dosage is converted to free text
      preventing the software from executing the dosage order check. This
      patch will prevent the software from converting the local possible
      dosage to free text.
   4. When transferring, copying, or editing a medication order entered 
      through Pharmacy, dosage order checks were not properly performed for
      simple and complex orders containing local possible or free-text 
      dosages. This patch will enable the software to perform dosage order
      checks on orders containing local possible and free-text dosages 
      transferred, copied, or edited from an order entered through 
      Pharmacy.
   5. Previously CPRS evaluated a Duplicate Therapy message returned from
      Pharmacy that checks all the drugs listed in the Duplicate Therapy 
      message, and if all of those drugs were also in a Duplicate Drug 
      message, the Duplicate Therapy message was not shown. But if a 
      duplicate drug was entered in CPRS, and there was also a second drug
      already on the profile that was part of the duplicate therapy, when 
      that evaluation was made on that Duplicate Therapy message, there is
      now one drug in the Duplicate Therapy message that's not in a 
      Duplicate Drug message, and one drug that is, so the Duplicate
      Therapy message is shown. With this patch, in this case CPRS still 
      shows the Duplicate Therapy message but only lists the drug(s) in
      the Duplicate Therapy that were not also returned in a Duplicate Drug
      message.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. HD756345 6 No duplicate therapy order check displayed to the provider.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A provider places a medication order and receives a duplicate therapy 
 order check message for that order.  The provider places additional 
 orders and then signs all of the orders at once.  When the provider signs 
 all of the orders, the duplicate therapy order check message is not 
 displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 During session order checking, if there are duplicate duplicate therapy 
 order check messages, the duplicates are supposed to be deleted.  
 However, too many duplicate therapy order check messages were deleted.  
 The code has been modified to delete the correct number of duplicate 
 therapy order check messages.
  
 2. HD849668 OERR - Orders Tab:
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A pharmacist enters an order using option Patient Prescription Processing 
 [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS].  A provider then uses CPRS to either copy that 
 order to a new order and edits the new order or edit the existing order.  
 When the new or updated order is sent to Pharmacy, the dosage field 
 contains the drug's strength.  This extraneous information makes it 
 difficult for patients to read the label that is printed for their 
 medication.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The code that loads an existing order into CPRS was modified to correctly 
 differentiate between a pre-defined dosage and free-text dosages.  This 
 modification prevents CPRS from sending the order to Pharmacy with 
 extraneous information in the dosage field.
