Associated patches: (v)OR*3*215    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*246'

Subject: UPDATE ORDER DOSAGE WITH NEW FORMAT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is being released in anticipation of PSS*1.0*78, which modifies
 the format of medication dosages, adding a leading zero to the start of
 dosages less than one, and inserting a space between numeric and unit
 values.  This is to comply with JCAHO standards .
  
 The changes this patch introduces will be transparent to the users until 
 the release of PSS*1.0*78.
  
  
 Associated Remedy Ticket(s):
 ============================
 1.  HD 68012 -   Units needs a leading zero if beginning with a decimal
  
 2.  HD 67761 -  Possible Doses - no space between dose and units
     Duplicates: HD68015, HD68275
  
 3.  HD 70648  - Quick Orders not passing in space or leading zero

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 This patch is being released in anticipation of PSS*1.0*78, which modifies
 the format of medication dosages, adding a leading zero to the start of
 dosages less than one, and inserting a space between numeric and unit
 values.  This is to comply with JCAHO standards.
  
 The changes this patch introduces will be transparent to the users until 
 the release of PSS*1.0*78.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Since medication quick orders save dosage response values, quick orders
 created before PSS*1.0*78 is installed will no longer be able to match
 their saved response values to dosages found on the medication order
 dialog, resulting in medication orders requiring additional pharmacist
 attention.  The same problem exists when taking certain actions on orders,
 since they save response values taken at the time the order was created.
  
 For example, prior to PSS*1.0*78 being installed, the order dialog 
 displays ".1MG" among it's list of allowed dosages, for a particular
 medication.  A quick order that selects this dosage will save the ".1MG"
 text value in it's quick order definition.  When the quick order is used,
 it searches for the ".1MG" entry in the available dosages list, and
 selects the one that matches.  After PSS*1*78 is installed, ".1MG" will
 display as "0.1 MG" in the list of available dosages.  When the quick
 order is used, it will not find a match, since ".1MG" does match "0.1
 MG".  Unless the user manually corrects this, which is not even possible
 with an auto-accept quick order, the order will be sent to pharmacy with a
 free-text dosage value, instead of one that matches the dosage value
 defined in the pharmacy package.
  
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 OR*3.0*246 and PSS*1.0*78 will prevent this problem by intercepting order
 and quick order dosage information that is about to be sent to the CPRS
 GUI for processing in a medication order dialog.  Such dosage information
 is sent to a pharmacy API, added in PSS*1.0*78, which returns an updated
 dosage value that corresponds to the new dosages format.  Local dosages,
 and free text entered dosages, are not updated.  If PSS*1.0*78 is not
 installed, no conversion of the dosage is necessary and will not take 
 place.
  
 With both patches installed, for the above example, even though the quick
 order has saved ".1MG" in it's quick order definition, the ".1MG" value is
 converted to "0.1 MG" before it is sent to CPRS as the quick order
 definition.  This makes CPRS believe that the quick order definition is
 "0.1 MG", and allows it to make the correct match with the available
 dosages, even though ".1MG" is the actual value stored in the file.
  
 NOTE:  The changes introduced in this patch will be transparent to users 
        until PSS*1.0*78 is installed.
