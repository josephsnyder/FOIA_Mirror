 Description:
 ===========
 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v27.  CPRS GUI 
 version 27 consists of two host files: OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID and 
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID. These two host files contain software 
 that support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  The host files were created to 
 simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities.
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.27 and Associated Patches Installation 
 Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_243IG.doc and OR_30_243IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_243.ZIP.
  
 Installation and set-up information specific to OR*3*243 is included in 
 "CPRS GUI v.27 and Associated Patches Installation Guide".  
  
 OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID includes the CPRS and Pharmacy patches required for 
 CPRS GUI v27.  It includes builds for the following patches: 
 OR*3*243
 PSJ*5*134 
 PSO*7*225
  
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID includes the related and required patches 
 needed to support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  It includes builds for 
 the following patches:
 GMRA*4*38
 GMPL*2*35
 GMTS*2.7*80
 LR*5.2*365
 TIU*1*219
 WV*1*23
  
 Installation of the two CPRS host files should be coordinated among the 
 packages affected since these host files will install the majority of the
 software needed to implement CPRS GUI v27. 
  
 Patient Safety Issues
 =======================
  
  --PSI-04-012: Consults Completed without Viewing Reason for Request 
  
 Resolution: Developers added a right-click option to the note editing 
 popup menu to display details of the consult being completed while a 
 consult title is being entered or edited. The new keyboard shortcut is 
 Shift-Ctrl-U. HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-012: OR*3.0*243.
  
  --PSI-04-057: Provider Selecting Wrong Patient with Same First/Last Name 
 (NOIS BHH-1104-40049,Remedy #71065) - On the patient selection screen, if 
 a user typed in some letters of a patient's name, CPRS would try to match
 the selection, go to that part of the patient list, and highlight the 
 first entry that matched the text entered-even if there was more than one 
 possible match. If the user pressed <Enter> without ensuring
 that the correct patient was selected, the user might be looking at the 
 wrong record.
  
 Resolution: To address this problem, developers changed the patient 
 selection list to implement the same auto-unique selection behavior that 
 the mediation order dialog dosage, route, and schedule implements. 
 Specifically, an item in the list will not be selected unless the text 
 typed uniquely identifies the item. If there are multiple items that 
 could match what the user entered, CPRS requires the user to explicitly 
 select the patient.
  
  --PSI-05-001, PSI-06-068, PSI-06-134, PSI-07-014 and PSI-07-031: Make 
 Anatomic Pathology Notifications Action Alerts
  
 Resolution: Anatomic Pathology Results, Mammogram Results, and Pap Smear 
 Results alerts are now action alerts that send the user to the Reports 
 tab, selecting and displaying the report that triggered the alert.
  
 This new feature requires patches WV*1.0*23 and LR*5.2*365.
  
 WV*1.0*23 contains changes to support the pap smear & mammogram action 
 alert generation.
  
 LR*5.2*365 contains changes to the Anatomic Pathology reports display and
 to the alert message text of electronically signed pathology reports. A 
 detailed report for an individual Anatomic Pathology specimen will now be
 retrieved and presented to the user. The alert message text is modified 
 so that it includes additional patient identifiers in the notification to
 precisely identify the patient.
  
  --PSI-05-006: When Discontinuing a Pending Renewal Order the Original 
 Order Became Active Again (Remedy #71193) - Previously in CPRS, if a user
 renewed an order, and then discontinued the renewed order while it was 
 still in a pending state, the renewed order was discontinued, but the 
 original order became active again. 
  
 Resolution: In this situation, CPRS now has a new option that lets the 
 user pick if they want to discontinue the pending renewal order, or 
 discontinue both the pending renewal order and the original order 
 together. 
  
  --PSI-05-007: Invalid Pharmacy Order Number (Remedy #71197) - Sometimes, 
 for unknown reasons, the Pharmacy number stored in the ORDERS file (#100)
 does not match a valid Pharmacy number in the Pharmacy package. This 
 mismatch of numbers caused a problem that did not allow users in CPRS to 
 take actions these orders.
  
 Resolution: When a mismatch occurs, developers modified CPRS to display 
 an error message that tells the user that the order could not be saved 
 and that the user should contact Pharmacy to complete the changes on the 
 order.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-007: OR*3.0*243.
  
  --PSI-05-026: Changes to When CPRS Displays an Expected First Dose for 
 Inpatient Medications - Previously, CPRS was displaying an expected first
 dose for on-call schedules and at other inappropriate times.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the inpatient order dialog for display of 
 the expected first dose:
  --If the schedule is an On Call schedule, CPRS does not display an 
 expected first dose.
  --On the Complex tab, if CPRS finds a PRN schedule, it will not display 
 an expected first dose.
  --On the Complex tab, if CPRS finds a Then conjunction, it will not 
 review any of the lines following that entry. 
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-026: OR*3.0*243.
  
  --PSI-05-027 (CQ 14252 ) and PSI-07-135 (CQ 15176) Viewing Multiple 
 Anatomic Pathology (AP) Reports in CPRS - Previously, anatomic pathology 
 reports were text reports and users had to scroll through the report to 
 find the wanted information.
  
 Resolution:
 Developers changed the report format to a grid reports. Users
 can now select a date to view the information from that time.
  
  --PSI-05-048: System Changes Order from Lab Collect to Ward Collect 
 (Remedy #97102) - Previously, for inpatient lab orders that are of type 
 "lab collect" or "immediate collect", if a continuous schedule was 
 selected (such as QD or QWEEKLY) and a child order falls on a day when 
 the lab cannot perform the collection (for example, weekends or 
 holidays), the collection type was automatically changed to "ward 
 collect", but CPRS did not warn the user. 
  
 Resolution: Developers added an advisory window that initially appears 
 when the user selects "Accept" for that order, advising of any such 
 changes to child orders.  If these orders are left unsigned, the same 
 advisory window will also appear at the point when they are signed or 
 released at some future date. 
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-048: OR*3.0*243.
  
  --PSI-05-063: Incorrect data on Patient Inquiry Report (from CPRS) 
 (Remedy #102307) - To get patient demographics, a user can click once on 
 the Patient Inquiry button. Previously, if a user double-clicked on the 
 Patient Inquiry button and was changing patients, it was possible to get 
 incorrect information. This happened infrequently. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that double-clicking on the 
 Patient Info button (located on the patient bar) will no longer open 
 multiple dialogs. As a result, users will not see incorrect patient data 
 in this box, due to double-clicking, and switching patients.
  
  --PSI-05-065: When Ordering Fluid Bolus, Infusion Rate Does Not Display 
 in Detailed Order Display when Finished as an IVPB (Remedy #103019) - 
 Previously, if a provider entered an order for an infusion bolus and 
 entered a rate at which the fluid should be administered, such as 250 
 ml/hour, and the pharmacist saw the rate and finished the order as an 
 intravenous piggyback (IVPB), the infusion rate information that the 
 clinician entered when ordering a fluid bolus did not display in the CPRS
 Detailed Order Display. The inability of users on the ward, especially 
 nurses, to see the rate might lead to patients being infused at an 
 incorrect rate.
  
 Resolution:
 CPRS displays IVPB infusion rate in CPRS Orders tab detailed
 display.
  
  --PSI-05-093: Saving Patient Information in Personal Quick Orders Based 
 on Resolved TIU Objects (Remedy #69864) - Previously, it was possible to 
 save personal quick orders with TIU objects in them. This caused a 
 problem because when the quick order was saved, it had the information 
 specific to the patient, and when a new patient was selected, the 
 information from the TIU objects was not updated. 
  
 Resolution: This issue was mostly corrected in CPRS v26.  But one 
 uncorrected loophole remained: If a template dialog linked to a consult 
 Reason for Request contained TIU objects, CPRS did not detect the TIU 
 objects, and the order could still be inappropriately saved.  CPRS now 
 detects these objects and does not allow the user to save the personal 
 quick order.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-093: OR*3.0*243.
  
  --PSI-05-103 Parts 1, 3, and 4: Order Check Overrides Not Transmitted to 
 Ancillary Service - When a provider receives an order check with a danger
 level that the site has set as critical, CPRS requires that the provider 
 enter a free-text reason for override. This reason for override text is 
 kept only in the Orders file (file #100), but the text is not transmitted
 along with the order to ancillary services, such as Pharmacy, Radiology, 
 Laboratory, etc., that would act on the order. However, the provider may 
 assume that the text is being sent.
  
 Resolution: This PSI will be addressed in several parts. In CPRS v.27, 
 these items have been changed:
  --The "Return to Orders" button has been implemented on the order 
 checks dialog. This does not cancel the order, but it does cancel the 
 signature process. The provider could then return to the ordering dialog 
 to rework the order.
  --Developers created several reports that sites can run to review the 
 critical order check override reasons. Reports can be extracted and 
 sorted by division, display group, and other appropriate fields. 
  --Developers added a new note to critical order checks that reads 
 "NOTE: The override justification is for tracking purposes and does not 
 change or place new order(s)."
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-103: OR*3.0*243.
  
  --PSI-05-106: Change the Review/Sign Items Form to Break the Orders 
 Signature List into Three Different Groups - In CPRS, there is a 
 parameter that enables sites to have some control of what orders are 
 displayed on the Review/Sign Changes dialog. The parameter OR UNSIGNED 
 ORDERS ON EXIT could be set to include NEW ORDERS ONLY, MY UNSIGNED 
 ORDERS, or ALL UNSIGNED ORDERS. If sites used ALL UNSIGNED ORDERS, CPRS 
 might display orders that were quite old, but had never been signed and 
 the provider might sign orders that should not be signed.
  
 Resolution: To address this issue, the CPRS Clinical workgroup and the 
 Patient Safety Workgroup, made some recommendations. One of the 
 recommendations was that if sites used the ALL UNSIGNED ORDERS options, 
 the orders on the Review/Sign Changes dialog should be separated into 
 three sections:
  --My Unsigned Orders - This Session: This list contains all orders 
 written by the current user in the current session.
  --My Unsigned Orders - Previous Sessions: This list contains all 
 orders written in previous sessions by the current user
  --Others' Unsigned Orders - All Sessions: This list contains all 
 orders written by other users.
  
 This should enable providers to better identify which orders belong to 
 them and which do not.
  
 Another change was that when the user discontinues an unsigned/unreleased
 order, if the order was placed in the current ordering session the order 
 is DELETED.  If the order was placed in a different ordering session, 
 then the order is CANCELLED. Deleted orders do not appear in the chart 
 because other users never saw them, but it is possible that other 
 clinicians saw the order placed in a different session so that 
 information is retained in the chart and the order is given a CANCELLED 
 status.
   
 Note:   Note on Ordering Session-With CPRS 27, how CPRS behaves when a 
 user discontinues (DC) an order is affected by the ordering session. If 
 the order is DC'ed in the same ordering session in which it was created, 
 then it is deleted and no longer remains in the database. If the order is
 DC'ed in a different ordering session, then the order is given a status 
 of CANCELLED and is still in the database in file 100. Special attention 
 should be given to when an ordering session actually ends.  It ends in 
 one of the following 4 ways:
  --The user switches patients
  --The user closes CPRS
  --The user performs a Review/Sign changes Action
  --The user performs a Refresh Patient Information

  --PSI-05-116: Synonym Not Displayed beyond Initial Selection (Remedy 
 #123287) - In the medication ordering dialog, providers can select a 
 medication by its generic name or by a synonym (usually the brand name). 
 When the provider selects the medication, the second ordering dialog 
 displayed the generic medication name without the synonym. If the 
 provider selected the wrong medication and was not familiar with the 
 generic name, the provider might not recognize that it was the wrong 
 medication. 
  
 Resolution: To address this issue, the CPRS Clinical Workgroup 
 recommended changing the Inpatient and Outpatient order dialogs to 
 display both the generic name and the synonym in the order dialog, 
 instead of the only displaying the generic name in the order dialog. Only
 the generic name is saved in the order. Therefore, the Orders tab display
 and the detailed display were not changed. The second order dialog, where 
 the provider enters the rest of the order information, such as dosage, 
 route, and schedule is the only dialog that developers changed.

  --PSI-05-118:
 Caption on the Most Recent Labs Shows 00:00 when No Time Is
 Entered (Remedy #123277) - For the caption on the Labs tab for the "Most 
 Recent Labs" grid and Worksheet, if a lab result had a date but no 
 associated specific time, CPRS was displaying "00:00" if no time was 
 present for those results.
   
 Resolution: If no specific time is entered ("T@U" for an unknown time), 
 CPRS will display only the date. This change applies to the Most Recent 
 Labs and Worksheet views and will not be visible to users until Lab patch
 LR*5.2*364 is also installed.

  --PSI-06-014:
 How Epidural Routes Appear on the IV Tab in BCMA and Appear
 in CPRS Under IV Fluids Is Contributing To Medication Errors (Remedy 
 #128909, 178478)
  
  
 Note:   Full resolution of this PSI will require changes in BCMA, 
 Pharmacy Data Management, and Inpatient Medications
  
 A site reported confusion on the part of a nurse because the medication 
 was displayed on the IV tab in BCMA. 
  
 Resolution:
  --CPRS now includes the medication route for solutions displayed in the 
 Infusions group and on the detailed display.
  --CPRS added three new fields to the IV Order dialog:  Type, Route and 
 Schedule.
  --The new "Type" field will default to "continuous" but may be changed 
 to "intermittent".
  --If the "Type" is "Continuous", the Route defaults based on the 
 Solution/Additive unless there was a conflict or none was selected.
 Then, the user must explicitly select a Route.  An "Infusion Rate (ml/hr)"
 would need to be entered. The Schedule field would be unavailable.
  --If "Type" is "Intermittent", the Route defaults based on the 
 Solution/Additive unless there is a conflict or none was selected. In that
 case, the user must explicitly select a Route. An "Infuse Over Time"
 value would need to be entered with a "Unit of time" designated, and a 
 "Schedule" would need to be entered.
  
  --New quick orders can be built using the new fields. A utility will be 
 provided to "identify" quick orders that were done with an IV Dialog and 
 lack data relevant to the new fields. IV quick orders that do not lack 
 data for the new fields will be treated as continuous orders.
  --When a user writes an intermittent infusion order with a schedule of 
 ONCE, the following will happen in CPRS:
       --Disable the display of DURATION
       --Only VOLUME should be displayed
       --Disable the doses, hrs, and days choices for VOLUME
  
 --PSI-06-015: Dosage with an Initial Decimal Point Disallowed (Remedy 
 #129134) - Previously, a provider could enter a free-text dosage that 
 began with a decimal point, such as .5MG, in an order dialog. This dosage
 could be misread as 5MG rather the .5MG. In addition, the provider could 
 edit a dosage and the sig might not be updated if the provider made the 
 change and immediately used the close (X) button of the dialog and 
 accepted the order. In this case, a provider might have entered a dosage 
 such as 5.5MG and then noticed the error and removed the initial number 
 leaving a .5 dosage. But if the provider made the change and clicked the 
 close button, the sig was not updated properly and the sig was saved as 
 5.5MG.
  
 Resolution: Developers added a check to the dosage field so that if a 
 provider enters a dosage with an initial decimal point, CPRS displays an 
 error message stating that the dosage must begin with a numeric value. 
 The provider will not be able to complete the order until the dosage has 
 a numeric value before the decimal point. For example, if the provider 
 enters a dosage of .5MG, CPRS will display the error message, and the 
 provider would need to change the dosage to 0.5MG to avoid confusion. The
 order could then be accepted. The problem with editing a value and the 
 sig not being updated was also corrected.

 --PSI-06-023: (Remedy #132020) - (Duplicate of PSI-05-006)
  
 --PSI-06-041: Flag Does Not Display in VistA Outpatient Pharmacy (Remedy 
 #133716) - Previously, users could flag a pending order in CPRS, 
 Inpatient Medications, or Outpatient Pharmacy, and the flag would display
 in CPRS and Inpatient Medications, but not in Outpatient Pharmacy.
 If one Pharmacist was working on an order and flagged it so that is was 
 not acted upon by another Outpatient Pharmacist, the flag did not display 
 in the Outpatient Pharmacy package, and another pharmacist could finish 
 the order thereby creating a potential danger for the patient.
  
 Resolution:  The user may flag outpatient order and have the update sent 
 to outpatient pharmacy.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-06-041: PSO*7*225.
  
 --PSI-06-045: (E3R #18904) - (Duplicate of PSI-06-014)
  
 --PSI-06-066: IV Fluid Order in CPRS with a Duration or Total Volume of a
 Fractional Dose (e.g., 0.5L) Causes Problem in Pharmacy Finishing (Remedy
 #144913) - Previously, if a user entered an IV Fluid order in CPRS and 
 used a fractional dose such as "0.5L" in the Duration or Total Volume 
 window, the leading zero caused a problem when finishing the order in 
 pharmacy.
  
 For the pharmacy application, in field #2, Solutions, instead of 
 displaying IV Limit with the proper information, it displayed Duration: 
 without a value. Also, in the display for START DATE/TIME and STOP 
 DATE/TIME, the time span is only 6 minutes. Unless changed, the order 
 would have only a 6-minute ACTIVE status and could easily be missed in 
 BCMA because it could expire before the RN sees it.
  
 Resolution: OR*3.0*254 addresses the PSI. Developers also changed CPRS 
 (OR*3.0*243) to consistently manage entry of leading zeros at the user 
 interface level. CPRS v.27 forces the provider to add a leading numeric 
 value when entering a fractional duration for ml and L. This change also 
 applies to the volume/strength field on the Infusion dialog.
  
 --PSI-06-068: See PSI-05-001
  
 --PSI-06-088: Consults Alert Changes (Remedy #151414) - When sending 
 alerts on addition of a comment to a consult request, no distinction was 
 made between service update users defined at the service level and update 
 users defined as "unrestricted access" for that service. Alerts were 
 being sent incorrectly or not sent at all as a result of this.  
  
 Resolution: CPRS developers made the necessary changes to support patch 
 GMRC*3.0*55 that will correct the issues when installed.
  
 --PSI-06-104: RDV Health Summaries via CPRS (Remedy #139560) - 
 Previously, when using the CPRS Reports tab, if a patient had remote 
 Department of Defense (DOD) data available and the user attempted to 
 retrieve a Health Summary report via the DOD tab (with Dept. of Defense 
 checked in the Remote Data button), the report did not populate.
  
 Resolution: This problem goes beyond Health Summary reports and what is 
 displayed when using or not using DOD/FHIE sites/Reports. All reports 
 will experience this problem depending on what the user has selected and 
 which remote sites are in an active query. The same issue will exist when 
 the HDR comes online for CPRS.
  
 Developers provided "cognitive" information when data is excluded on a 
 report query. For text reports only, CPRS adds a comment that describes 
 the problem where the report would normally be. For 'grid' type reports, 
 the error comment is put in the first column (after the facility name) of 
 the report. Here are some examples of the comments that could show up, 
 depending on the type of query and what the user has selected:
   --<No HDR Data Included> - Use "HDR Reports" menu for HDR Data.
   --<No HDR Data> - This site is not a source for HDR Data.
   --<No DOD Data> - Use "Dept. of Defense Reports" Menu to retrieve data 
 from DOD.
   --<ERROR> - Unable to communicate with Remote site
  
 In addition to this text, error messages will also be shown after each 
 remote site listed under the (blue) Remote Data View button, when 
 appropriate.
  
 Also, additional data has been added to the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24) 
 to resolve this problem, which means that this file will be re-exported, 
 with data, in patch OR*3.0*243. As part of the installation (pre-init) 
 process, entries in this file with internal numbers greater than 999 will 
 be deleted and re-installed. 
  
 --PSI-06-126: Duration Not Always Sent from CPRS to Inpatient Medications 
 (Remedy #158989) - When an IV Quick Order with a duration defined the 
 duration field was auto-accepted, the duration was populating the Order 
 File, but it was not sent to the Pharmacy package.
  
 Resolution: CPRS now passes the duration to the Pharmacy package. In 
 addition, CPRS now has additional validation that the entry is 
 appropriate to be passed. If the user enters a value, such as 3, and a 
 unit, such as days, but the user then changes the unit to hours, CPRS 
 will remove the 3 and force the user to reenter the value. This is to 
 prevent duration errors. If the user writes an order that has a duration 
 type, but the user does not enter a duration, CPRS will not accept the 
 order, but will display a warning message.
  
 --PSI-06-134: See PSI-05-001
  
 --PSI-06-167: Auto-DC Rule Does Not DC the Meds when Medication Order Has 
 an Outpatient Location (Inpatient Status) as the Ordering Location 
 (Remedy #167203) - Previously, if an inpatient went for an outpatient 
 visit (or appointment) and the provider changed the location in CPRS from 
 the inpatient location to the outpatient location and entered medication 
 orders, the result was that the order filed under the outpatient order 
 location and under Inpatient Meds display group. If at a later date, the 
 patient has a treating specialty change, CPRS discontinues all medication 
 orders EXCEPT those entered with the outpatient location. In 
 discontinuing the medication orders, the software checked the patient 
 location where the order was entered, and if the location was an 
 outpatient location, the order did NOT get discontinued. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the CPRS Auto-DC rules to DC the order if 
 it is an inpatient order no matter if the ordering location is an 
 outpatient location.
  
 --PSI-06-170: Default Value in TIU Template Dialog Can Be Set to 
 Incorrectly Checked (Remedy #166177) - Previously on TIU template dialogs 
 that had nested check box lists (where selecting the first level 
 activated the second level of check boxes) and one of the second-level 
 check boxes was a default, it was possible when the user unchecked the 
 default and went to another nested check box item that the default item 
 was once again checked when it should not have been.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the behavior where the check box could 
 automatically become checked again, and the check boxes should now 
 function correctly.
  
 --PSI-06-172: Custom Order View Does Not Display Unverified by Nursing 
 Orders Correctly after CPRS v. 26 (Remedy #168472)
  
 Resolution: Developer changed the routine used to retrieve orders based 
 on date and time to properly handle date and time.
  
 --PSI-06-173: Providers without DEA Number Can Place IV Quick Orders 
 (Remedy #167843) - Previously, providers who did not have a DEA number, 
 and therefore were not authorized to place some orders, could place these 
 orders through the IV quick order features. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to cancel out of an IV Quick Order 
 when the provider does not pass the pharmacy DEA check. The same check 
 now occurs when the user is signing the order to catch auto-accept quick 
 orders.
  
 --PSI-06-192: User May Give Additional Dose Now in the Inpatient 
 Medication Dialog Box with a Medication Schedule of ONCE or ONE-TIME 
 (Remedy #172339) - Previously, CPRS allowed the user to select the "Give 
 additional dose now" checkbox in the inpatient medication dialog box with 
 medication schedules of ONCE or ONE-TIME if the user was changing the 
 medication order, transferring outpatient medications to inpatient 
 medications, or copying to a new order. The checkbox was NOT selectable 
 when the user was entering the medication the first time. The checkbox 
 being selectable allowed the user to place two orders for the same 
 medication, but CPRS did NOT alert the physician by displaying a pop-up 
 warning dialog box as did the other schedules that told the physician two 
 orders for the medication had been created.
  
 Resolution: Developers modified CPRS to not display the "Give additional 
 dose now" checkbox for any ONCE or ONE-TIME schedule. 
  
 --PSI-07-013: Orders Are Not Discontinuing as Expected--Error Message 
 States "Invalid Pharmacy Order" (Remedy #175403) - Duplicate of 
 PSI-05-007.
  
 --PSI-07-014: See PSI-05-001
  
 --PSI-07-025: Update Provider/Location--Primary Focus Is Not on Encounter 
 Provider (Remedy #166051) - In CPRS v.25, when the user went to "Update 
 Provider/Location", the primary focus when the dialog opened was on the 
 encounter provider, but with CPRS v.26, the focus was changed and the 
 primary focus was on the bottom portion of the screen - Visit Location 
 for outpatient medication orders, Clinic Appointments for inpatient 
 medications, etc.
  
 Resolution: Developers modified CPRS GUI v.27 so that the focus defaults 
 to the Provider list box for non-provider users.
  
 --PSI-07-031: See PSI-05-001
  
 --PSI-07-036: Epidural QO with Default of IV Route May Result in Epidural 
 Given via IV Port (Remedy #178478) - Duplicate of PSI-06-045.
  
 --PSI-07-046: Delayed Orders Entered for Transfer to Surgery Cancelled on 
 Discharge from Observation (Remedy #180390, E3R #20065) - When an 
 inpatient was in a ward with an observation treating specialty and the 
 patient was transferred, the delayed orders were inappropriately 
 cancelled.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that transfer events will no 
 longer be selectable from the delayed orders event selection list for 
 patients in an observation treating specialty.
  
 --PSI-07-057: Potential for Inappropriate or Misleading Provider Comments 
 to Be Automatically Included on New Medication Orders (Remedy # 151112, 
 173739, 182047) -  For outpatient medications, a patient safety issue 
 arose because a provider could inadvertently include the comments for an 
 outpatient medication when doing a renew, copy, or change action on an 
 existing order. 
  
 Previously, when placing an outpatient medication order in CPRS, the 
 provider could include the default Patient Instructions (if any exist) 
 for the medication and could include additional instructions to the 
 pharmacist in the Provider Comments. When finishing the order, the 
 pharmacist could copy the Provider Comments into the Patient Instructions 
 to create one set of instructions for the patient; the final sig returned 
 from OP contains only this one instruction, and the order is changed in 
 the Orders file to reflect the update if necessary.
  
 CPRS keeps both the original Provider Comments and the updated Patient 
 Instructions with the order. If the order text was rebuilt as a result of 
 a copy, renewal, change, or transfer, CPRS included both in the dialog. 
  
 Resolution: 
   --CPRS does not bring the Provider Comments forward for the Copy to 
 New, Renewal, and Change actions.
   --CPRS DOES bring forward Provider Comments when transferring 
 medications from outpatient to inpatient.
   --Both items are still retained in the detailed display.
  
 --PSI-07-063: Schedule Missing from Two CPRS Reports on the Reports Tab / 
 Clinical Reports / Pharmacy - Previously, the schedule did not display on 
 two reports, those dealing with active IV medications and all IV 
 medications. 
  
 Resolution: Developers added the schedule to both of these reports.
  
 --PSI-07-177:  Display on "Medication Nearing Expiration" Alert Does Not 
 Match Status of Order -- An expiring medication may not get renewed or 
 there may be a delay in renewal since what is displayed on the CPRS 
 Orders tab upon processing the "Medications nearing expiration" alert 
 doesn't appear to match the status of the order.  The user is routed to 
 the correct order, but the status displays as "dc/edit".  
  
 Resolution: Developers modified CPRS to include a fix for PSI-07-177. 
 Currently when a user processes a "Medication Nearing Expiration" alert 
 (after the expiration date/time) on a changed inpatient meds order (order 
 with an ACTION of change), the user will be directed to the list of 
 "expired" (status) orders under the Recently Expired Orders view of the 
 Orders tab. Only those orders that have "expired" will be displayed in 
 the corresponding view and not those that have been "Discontinued/Edit" 
 or "dc/edit". If the alert was processed before the expiration date/time, 
 CPRS directs the user to the list of orders (with a status of ACTIVE) 
 that are going to expire soon under the Medications, Expiring view on the 
 Orders tab.
  
 --PSI-07-212: Upon Patient Movement, the Event-Delayed NPO Order Was 
 Discontinued, Causing the Activation of a Regular Diet
  
 Resolution: This is not easily corrected, if possible at all, but the 
 user is now prompted about the possible conflict, and instructed on how 
 to prevent it from happening by entering explicit start and stop 
 date/times for any diet orders defined for that same release event. 
 Developers also added code to check for auto-accept diet quick orders, 
 immediate and delayed, that would auto-DC because of overlapping 
 start/stop times. For event-delayed, auto-accept diet quick orders, CPRS 
 checks for conflicting orders for the same release event, and if the user 
 answers NO to the prompt about having adjusted the start/stop dates, CPRS 
 displays the diet order dialog with that quick order pre-loaded so date 
 adjustments can be made.
  
 --PSI-08-019: CPRS Freezes When Users Double-Click Reminders - 
 Previously, providers using reminders would sometimes double-click on a 
 reminder and it would freeze CPRS.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the problem-inadvertent double-clicking 
 on reminders no longer freezes CPRS.
  
 --PSI-08-066: Cannot See Notes in Remote Data - Not all DoD progress 
 notes were displayed upon selecting ALL RESULTS for a date range via the 
 CPRS-Reports tab-Clinical
  
 Reports-Progress Notes option.   Older progress notes were not 
 displayed.  No error was displayed.  The DoD selection was made via 
 Remote Data Views (RDV).
  
 ALL RESULTS is sending "T-66666" as the start date (approximately year 
 1826) and DoD fails on any date before 1/1/1841.
  
 Resolution:  Developers modified CPRS GUI v27 to set the earliest date 
 possible to approximately 1871 or t-50000 to keep DoD from choking
  
 --PSI-08-079: An Alert Will Not Be Forwarded to a Recipient if the User 
 Types in a Name Then Presses the ENTER Key when Forwarding an Alert from 
 the CPRS GUI Patient Selection Screen - Previously, an alert would not 
 forward to a recipient if the user typed in a name then pressed the ENTER 
 key when forwarding an alert from the CPRS GUI Patient Selection screen.  
 The user may think they are forwarding the alert but they are not.  (To 
 forward to the named entry, the user must use the mouse.).
  
 Resolution:  Developers modified CPRS to include 'ADD' and 'REMOVE' 
 buttons so that someone can add/remove recipients without having to use 
 the mouse. They can 'enter' to select, but there are also the buttons.
  
  
 Known Issues
 ================
 Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE) 
  
 --BHIE-Inconsistency in Display of DoD Vitals, Cytology, Anatomic Path 
 Data Description:  In CPRS 27, the Lab Anatomic Pathology report (CY, SP)
 formats were changed in response to a PSI. The same changes could not be 
 made to the reports used for Bidirectional Health information 
 Exchange/Department of Defense (BHIE/DOD) until the changes were 
 coordinated with similar changes on the BHIE/DOD side of things. Until 
 the BHIE/DOD versions of these reports are made consistent with the VA 
 versions of these reports, they cannot include a mix of both VA and DOD 
 data in a single report, which is the way it was prior to CPRS 27. 
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact.
 Workaround:  Data is available but not co-mingled
  
 Comments:  As soon as the BHIE/DOD version of these reports can be 
 changed to be consistent with the new formats found in CPRS 27, the 
 changes necessary to re-integrate VA and DOD data into these reports will 
 be made in CPRS.  Software requirements to implement the report format 
 modifications were provided to DOD in January 2008.
  
 --BHIE-Graphing on VA pt,->changed to DoD pt->went to DoD- Vitals -> 
 clicked on REMOTE DATE->selected DoD, graph opens
 Description: This problem occurs when a user selects a patient and graphs 
 blood pressure (BP) for local data, then selects new patient and changes 
 the view to the Cover Sheet tab. When the user clicks on the Reports tab, 
 the BP graph reappears for about 0.5 seconds and then disappears 
 immediately.
  
 Risk/Impact:  Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Workaround:  None
  
 Comments:  This is considered a minor annoyance and has been resolved in 
 CPRS GUI v27.n
  
 Notes/Note Tools
 --Template Editor:  Problem with ASSOCIATED CONSULT SERVICE Field
 Description: When the user types in the name of the Associated Consult 
 Service field to associate this template with Consult a message box 
 displays indicating the this service is already assigned to another 
 template.  If I type in only M then I am allowed to scroll through the 
 list of consult titles that begin with M to find the one I want to use.  
 This happens with all consults; not just this one
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  If the user types in the first character, they may scroll 
 through the list of consult titles and select the desired entry.  
  
 Comments:  Only Clinical Application Coordinators use this functionality. 
 The problem is considered an annoyance and resolution has been deferred 
 to CPRS GUI v27.n
  
 --CPRS Will Not Find or Highlight a Key Word that Is Being Searched
 Description: This problem occurs occasionally when the user selects View, 
 Search for Text, Find, types a key word in to search for in the progress 
 notes, and CPRS will not find or highlight the word that is being 
 searched for. 
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  The problem occurs occasionally. When the user re-attempts 
 the search, the search is successful.
  
 Comments:  The problem was reported and then fixed.  After t77 was 
 created, the site reported that the problem continues to occur 
 occasionally.  It has been deferred for resolution in CPRS GUI v27.n
  
  
 Orders 
 --Cannot Create a Unit Dose Quick Order Using the Format Available in the 
 Quick Order Editor 
 Description: When creating the Quick Order (QO) in VistA, if a dosage is 
 not selected as part of QO creation, then the QO dialog does not present 
 Route or Schedule for selection (these options are bypassed). 
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  On GUI, the QO can be selected, but user must then fill-in 
 the route and the schedule along with the DOSAGE.
  
 Comments:  This is viewed as an annoyance and has been deferred for 
 resolution in v28.
  
 --Order Displays under Inpatient Meds on Meds Tab but Not on the Orders 
 Tab
 Description: In the reported issue, both orders captured were still 
 active, and the discontinue (DC) action was unsigned, which was correct; 
 the only problem was with the Out Patient display group on the inpatient 
 med order released after admission.  
  
 The new order was created by copying and delaying the original order, so 
 the new order was tied to a release event.  Because it was a manual event 
 and the patient was not yet admitted, the Out Patient meds display group 
 was assigned and that  prevented the order from displaying in the Active 
 view on the Orders Tab after release since the patient had been admitted 
 by then.
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  None
  
 Comments:  This scenario will be reevaluated in CPRS GUI v29 when delayed 
 events and locking will be reevaluated in conjunction with Inpatient 
 Medication, Outpatient Pharmacy, and Registration.  There are several 
 PSIs documenting similar issues that will be addressed in CPRS GUI v29.
  
 --Error Message on Nurse Verification of IV 
 Order-<UNDEFINED>LIMSTOP+7^PSIVORFB
 Description: An <UNDEFINED>LIMSTOP+7^PSIVORFB error occurs when Nurse 
 Verification of an IV Order is initiated.  This problem occurs in 
 Inpatient Medications code. 
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  None
  
 Comments:  This is a known issue that will be addressed in PSJ*5*207, 
 which is in the queue for national release immediately after CPRS GUI 
 v27.  The problem is documented in Remedy tickets 230800 and 233925.
  
 --Can't Change, Renew, or Copy To New Order an IVPB Solution-Must Rewrite 
 Entire Order and DC Soon To Expire Order
 Description: This problem has been reported by one provider at Hudson 
 Valley Health Care (HVHC).  It cannot be duplicated by development 
 staff.  No other CPRS GUI v27 test site has experienced this problem.  It 
 is believed that this may be a set-up issue at the site.
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  User would need to enter a new order.
  
 Comments:  This is believed to be a set-up issue. The ticket has been 
 left open in case another site reports this problem. Since the 
 development team cannot duplicate the problem, it is not possible to fix 
 it.
  
 --Incorrect Location Displayed on Visit Location Switch Form
 Description: Northern California Health Care System reported a single 
 incident where a NHCU patient was seen in an outpatient clinic and when 
 orders were entered, the Visit Location Switch Form displayed the 
 incorrect location.
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  Select the correct location.
  
 Comments: This issue has only been reported once. The development team 
 has not been able to duplicate the problem but believes that a specific 
 sequence of steps may prevent a variable from being killed (cleared). 
 This ticket has been left open for further evaluation in CPRS GUI v28.
  
 --"CPRS - Patient Chart" Error Dialog" Reappears No Matter Which Signing 
 Method Is Used
 Description: This problem has existed since CPRS GUI v27.2 when a 
 correction was made to address:  CQ: 10073 - PSI-05-106 Accidental 
 Signing of Old Orders in CPRS. The occurrence of this problem is very, 
 very rare and occurs only when the steps to duplicate it are explicitly 
 followed. Only Charleston reported the problem, and Steve produced the 
 problem when testing another PSI. In order to test that PSI, he had to 
 set up the environment that created this problem.
  
 One must initiate delayed orders for two patients during the same 
 ordering session, the delayed event must occur before the orders are 
 signed; the problem occurs on the second patient.
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  Shut down CPRS and log-back in. The order is available for 
 signing.
  
 Comments:  This problem has not been reported by any site even though the 
 issue has existed since testing began in April 2007. It was reported when 
 the specific environment was set-up to test another PSI. This has been 
 deferred for resolution in CPRS GUI 27.n
  
 Other
 --Name of Patient Changes, But The Chart Does Not
 Description: One provider at Hudson Valley Health Care has reported this 
 problem.  No other users at any site have experienced this issue.  The 
 problem occurred when the provider started following-up on her patient at 
 her office workstation and left her office to do rounds.  She locked her 
 workstation, but did not log-out of CPRS.  She then did rounds and access 
 several other workstations on the wards.  Finally, when she returned to 
 her office and selected a new patient, she noticed that the Notes tab and 
 the Orders tab included data from the previous patient.
  
 Risk/Impact: High Risk/High Impact
  
 Work Around:  Completely log-out of CPRS and log back in. All tabs are 
 refreshed appropriately.
  
 Comments:  This problem was reported by one provider in February and has 
 occurred multiple times but cannot be duplicated.  No other providers 
 have reported the problem.  Several measures have been taken to prevent 
 this from happening for this provider; CCOW has been disabled; CPRS 
 timeout has been implemented; activation of multiple concurrent CPRS 
 sessions has been prevented.  Despite multiple attempts to shadow the 
 provider and attempt to duplicate the problem, it cannot be duplicated.
  
 The development team continues work on this problem and will resolve it 
 as soon as the problem can be duplicated.
  
 --Sign Order Box Never Displays
 Description: This problem only occurs when the previously described issue 
 occurs.  A provider signs onto CPRS enters an order and goes through the 
 steps of signing the order but is unable to sign the order because the 
 sign order box never displays.
  
 The provider then switches to a different patient and the order written 
 on the original patient appears in the new pt's order display as an 
 unsigned order.
  
 Risk/Impact: High Risk/High Impact
  
 Work Around:  Completely log-out of CPRS and log back in. All tabs are 
 refreshed appropriately and this problem does not occur.
  
 Comments: This problem was reported by one provider in February and has 
 occurred multiple times but cannot be duplicated. No other providers have 
 reported the problem. Several measures have been taken to prevent this 
 from happening for this provider; CCOW has been disabled; CPRS timeout 
 has been implemented; activation of multiple concurrent CPRS sessions has 
 been prevented.  Despite multiple attempts to shadow the provider and 
 attempt to duplicate the problem, it cannot be duplicated.
  
 The development team is continues work on this problem and will resolve 
 it as soon as the problem can be duplicated.
  
 --MH DLL Active Screen behind CPRS
 Description: When a user attempts it execute the Mental Health DLL from 
 within CPRS (typically using a Clinical Reminder that executes a Mental 
 Health testing instrument), the MH DLL form is partially hidden by CPRS.
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  The user can click on the Mental Health DLL and give it 
 focus.
  
 Comments:  CPRS GUI v27 resolves numerous problems where forms were 
 inaccessible because they were hidden; however, use of the MH DLL was 
 introduced with CPRS GUI v27.  This form is partially hidden, but 
 accessible.  This will be addressed in CPRS GUI v28.
  
  
 --RDV Reports from v.26 Displayed in a v.27 Account 
 Description: In CPRS v.27, developers added a new field called "Reason 
 for Study" to accommodate the need of third-party radiology products. As 
 a result, the Radiology reports in CPRS v.27 also changed. This created a 
 problem with the display of reports created in v.26, but displayed in 
 v.27. The new field created a mismatch between the headings in the 
 report, and the data that followed
  
 Risk/Impact: Low risk/Low impact
  
 Work Around: None
  
 Comments: This issue will be resolved when all sites have installed CPRS 
 v.27.
  
  
 VBECS-Blood Product Management
 All the VBECS issues listed below will be considered for resolution in 
 CPRS GUI v27.n.  Only two sites, Philadelphia and St. Louis, have 
 implemented VBECS in production.  San Diego is scheduled for production 
 installation of VBECS on August 9, 2008.  All of these issues have been 
 discussed with the CPRS/VBECS test sites. 
  
 Reports of CPRS/VBECS issues have been delayed due to the limited 
 production testing of CPRS/VBECS ordering functionality.  Philadelphia 
 installed VBECS into production initially, and then St. Louis installed 
 on July 19.  The problems listed below were reported after CPRS GUI 
 v27.77 was created.  In conjunction with the CPRS/VBECS test sites, a 
 decision was made to proceed forward with national release and address 
 these issues in either CPRS GUI v27.n or CPRS GUI v28.
  
 --VBECS-San Diego-Quick Orders: Labs linked to Whole Blood and RED BLOOD 
 CELLS Do Not Display in  "Lab Results" of Dialog 
 Description: Lab results are being displayed properly when they are 
 available and are supposed to be displayed; however, the tab changes from 
 "Lab Results" to "Lab Results Available", even when there are no results 
 available.  This is misleading.  The tab should remain "Lab Results" if 
 there are no results to be displayed.
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around: N/A
  
 Comments:  This has been resolved in CPRS GUI v27.n
  
 --VBECS: "Date/Time Wanted" Does Not Display in the Printed/Displayed Lab 
 Order in CPRS
 Description: "Date/Time Wanted" Does Not Display in the Printed/Displayed 
 Lab Order in CPRS
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  Date/Time Wanted is displayed on Detailed Display of the 
 order.
  
 Comments:  This issue was discussed with the test sites on 6/12.  There 
 was unanimous agreement that displaying the "Date/Time Wanted" in the 
 order detailed display was sufficient for this version.
  
 --VBECS-Non-Quick Order VBECS Dialog:  System Thinks that 'Now' Is a Time 
 in the Past
 Description: In a Quick Order and a "Non-Quick Order", when the user 
 creates an order and adds a Diagnostic test, clicks to open the Change 
 Date/Time for the Collection Date/Time and clicks the "NOW" button, 
 clicks OK and then clicks Accept Order, CPRS displays a message stating 
 that "Collection times in the past are not allowed".
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  User may enter a date/time.
  
 Comments:  Current functionality is consistent with the Lab dialog.  If a 
 change is made, it should be done to both the Lab order dialog as well as 
 the Blood Bank order dialog.  This will be reviewed by CPRS Clinical Work 
 Group and evaluated whether it should go in V28.
  
 --VBECS Date/Time, Urgency Elements Need to Be Consolidated or Cross 
 Examined
 Description: St. Louis surgeons reported June 19, 2008, that The 
 Date/Time's and Urgency elements need to be consolidated or cross 
 examined. Blood Component, Diagnostic Tests, and Urgency can each have 
 its own time. Blood Component can be set to NOW, TYPE AND SCREEN can be 
 set to Next scheduled lab collection, and Urgency can be set to Routine.  
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around: N/A
  
 Comments: This was reported with CPRS GUI v27 t77. The site agreed that 
 it could wait for resolution until CPRS GUI v27.n
  
 --VBECS Input Validation; Blood Component Field Allows Free Text
 Description: Blood Component field allows free text. It doesn't validate 
 the entry until the Accept Order button is pressed. Validation should be 
 triggered as soon as the focus changes the user down-clicks another field.
  
 Risk/Impact: Low Risk/Low Impact
  
 Work Around:  N/A
  
 Comments:  This was reported with CPRS GUI v27.76, but was considered a 
 low priority by the site.  It will be evaluated for resolution in CPRS 
 GUI v27.n
  
 New Parameters
 ==================
 CPRS v.27 (OR*3.0*243) adds several new parameters. These parameters 
 should be set by the person at your site that normally controls the 
 parameter settings. Some parameters can be set by the user while some 
 must be set by a Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC) or Information 
 Resource Management (IRM) personnel. A CAC or IRM staff should set the 
 parameters below.
 --OR ADMIN TIME HELP TEXT
 --OR CLOZ INPT MSG
 --OR DC REASON LIST 
 --OR FLAGGED ORD REASONS
 --OR LAPSE ORDERS
 --OR LAPSE ORDERS DFLT
 --OR MEDS TAB SORT
 --OR RA RFS CARRY ON
 --OR USE MH DLL
 --ORWDXVB VBECS TNS CHECK
 --ORWLR LC CHANGED TO WC
  
 New Functionality
 ===================
 About Box
 --About CPRS Dialog Has Incorrect Email Address
  
 Resolution:  Developers changed the email address to the correct email 
 address.
  
 Encounter Form and Signature Forms
 --New Environmental Indicator: SHD (Shipboard Hazard And Defense) - 
 Developers added a new Environmental Indicator to Co-pay and CIDC Review 
 and Sign Orders dialogs-SHD. The encounter form has also been modified to 
 prompt for the new option (SHD). The SHD definition will display as a 
 hint when the provider hovers over "SHD" in the co-pay portion of the 
 Order Signature dialogs or uses the keyboard combination Alt + h.
  
 The Health Frame information is as follows:
 Veterans with conditions recognized by VA as associated with Project 112/ 
 SHAD, shipboard and land-based biological and chemical testing conducted 
 by the United States (U.S.) military between 1962 and 1973 are eligible 
 for enrollment in priority group 6, unless eligible for enrollment in a 
 higher priority. In addition, veterans receive care at no charge for care 
 and medications provided for treatment of conditions related to exposure. 
  
 Meds
 --New Sorting Capabilities on the Meds Tab - Developers added the 
 capability to sort the medications on the Meds tab in the following ways:
   --Sort by Status/Exp Date (IMO first on Inpt)
   --Sort by Status Group/Status/Location/Drug Name
   --Sort by Drug (alphabetically)/status active/status recent expired
  
 Orders
 --New Blood Bank (VBECS) Ordering Dialog - With CPRS v.27 and OR*3.0*212, 
 CPRS adds a new dialog that will enable clinicians to electronically 
 order blood products using the VistA Blood Establishment Computer System 
 (VBECS). This new dialog has three tabs: Patient Information, Orders, and 
 Lab Results.
  
 The Patient Information tab shows blood product information, such as 
 available units, those that are autologous, directed, and allogeneic. It 
 gives information such as lab accession number for units and what their 
 status is, such as are they just available, have they been crossmatched, 
 or have they been assigned.
  
 The Orders tab is where clinicians place orders for various blood 
 products, for units of blood, plasma, red blood cells, platelets, for 
 example. The dialog will prompt the user for needed information, such as 
 ordering a type and screen for some units. Users can also place the order 
 and put a desired date when the blood product is needed, such as for a 
 future surgery.
  
 The Lab Results tab shows the results of lab tests the may have been 
 ordered related to the blood products. The lab results are displayed in 
 this tab for the user's convenience so that they do not have to go to the 
 Labs tab for information when ordering blood products.
  
 --Radiology "Reason for Study" Prompt - The Radiology package is 
 implementing a PACS messaging and Voice Recognition interface that needs 
 "Reason for Study" split out from "Clinical History". Prior to this 
 version, "Clinical History" had been a catch-all; it collected unlimited 
 text which the users have been accustomed to entering both the clinical 
 history of the patient and the reason for the study. 
  
 Resolution: Developers added a new "Reason for Study" prompt to the 
 Radiology ordering dialog. CPRS still prompts for "Clinical History", but 
 it is no longer required, while "Reason for Study" is a required entry.  
 Until Radiology patch RA*5.0*75 is released, both items will still appear 
 in "Clinical History" in that package, but will appear separately in the 
 ORDERS file. 
  
 Developers also added validity checking to CPRS for the optional 
 "Clinical History" field. Following Radiology's validation rules, CPRS 
 will validate that this field contains at least one occurrence of two 
 consecutive alphanumeric non-space characters. If it does not find them, 
 CPRS will display a warning message and will not accept the order.
  
  
 Note:   Radiology patch RA*5.0*75 will correct the issue where a user 
 enters no Clinical History at all, and the order is rejected by Radiology 
 on signature/release.
  
 Also, to aid sites that have radiology quick orders that may need to be 
 edited, developers created patch OR*3.0*281, which will search for VistA 
 and personal radiology quick orders that have text defined in the 
 existing History and Reason for Exam field. The patch will create a mail 
 message with a list of quick orders-including disabled quick orders-that 
 will need to be reviewed to see if the text should be edited. Part of the 
 text now in the History and Reason for Exam field may need to be moved to 
 the new Reason for Study field. The new field has a size limit of 64 
 characters so the change must be made by a person who can review what, if 
 any, portion of the text should be moved into the new field.
  
 IRM or CAC personnel can run the report after OR*3.0*281 is installed by 
 using the ORCM RA STUDY option.
  
 --New Clozapine Requirements
 With the Food and Drug Administration required changes for administering 
 Clozapine, the following criteria must be met for a provider to order 
 Clozapine:  
   --The patient is part of the treatment program.
   --The patient has proper WBC (White Blood Count) and ANC (Absolute 
 Neutrophil   --Count) lab tests within the past 7 days. 
   --The ordering provider has the YSCL AUTHORIZED key.
   --The ordering provider has a valid Drug Enforcement Agency number or 
 Veterans   -- Administration number (DEA/VA#).
  
 The other order checks related to Clozapine will continue to work as they 
 have prior to these changes. 
  
 Additionally, the values of the Days Supply, Quantity, and Refills fields 
 are restricted based on the type of patient that Mental Health designates 
 in their files when the provider is ordering Clozapine.
  
 CPRS now prevents the user from renewing outpatient and inpatient 
 Clozapine orders.
  
 --Inpatient Clozapine Order Checks - Developers added inpatient Clozapine 
 checks to the ordering process. CPRS now performs an order check when 
 processing a Clozapine order for an inpatient. If the patient fails the 
 check, the user will not be able to enter the Clozapine order. If the 
 patient passes the check, the user will see a message if text has been 
 defined in the OR CLOZ INPT MSG parameter.
  
 --If an Inpatient Order Is DC'd at an Outpatient Location, Print the 
 Order at the Inpatient Location
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to automatically print to the 
 inpatient ward for discontinued (DC) orders if the Nature Order allows 
 printing. Because this is done automatically, the user should not see 
 discontinued orders on the new print form.
  
 Parameter Description Changes
 --Parameter Description Text Expanded - Developers updated descriptions 
 for ORCH CONTEXT MEDS and ORWOR EXPIRED ORDERS in the PARAMETER 
 DEFINITION file, 8989.51, to clarify that ORCH CONTEXT MEDS affects the 
 Meds tab display, but ORWOR EXPIRED ORDERS affects the Orders tab. These 
 parameters function exclusive of each other; changing one does not affect 
 the other.
  
 Patient Record Flags
 --Distinguish the Difference between Category I and Category II Flags - 
 The Patient Record Flag (PRF) Advisory Board requested that CPRS 
 developers enhance the PRF Category I flag display so that it is more 
 distinct than Category II flags. 
  
 Resolution: On the PRF pop-up, developers separated Category I and 
 Category II flag into different lists. Developers made Category I flags 
 more distinct in following ways:
 --Display in a separate section above Category II flags
 --Are first in the tab order
 --Display in larger fonts
 --Background is bright orange
 --The font color is white
 --The Category I title flashes between white and black text
  
 Reports
 --Supplemental Data for Pulse Ox Values on the Reports Tab 
  Four new fields have been added including:
 --Flow Rate (l/min)
 --O2 Concentration (%)
 --Qualifiers
 --Methods
  
 BMI has also been added to the detailed display for weight values, when 
 looking at non-HDR data. This new information will be displayed in the 
 details when the values are clicked on in the grid display of the vitals.
  
 A correction has also been made to the HDR All Outpatient Pharmacy 
 report. Any set of results that has a SIG with a length greater than 60 
 characters will show "[+]" in the corresponding column.
  
 Team Lists
 --Exclude Personal Team Lists from GUI Applications - Previously, when a 
 personal team list was created, it was visible to all users. This created 
 clutter and could cause a breach of confidentiality if all patients on 
 the list had HIV or some similar disease. Simply seeing the list might 
 allow users to know more than they should about a patient.
  
 Resolution: Developers added a new option to the ORLP TEAM MENU named 
 ORLP TEAM LIST VISIBILITY. Personal Team lists can be updated singly or 
 in batch. Visibility options are: OWNER or ALLUSERS. All existing 
 personal lists will be set to OWNER when CPRS v.27 is installed. Owners 
 will need to set those that should be changed to ALLUSERS so that they 
 can be seen. All new lists will be set to OWNER unless designated for 
 ALLUSERS.
  
 Defect Fixes
 =============
 Allergies
 --Automatic Removal of Spaces Causing Mismatched Allergy Items - In some 
 cases, a matching causative agent returned by the allergy search may 
 legitimately contain a trailing space character. CPRS had been stripping 
 any trailing spaces, in which case the causative agent was being stored 
 without the space, causing a failure to match the correct value on file. 
 The mismatch resulted in a free-text entry, and the failure of order 
 checks to fire for these items. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. 
  
 --Remove Default for Value for Observed/Historical (E3R 19668) - 
 Previously, the allergy dialog had a default for whether an allergy was 
 observed or historical. User might not check to ensure that the correct 
 value was selected.
  
 Resolution: Developers removed the default value for the 
 "Observed/Historical" radio button group, and the user will need to 
 select one or the other to complete the entry of the allergy or adverse 
 reaction.
  
 --Users Can No Longer Change the "Originator" on Allergy Entry Dialog - 
 Previously, on the Allergy Entry dialog, the "Originator" defaulted to 
 the user who was logged in, but the user could change the "Originator" to 
 another user. This was not consistent with the List Manager version of 
 the Adverse Reaction Tracking package. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the "Originator" selection 
 continues to default to current user, but is no longer editable.
  
 CCOW
 --CPRS Menu Items Inappropriately Enabled - CCOW menu items for BREAK and 
 REJOIN were being inappropriately re-enabled on every patient change, 
 even if a previous CCOW error had occurred.  
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. If a CCOW error occurs, 
 the Break and Rejoin menu items will remain disabled for the duration of 
 the session. 
  
  
 Consults
 --Consult Selection Not Holding as User Navigates Other Tabs - If a user 
 selected a consult in the consult treeview, and then the user navigated 
 to the Orders tab and placed a new order, the prior consult was no longer 
 selected when the user returned to the Consults tab.  The detailed 
 display window was blank as well. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. 
  
 --Text Wrapping Problem in Consult/Procedure Reason for Request - When a 
 user entered a consult or procedure, the text for the consult/procedure 
 Reason for Request was correctly wrapping at 74 characters, as required 
 to maintain List Manager and File Manager editor compatibility, but hard 
 returns were being inappropriately inserted. This caused the text to 
 break up and have a choppy appearance when saved. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the problem so that the text correctly 
 flows into paragraphs that are still 74 characters wide.
  
 --Users Could Directly Edit or Skip Reason for Request Field When Using 
 Templates - Previously, when a user was ordering a consult, cancelling a 
 template dialog linked to a Reason for Request allowed this field to be 
 edited directly, instead of requiring the entries on the template. 
  
 Resolution: In this version, cancelling out of a template dialog will 
 also abort that order, following user confirmation.
  
 --Canceling Reason for Request Dialog Template Does Not Abort Order 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected two additional scenarios where 
 cancelling a dialog template for a consults reason for request did not 
 correctly abort the order as well.
  
 --REQCOS+7^TIUSRVA Errors (Remedy# 157898, 154177, 155727) - When a user 
 signs a Clinical Procedures class document from the Consults tab, CPRS 
 first checks that all CP-required fields are present. Beginning with CPRS 
 v.26, another check determines whether the expected cosigner is valid as 
 of the date of the document.  In this case, the Delphi variable 
 containing the date was not yet defined, causing the above error on the 
 server. 
  
 Resolution: This has been corrected.
  
 --Access Violation on Consult Copy, Edit, or Quick Order - If a consult 
 copy, edit, or quick order action attempted to load an entry that 
 contained no consult service, an access violation would result.  
  
 Resolution: This has been corrected, displaying instructions to the user 
 that tell them that the order or quick order chosen does not define a 
 consult service and that they should contact their IRM or support staff.
  
 Date/Time Selection
 --Users Can Select an Invalid Time (Remedy #153432) - From the CPRS 
 date/time chooser dialog, the user can choose 00:00 from the time 
 columns.  Since it's unclear what that means in terms of a date, CPRS 
 currently changes it to 00:00:01.  (Similarly, clicking "midnight" enters 
 a time of 23:59.) But then, back on whatever form called this dialog, 
 those seconds are stripped from the time, leaving the time at 00:00, and 
 that's the time that gets used.  
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that selecting an hour of "00" 
 will cause the minutes of "00" to change to "01", making the selection of 
 a "00:00" time impossible. Typing in a "00:00" will result in a value of 
 "00:01" being returned to the calling date box when OK is selected.
  
 Delphi 2006
 CPRS v.27 was coded using Delphi 2006 rather than Delphi 6. That is a 
 change of several versions. As a result, there were changes in CPRS that 
 were related to Delphi changes. The corrections in this section show the 
 problems that developers found in making the change from one version of 
 Delphi to another.
  
 --Delphi 2006 Space Bar Does Not Toggle the Checkbox in Checklist Boxes 
 -Developers made the Space bar once again toggle the checked state in a 
 checklist box.
  
 --Delphi 2006 Drop-down List Items Disappears - When developers placed a 
 drop-down combo box with hints on a form that stayed on top, the 
 drop-down list would quickly disappear after it was opened.  
  
 Resolution: The problem has been resolved.
  
 --Delphi 2006 Problem Deleting CIDC Diagnosis - Users would get an access 
 violation when attempting to remove a diagnosis from the "Assign 
 Diagnoses to Order(s)" dialog. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the issue by coding separate delete 
 function.
  
 Discharge Summary
 --Problems with Users Allowed to Cosign Discharge Summaries - Previously, 
 it was possible for some users who should not have been allowed to cosign 
 discharge summaries to do so. 
  
 Resolution: The complete solution to this problem will probably need to 
 be addressed by role-based user classes, but this will be at a later 
 date. For now, developers reinstated a check for "requires cosignature" 
 document parameter for Discharge Summaries. The check was removed in 
 2001, CPRS v15.7. For the discharge summary user/title, the check looks 
 at the user class of the author and if the author's user class requires 
 cosignature, the author cannot be selected as an expected cosigner.
  
 Encounters
 --Resizing Encounter Form Mistakenly Clears Checkboxes (Remedy #70150) - 
 On the Encounter form, if some of the checkboxes were filled in and the 
 user resized the dialog, CPRS would mistakenly clear the checkboxes.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 --Hover Hint Gives Incorrect Information - A hover hint that said, "To 
 sort, click on column headers", was included on the Encounter form. 
 However, clicking on the column headers does not sort the columns. 
  
 Resolution: The columns in this dialog are not designed to sort. The 
 hover hint has been removed.
  
 --Replace "Environmental Contaminants" Label with "SW Asia Conditions"
 Resolution: As requested, developers changed the term Environmental 
 Contaminants to Southwest Asia Conditions on the Order Signature dialogs. 
 The change was to the display only, no other changes made regarding SW 
 Asia Conditions.
  
 --Provider/Location Dialog: Cursor Does Not Default to Location Field - 
 Remedy ticket 97390 originally reported an issue on this 
 provider/location selection screen.  After fixing that issue, the field 
 requested that for inpatients the cursor should continue to default to 
 provider rather than location. 
  
 Resolution: Developers have changed CPRS and the cursor location for 
 inpatients now defaults to the provider.
  
 --Cursor Defaults to Incorrect Location on Current Activities Dialog 
 (same as Remedy #97390) - In the Current Activities dialog, the cursor 
 does not default to Visit Location field-requiring an additional click 
 from the user to get to the right location. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the cursor now defaults to 
 the Visit Location field for outpatients if the user is a provider.
  
 Graphing
 --Items and Views Now on Separate Tabs
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the graphing display to create two tabs: 
 one for Items that users can select, and one for predefined views.
  
 --Changes to Display of Non-Numerical (Free-Text) Results and Comments
  
 Resolution: Developers improved the display of non-numerical results or 
 data by placing them closest to the graph's top or bottom margin. Values 
 that begin with ">" are displayed at the top of the graph, others are 
 down at the bottom of the graph. By default, free-text values display. 
 This can be toggled by clicking on the label that reads "free-text 
 labels:". Comments are shown with a label that reads "**comment". 
 Clicking on this label will display details of all items on the graph.
  
 --Views Definitions Can Be Displayed
  
 Resolution: Developers added areas on the graphing windows that can show 
 the definitions of views-detailing the items included in the view.
  
 --Users Can Select Lab Groups for a View
  
 Resolution: Users can now select lab groups to graph the items in them.
  
 --Users Can View the Views and Lab Groups of Others
  
 Resolution: Developers added the ability of users to see and use the 
 views and lab groups of other users. 
  
 Imaging
 --Image Flag Added to Windows Messages 
  
 Resolution: Users will not see any changes as a result to this internal 
 change. As requested by the Imaging team, developers added a 1/0 flag to 
 piece 13 of certain Windows messages to indicate the presence/absence of 
 images attached to the report or document. This is in addition to the 
 display of the "image" icon for these items. Other CPRS messages will 
 require API changes by an ancillary application before the flag can be 
 included.  The places that include the NEW messages are as follows. All 
 other places in CPRS will continue to send the OLD messages, without 
 piece 13 set to reflect the presence/absence of images:
   --Consults tab - "Related documents" and med results in the lower 
 treeview.
   --Notes, Discharge Summary tabs - click on any note.
   --Surgery tab - Click on a TIU document.  Clicking on a case will still 
 send the existing messages until an API is updated by Surgery.
   --Reports tab - Imaging (local only), Clinical Reports/Progress Notes.  
 All others will still be the old messages.
  
  
 Labs
 --Display of Lab Time Could Be Misleading (PSI-05-118) - On the Most 
 Recent Labs and Worksheet views, developers changes CPRS to not display a 
 time of "00:00" if Lab entered a result date/time of "T@U", representing 
 an unknown time.  
  
 Resolution: In this version, the same correction has been applied to the 
 dates/times in the "Worksheet" display.  Neither change will be visible 
 to users until associated Lab patch LR*5.2*364 is installed.
  
  
 Launching CPRS
 --Borland .DLL Check Prevents Access Violations - Previously, if a user 
 launched CPRS and an incorrect version of the BORLNDMM.DLL was present, 
 problems such as access violations and other Windows errors could occur.  
  
 Resolution: Developers added code to CPRS to check for the correct 
 version of BORLNDMM.DLL. If the correct version is present, CPRS runs as 
 it should. If the correct version is not present, CPRS displays an error 
 message informing the user and CPRS does not run. 
  
 Lexicon Lookup 
 --Identical Searches Return Different Number of Results (Remedy# 153968) 
 - If the user did consecutive searches for the identical term in the 
 Lexicon lookup dialog (Problems Tab, Consults/Procedures Ordering, 
 Encounter Form, etc.), the search returned a different numbers of 
 results. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that a temporary Lexicon global 
 node that was not being cleared after each search is now cleared. 
  
 Non-VA Meds
 --Non-VA Meds Quick Orders Not Storing the Default Route - When the user 
 created an order and saved it as a Quick Order, the user had defined a 
 route, but when the user then tried to use the quick order, the route was 
 not defined.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this so that the quick order will retain 
 the route.
  
 --Non-VA Meds Synonym Not Displayed beyond Initial Selection - In the 
 Non-VA Meds dialog, providers can select a medication by its generic name 
 or by a synonym (usually the brand name). When the provider selects the 
 medication, the second ordering dialog displayed the generic medication 
 name without the synonym. If the provider selected the wrong medication 
 and was not familiar with the generic name, the provider might not 
 recognize that it was the wrong medication.
  
 Resolution: To address this issue, the Non-VA Meds dialog will display 
 both the generic name and the synonym, instead of the only displaying the 
 generic name. Only the generic name is saved in the order. Therefore, the 
 Orders tab and detailed display were not changed. The second dialog, 
 where the provider enters the rest of the order information, such as 
 dosage, route, and schedule is the only dialog that developers changed.
  
  
 Notes
 --Text Search "List Index Out of Bounds" Error - If a user did a text 
 search in a notes view other than Signed Notes (All), CPRS gave a "list 
 index out of bounds" error. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. There will no longer be an 
 out of bounds error, when doing a text search in other views.
  
 --Problem with Selecting Cosigner and Additional Cosigner (Remedy 
 #129322) - If a user first changed the cosigner, and then added that same 
 individual as an additional signer, the document would be saved with that 
 user as both a cosigner and additional signer. The selected user would 
 then never be able to complete the signature as an additional signer. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the currently selected 
 cosigner cannot be selected as an additional signer.
  
 --User Able to Add Disallowed Author or Cosigner - When a user clicked on 
 the disallowed user from the selection list for either the current author 
 or cosigner, or for an already selected additional signer, CPRS correctly 
 displayed an error message that the selection was not allowed. However, 
 if the user then clicked the "Add" button immediately after the error 
 message, CPRS would still add the disallowed selection to the list. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem; CPRS will not add the 
 inappropriate selection.
  
  
 Notifications
 --Fixing Which Providers Should See "Orders Needing Clarification" Alert 
 (Remedy #69990) - Frequently, the alert for "Orders needing 
 Clarification" was going to providers who were not interested in the 
 alert or could take no action on the alert. 
  
 Resolution: When the user processes the "Orders needing Clarification" 
 alert in CPRS, the list of orders will only include orders where the user 
 is either stored in the Orders file (File 100) as the person identified 
 to see the flagged order or where the user is identified as needing to 
 see the order because of provider recipient rules for the Flagged Order 
 for Clarification Notification.
  
 --Orders Needing Clarification Default Reasons
  
 Resolution: Developers added to the post install routine the default 
 reasons for flagging orders that were identified by the CPRS Clinical 
 Workgroup. The list contains some default reasons, and users can add some 
 free-text to the existing text. 
  
 --Improved Surrogate Validation and Show Comments Button for 
 Notifications - Previously, the comments were only displayed in a hover 
 hint.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the surrogate validation code 
 (Tools/Options/Notifications) to use a new supported Kernel API. 
 Developers also added a Show Comments button to patient selection screen 
 that allows users to display comments added by forwarder when forwarding 
 an alert.  
  
 Orders
 --Orders Custom View Settings Not Being Retained
   --The Orders Custom View selection screen has always opened with all 
 values set to the most generic defaults, instead of to the user's current 
 view settings.  A small change to the settings then requires starting 
 from scratch.  
   --The Status and Service treeviews only highlighted the selected item 
 when the treeview had focus. 
   --There was also an obvious copy/paste error in the code that may have 
 also caused incorrect behavior.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the Custom Order View dialog 
 now opens with the current view settings shown.
  
 --Diet Quick Orders Do Not Prompt for Late Tray (Remedy #69260) - Diet 
 orders, both inpatient and outpatient, prompt for a late tray if the 
 cutoff time has passed for the meal being ordered. If needed, this prompt 
 appears when the user selects the Accept button. For diet quick orders 
 that are designated as "auto-accept", this prompt has never appeared as 
 it should (reported in 2000), resulting in missing late trays for 
 patients.  
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this so that the late tray prompt will 
 display when it should.
  
 --Sequence Problem with Delayed NPO at Midnight and Other Diet Orders 
 (related to PSI-07-212) - For inpatient delayed diet orders, if an "NPO 
 at Midnight" were ordered, followed by any other diet with a start date 
 prior to midnight and no expiration date, the NPO order will be 
 discontinued on release and replaced by the second order. If placed in 
 the reverse sequence, both orders are released correctly and remain in 
 effect.
  
 Resolution: This is not easily corrected, if possible at all, but the 
 user is now prompted about the possible conflict, and instructed on how 
 to prevent it from happening by entering explicit start and stop 
 date/times for any diet orders defined for that same release event. 
 Developers also added code to check for auto-accept diet quick orders, 
 immediate and delayed, that would auto-DC because of overlapping 
 start/stop times. For event-delayed, auto-accept diet quick orders, CPRS 
 checks for conflicting orders for the same release event, and if the user 
 answers NO to the prompt about having adjusted the start/stop dates, CPRS 
 displays the diet order dialog with that quick order pre-loaded so date 
 adjustments can be made.
  
 --Provide a Way to Sort the DC List Sequence (This item is also under 
 "New Parameters")
  
 Resolution: The new parameter OR DC REASON LIST enables someone at a site 
 to define the sequence in which the list of reasons for DC appears in 
 CPRS. The user configuring this list can define the entire list, but does 
 not need to set the entire sequence for every DC reason. For example, if 
 the user wants to have one item listed first, the user can define that 
 item as the first sequence, causing CPRS to load the specified reason 
 first and then load the rest of the DC reasons in alphabetical order.
  
 --Error Message When Attempting to Copy to New Order - In the Recently 
 Expired medications view, some medications that had a status of DC/EDIT 
 were displayed because CPRS had not yet been refreshed. This could cause 
 problems with a provider attempting to copy orders. 
  
 Resolution: Developers made changes to the Orders tab to review the order 
 status and the order action status when determining if the Order Status 
 in CPRS is out-of-sync with the Order Status in VistA. This should 
 correct the problem with CPRS refreshing automatically when trying to 
 copy an order with a status of DC/EDIT. Most likely, the user will 
 receive another message not allowing the copy to happen, with a reason 
 "Orders that have been DC'd due to editing may not be copied."
  
 --Change the Recently Expired Orders View 
  
 Resolution: To prevent duplicate orders-one with a status Expired and one 
 with a status of DC/EDIT from appearing in the Recently Expired Orders 
 view-developers changed this view to look only at the order status and 
 not the order action status. 
  
 --Order Text Cut Off or Missing (Remedy #135126) - Signed On Chart, 
 Discontinue, and Order Verify dialogs could truncate text, or even hide 
 orders on the list, if the maximum number of pixels needed to display the 
 order, in height, exceeded 255.  While more of a problem when using 
 larger fonts, this could also occur for orders with an excessive amount 
 of comments.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed a setting in CPRS that should help 
 alleviate this problem.
  
 --Complex Tab Displays Incorrect Default Schedule - The default schedule 
 loaded from the Pharmacy Orderable Item file was not carrying over to 
 Complex tab.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. The default schedule 
 should carry over correctly.
  
 --Changes to PRN Usage on Complex Order Tab - Previously, the complex 
 orders tab did not display PRN when the schedule field did not have 
 focus. Also, PRN did not display for orderable items when the schedule 
 was a standard schedule with PRN added to it.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the Complex order tab to display PRN in 
 the schedule field when the schedule field is not in focus if the PRN 
 checkbox is checked, and fixed the problem with orderable items not 
 checking the PRN checkbox when the schedule is a standard schedule with 
 PRN added to it.
  
 --IMO Order Schedule Expanding Inappropriately - When copying an IMO 
 order to a new IMO order, the schedule was expanding. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed this because IMO orders should not expand 
 the schedule.
  
 --"Give Additional Dose Now" Checkbox Disappearing - When selecting a 
 schedule in a Complex Inpatient Order dialog, the "Give Additional Dose 
 Now" checkbox disappearing.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 --Limitations Field Shown as Optional 
  
 Resolution: Developers added a message to the Limitations field, stating 
 that the field is optional. (The Limitations field is seen when setting 
 up a Quick Order in VistA.)
  
 --New Parameter for Help Text for Administration Times 
  
 Resolution: CPRS has added the ability to display information describing 
 how to change the administration times. The new parameter OR ADMIN TIME 
 HELP TEXT enables sites to enter text that displays as a Hover Hint on 
 the order dialog's Dosage tab and as an Information Box on the Complex 
 tab. To access this box on the Complex tab, the user must either click or 
 press <Enter> in the administration schedule cells.
  
 --Sig Not Updating after Dosage Edit - Previously, when deleting the 
 first character in the dosage field and closing out of the Order dialog, 
 the sig field did not update to the new dosage. For Example the user 
 enter a dosage of 55 MG by accident they then deleted the first 5 out of 
 the dosage field. The sig field will still show as 55 MG.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. The sig field should now 
 update correctly. 
  
 --REASON FOR FLAG to Display When Processing Flagged Order Alert - When a 
 user is processing a flagged order alert, the REASON FOR FLAG did not 
 display in the order text on the Orders tab. 
  
 Resolution: When a user processes the Flagged Order alert, the REASON FOR 
 FLAG will now display on the Orders tab. It will not display there when 
 not processing notifications. In both cases, the reason will still be 
 included in the order details as it currently is. This functionality now 
 matches CPRS List Manager.
  
 --REASON FOR FLAG Field Changed from Free-Text to Drop-Down List with 
 Free-text Allowed 
  
 Resolution: When a user flags an order, the REASON FOR FLAG field has 
 been changed from a free-text entry to a selection of standard reasons 
 defined by the site in parameter (OR FLAGGED ORD REASONS). Users can 
 append additional free-text to the selected reason, or enter a free-text 
 reason of their own instead of selecting from the list. The field limit 
 is 80 characters.
  
 --Selected Orders Inappropriately Deselected when Right-Clicking (Remedy 
 #70286) - Previously, if a user selected several orders (so that they 
 were highlighted) and then right-clicked on an unselected order, CPRS 
 would deselect the other orders. If the user did not recognize that the 
 selection had changed, the user might take an inappropriate action on an 
 order.
  
 Resolution: If a user selects (highlights) one or more orders and then 
 right-clicks on a different order, CPRS keeps the orders selected and 
 brings up the pop-up menu. This behavior is now consistent with other 
 CPRS tabs.
  
 --Duplicate Personal Quick Order Names - It was possible for a user to 
 enter a new personal quick order name that is a duplicate of an existing 
 quick order name in the same display group type. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. Users can no longer enter 
 a duplicated quick order name for a quick order in the same display group 
 type. CPRS will also prohibit renaming an existing personal quick order 
 to a name that matches an existing entry.
  
 --Dietetics Additional Order Quick Order Error - When using roll and 
 scroll (List Manager) options to create or edit a Dietetics Additional 
 Order quick order, an <UNDEF> error would occur. 
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the Additional orders quick order 
 problem.
  
 --Remove Default Radiology Order Desired Date Default (E3R 19834) - 
 Previously, when a user placed a radiology order, the prompt for Date 
 Desired defaulted to TODAY. 
  
 Resolution: Developers removed this default as requested. This field 
 remains required, but is now displayed with no default. Developers also 
 created patch OR*3.0*281 to identify orders that may need to be changed 
 as a result of new features in some patches. One feature of patch 
 OR*3.0*281 is to identify radiology quick orders with a desired date of 
 TODAY. The patch creates a list of the quick orders with a date of today 
 that will be mailed to the user who runs the report. It can also be set 
 to remove the default of TODAY from the quick orders, and can be set to 
 disregard STAT orders.
  
 --New Clozapine Requirements  
 Resolution: There are some additional requirements for Clozapine 
 ordering. When the user picks an orderable item that points to a 
 Clozapine Pharmacy Orderable Item, the CPRS GUI checks to see if the 
 patient is allowed to get the order based on:
   --registration with the NCCC
   --WBC and ANC lab tests (including the lab values and if the test was 
 within the last 7 days)
   --possibly an override permit from the NCCC.  
  
 If the order can be placed, the user sees nothing new.  
  
 If the order cannot be placed, then a dialog box pops up to show the user 
 the reason.
 CPRS now prevents Clozapine orders from being renewed for both Outpatient 
 and Inpatient orders.
  
 --Discontinuing an Unsigned/Unreleased Delayed Order Required DC Reason - 
 If a user was discontinuing an unsigned/unreleased delayed order, CPRS 
 was asking for a DC reason. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to no longer ask for a DC reason for 
 these types of orders when a user discontinues them. 
  
 --IMO Order Assigned to Incorrect Location - Previously, when was signing 
 IMO orders for a patient who was admitted while the CPRS session was 
 open, the user was prompted to determine where the order should be given. 
 This would cause the order to change the ordering location and the 
 display group. If multiple orders were selected, but the user unchecks 
 some of the IMO orders from the signature list, these orders were 
 inappropriately updating the display group and the ordering location.
  
 Resolution: Developers created a new dialog that CPRS displays when the 
 patient location has changed between inpatient and outpatient, such as 
 when a patient is admitted. The dialog lists the orders and enables the 
 user to pick a location where each order should be administered, such as 
 a clinic location or a ward location.
  
 --Order Marked as Obsolete Still Showing on Active Orders List - In CPRS 
 v.26 (OR*30*215), developers required a signature for discontinued orders 
 that created an order action. In doing so, these orders did not drop off 
 the active orders list as they previously done; the orders remained on 
 the list until the length of time defined in the Context Hrs. 
  
 Resolution: At the recommendation of the CPRS Clinical Workgroup, 
 developers changed CPRS so that discontinued orders now respect the value 
 of the field "INCLUDE IN ACTIVE ORDERS" located in the NATURE OF ORDER 
 file for the order's NATURE OF DC. Orders marked appropriately will now 
 behave as they did before CPRS v.26.
  
 --Truncated or Hidden Labels on Radiology Ordering Dialog - Previously, 
 the "Imaging Type" and "Imaging Procedure" labels were sometimes being 
 truncated or partially hidden on the Radiology ordering dialog, 
 especially on resizing form.  
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem and the labels should 
 appear correctly.
  
 --Schedule Field Behaves Differently when Setting-Up a Quick Order for IV 
 and Unit Dose (Remedy #162977)
  
 Resolution: The schedule field now behaves the same for IV and Unit Dose 
 Orders.
  
 --Quick Order Prompt "Include Patient Instructions in SIG?" Not 
 Functioning Properly (Remedy #69829) - In VistA, when defining a Quick 
 Order, one prompt is the question "Include Patient Instructions in SIG?". 
 The default response is "yes". However, if the user changed the response 
 to "no", closed the dialog, and then began to edit the quick order, the 
 value of this prompt was automatically changed back to "yes". If the user 
 presses <Enter> through the question without changing it, a value of 
 "yes" will be stored.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the code to now retain the value as it has 
 been entered by the user.
  
 --Leading Zero in CPRS Orders and Quick Orders (Remedy #85193) - 
 Previously, when a user entered or edited an order or quick order in 
 CPRS, the VOLUME field stripped off the leading zero. Also, when a user 
 created or edited quick orders in the VistA roll-and-scroll, CPRS would 
 accept a leading zero in the STRENGTH or VOLUME fields before the decimal 
 (0.523), but when the order was placed the leading zero was stripped 
 (.523). In fact, when creating an order or entering or editing a Quick 
 Order in CPRS, the Strength field does no formatting of the entered 
 strength.  For example, if the user enters 00.25 then the value is stored 
 as 00.25.  If they enter .25 then the value is stored as .25. JCAHO 
 compliance states that the volume should have the leading zero.
  
 Resolution: Developers have changed CPRS to not accept orders that begin 
 with a decimal point. Also, if the order is entered with a single leading 
 zero (0.5), the zero will be retained.
  
 --Dose Not Maintained when Placing an Order from Quick Order Menu in 
 VistA (Remedy #137019) -  In VistA, when a user was viewing quick orders 
 through Enter/Edit Quick Orders [ORCM QUICK ORDERS], the text-based dose 
 was  deleted if the user chose to place the order instead of cancel.  
  
 Resolution: The dose is maintained when the user has not changed the text 
 dose.
  
 --Problem When Provider Deletes Comments from Copied or Changed Order 
 (Remedy #160310, 160113) - When a provider copied or changed an order and 
 deleted the comments from the original order, the order was sent to 
 Inpatient Medications with a null entry in ^OR(100-causing Inpatient 
 Medications issues because it tries to send comments to BCMA, but the 
 comments are not there. 
  
 Resolution: CPRS no longer sends a null entry.
  
 --Display of Unsigned Verbal Orders Confusing - Previously, verbal orders 
 that were unsigned displayed on the active orders list, but when a 
 pharmacist changed the order, the changed order replaced the original 
 order. This could cause confusion because the second order showed as 
 needing to be signed, but it was not what was originally entered as a 
 verbal order.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the original unsigned verbal 
 order remains visible to the ordering provider when the order is edited 
 in backdoor pharmacy while in an active status. The action by the 
 pharmacist creates a new order that should display on the Active orders 
 display in CPRS. However, the original order should remain on the 
 Unsigned orders display in CPRS.
  
 --New Parameters Created for Old Unsigned Orders - Instances have 
 occurred where providers have signed old orders accidentally. 
  
 Resolution: To help address the signing of old unsigned orders, 
 developers added two new parameters to the OR namespace: OR LAPSE ORDERS 
 and OR LAPSE ORDERS DFLT. OR LAPSE ORDERS is a numeric parameter that 
 stores the number of days to keep unsigned orders before setting them to 
 the Lapsed status. This parameter is set up such that the instance term 
 is a display group so that different display groups can lapse at 
 different times. OR LAPSE ORDERS DFLT is also a numeric parameter. This 
 parameter stores the number of days before lapsing unsigned orders that 
 are part of a display group that does not have a value set for parameter 
 OR LAPSE ORDERS.
  
 There is now a nightly process that looks at overdue delayed events and 
 lapses orders associated with these events.  Previously, this lapsing 
 only took place during a user session for that event.
  
 --CPRS/Pharmacy HL7 Message Escaping - Prior to these changes, when 
 certain characters were entered in order word processing fields, errors 
 and/or corrupted data could result.
  
 Resolution: CPRS now escapes the HL7 delimiter characters that may be 
 placed in the word processing fields of an order. The escaping is done 
 before the order is handed to Pharmacy so that Pharmacy can parse it and 
 use the data. Pharmacy must in turn un-escape these characters so that 
 they display correctly to the users. Pharmacy also escapes the same 
 characters before sending HL7 messages to CPRS and CPRS un-escapes these 
 before use. 
  
 --Lack of Control in Display of Obsolete Orders - Previously, the INCLUDE 
 IN ACTIVE ORDERS attribute in the NATURE OF ORDER file applied to 
 discontinued orders that did not create an order action (i.e., required a 
 signature). Developers assumed that users would always want to see any 
 discontinued order that had to be signed. At that time, housekeeping 
 types of discontinues (DC's) such as Obsolete did not create an action or 
 get signed, so it was up to the sites to decide if they wanted those DC's 
 to display or not (according to the Context Hrs parameter, as noted) 
 using this Nature attribute. With the change that all front-door DC's 
 create an action, there was no way for sites to make DC's such as 
 obsolete fall off the Orders display right away unless they have their 
 Context Hrs set to 0.
  
 Resolution: Discontinued orders now respect the value for INCLUDE IN 
 ACTIVE ORDERS set in the NATURE OF ORDER file for the nature that was 
 chosen when DCing the order in CPRS, which determines whether the orders 
 will display or not.
  
 --Accidental Signing of Old Orders: Lapsed Report - Previously, there was 
 no way to get a report of orders that had gone into a lapsed status. 
  
 Resolution: This new report provides a way for users to view a list of 
 orders that have been lapsed by the process that determines if orders 
 have been in an unsigned state for too long. The option for this new 
 report is OR LAPSED ORDERS which is an item under the menu option OR 
 PARAM COORDINATOR MENU.
  
 --Days Supply Not Calculating Correctly
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to take into account the conjunctions 
 used on the Complex tab of the Outpatient Meds ordering form when 
 calculating the Days Supply.
  
 --CPRS Needs to Check for Keys for Clozapine Ordering
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to pass the user DUZ to the M system 
 to run a check to see if the provider holds the YSCL Authorized Key.
  
 --Cannot Focus on a Disabled or Invisible Window Message Received when 
 Exiting Medication Order Menus after Order Checks - Previously, if a 
 provider created a complex medication order against an allergy, the Order 
 Check is received, and the provider canceled the order. Then, instead of 
 exiting the order menu via the Quit button, the provider attempted to 
 exit the dialog using the X in top right corner. This action generated an 
 error message. 
  
 Resolution: Developers added code to correct the problem and the user can 
 now exit by clicking the "X" from in the upper right corner of the 
 dialog. 
  
 --Access Violation on Time Out When Day-of-Week Schedule Builder Is Open 
 - Previously, when the Day-Of-Week schedule builder window was open and 
 CPRS timed out, CPRS did not shut down following the countdown to "0" 
 seconds. Instead, an access violation occurred. 
  
 Resolution:  CPRS closes correctly as expected when the timeout is 
 executed while the Day-of-Week form is open.
  
 --Cannot Add the New Allergy Entry/Edit Dialog to the Writer Orders List 
 (Remedy #189377) 
  
 Resolution: User can now add the new allergy entry/edit dialog because 
 developers changed the parameter ORWOR WRITE ORDERS LIST to accept 
 entries of type ACTION in file 101.41. 
  
 --Error When Placing Diet Order for Hospital Location with Null Ward 
 Location (Remedy #187024) - When ordering an inpatient diet, if the 
 current HOSPITAL LOCATION file entry has a null value for WARD LOCATION, 
 an error would result at EN1^FHWOR8.  
  
 Resolution: This is a site data issue. Developers changed CPRS so that 
 the error no longer occurs.
  
 --Personal Quick Orders with Duplicate Names Can Be Saved If the Case Is 
 Different
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 --Problem with Order Status Synchronization in VistA and CPRS - When the 
 user tried to copy an order with a status of DC/EDIT, CPRS would 
 automatically refresh.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the Orders tab to review the order status 
 and the order action status when determining if the Order Status in CPRS 
 is out-of-sync with the Order Status in VistA. Generally, CPRS will not 
 allow the copy to happen, and will display a message to the user stating 
 that "Orders that have been DC'd due to editing may not be copied." CPRS 
 should not refresh if the order status in the GUI is DC/EDIT.
  
 --Delayed A/D/T Orders Show Global Value in Location Field - When placing 
 an A/D/T delayed order for an outpatient and a location is not selected 
 before writing a delayed order. CPRS currently display "0;sc(" in the 
 location column for the order. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS to display "Unknown" instead of 
 "0;sc(" in the location column.
  
 --Duplicate Order Forms Opening in CPRS - If a user double-clicked on an 
 item in the Write Orders list, two of the same order dialog would open.
  
 Resolution: Speedy double-clicking should no longer open multiple order 
 forms.
  
 --IMO Clinic Determination
  
 Resolution: To help determine if a location is an authorized IMO 
 location, CPRS calls to a scheduling database when the user begins 
 writing orders. However, if for some reason, the database cannot be 
 reached, the new RSA returns a -3 value (which tells CPRS it could not be 
 reached). CPRS then checks the Hospital Location entry to see if that 
 entry is marked as an IMO location. If the location is marked as an IMO 
 location, then CPRS allows the user to place IMO orders.
  
 --Detailed Order Display Change
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the Order Detail display to read 
 "Released:" and the date instead of "Released by: on" and the Date if the 
 Signed on Chart field is not checked. 
  
 --Changed the Sequence Button on the Complex Order Dialog to a Drop-Down 
 List
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the Then/And button to a drop-down list. 
 This should improve how the information is entered.
  
 --Refill Field Allows Inappropriate Numbers, Letters and Characters - 
 Previously, users could enter inappropriate numbers, letters, and 
 character into the Refill field and then CPRS sent them to pharmacy
  
 Resolution: The order dialog now performs a check when accepting an 
 order. If the refill value is anything other then a number, then CPRS 
 displays an error message, and the user will not be able to complete the 
 order.
  
 --Refills to Days Supply Are Not Checked when an Order Is Changed (Remedy 
 185499) - This Remedy ticket had two problems. When placing an outpatient 
 order with refills, if the user changed the order before signing the 
 order, the refill value would display as zero in the order dialog, and 
 the user was not able to change the refill value until something else was 
 changed in the order.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected these issues. When the user is placing 
 an order, CPRS performs a more detailed check to stop order from being 
 placed with a refill value greater then the max possible refills.
  
 --Admin Times Display as NOT DEFINED on Personal QO Created from a VistA 
 QO - When the user created the QO from one containing a Day-of-Week 
 schedule built from the hours and minutes list instead of the schedule 
 combo box, the administration times did not come through on the personal 
 quick order.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this and the administration times come 
 through as they should.
  
 --Personal Quick Order Not Saved When Created from an Existing VistA QO - 
 When a user created a personal quick order (QO) from an existing 
 Inpatient mediation quick order created in VistA, the personal quick 
 order did not display in the Unit Dose list.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 --IV Medication Order Dialog Clicking Off Solution or Additive List 
 Automatically Adds Med To Order
  
 Resolution: Developers addressed this problem and clicking someplace else 
 or tabbing out of the solution or additives lists no longer automatically 
 adds the Medication to the order.
  
 --Text Box Not Read-Only when It Should Be - Previously, on the Inpatient 
 and Outpatient Meds order dialogs, after the user selected a medication, 
 and the complete dialog is displayed, the user could clear part of the 
 medication name from the text box at the top of the screen, using the 
 backspace or delete keys, or by selecting part of the text and typing 
 other characters.  The result would be a change that should not be 
 allowed.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the text box to be read-only.  Only the 
 navigation keys are recognized in the edit box. To change the medication 
 name, the user must select the Change button.
  
 --Newly Created Personal Quick Order Are NOT Accessible - A problem was 
 found with saving Inpatient quick order (QO) to a personal QO. This was 
 caused by a difference with the display groups the QO were being saved 
 to. Developers found that quick orders with the display group Inpatient 
 Medications were not being displayed in the list of quick orders on the 
 Inpatient Medications dialog where users were accustomed to seeing them. 
  
 Resolution: To correct this problem, developers removed the default 
 dialog from the Inpatient Medication Display Group. This display group 
 will now only be used as a grouper for Custom Order Views for Inpatient 
 Medications. Sites will no longer be able to use the Inpatient Medication 
 as a Type of Quick Order when creating a QO in VistA. Sites will need to 
 use the Unit Dose Medication value for the Type of Quick Order when 
 setting up a QO in VistA. A post install routine will change any existing 
 quick orders that are defined with a Type of Quick Order of Inpatient 
 Medications to a Type of Quick Order of Unit Dose. Doing this will keep 
 the interface the same for CPRS users.
  
 Order Checks
 --Order Checks and Reason for Override Not Sent to Ancillary Packages
  
 Resolution: Developers added an API to communicate order checks and 
 reason for override to ancillary packages.
  
 --Order Check Consistency
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the Inpatient Order dialog to do the same 
 look-up for the Common Drug information as the outpatient dialog. This 
 should allow for the same order check information to appear as an 
 outpatient order, when accepting an inpatient order.
  
 --Order Checking Screen Cannot be Resized
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this: the order checking screen (dialog) 
 can now be resized.
  
 Parameter Description Changes
 --Parameter Description Text Expanded
 Resolution: Developers updated descriptions for ORCH CONTEXT MEDS and 
 ORWOR EXPIRED ORDERS in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file, 8989.51, to 
 clarify that ORCH CONTEXT MEDS affects the Meds tab display, but ORWOR 
 EXPIRED ORDERS affects the Orders tab. These parameters function 
 exclusive of each other; changing one does not affect the other.
  
 Patient Demographics
 --Incorrect data on Patient Inquiry Report (from CPRS) (PSI-05-063, 
 Remedy #102307) - To get patient demographics, a user can click once on 
 the Patient Inquiry button. Previously, if a user double-clicked on the 
 Patient Inquiry button and was changing patients, it was possible to get 
 incorrect information. This happened infrequently. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that double-clicking on the 
 Patient Info button (located on the patient bar) will no longer open 
 multiple dialogs. As a result, users will not see incorrect patient data 
 in this box, due to double-clicking, and switching patients.
  
 --Display of Added Demographic Information
  
 Resolution: When the user selects the Patient Inquiry button, developers 
 enhanced CPRS to display the secondary Next of Kin information, the 
 Emergency contact, and the patient's cell phone number. This data comes 
 from a registration (DG) Application Programming Interface (API).
  
 Patient Insurance Dialog
  
 --Patient Insurance Dialog Formatting Problem - Previously, the patient 
 name next to the dialog title might not be viewable. 
  
 Resolution: Developers made a change in CPRS on the dialog title to 
 eliminate leading spaces between the title and the patients name to 
 ensure that the patient's name is viewable.
  
 Patient Record Flags
  
 --Difficulty Changing PRF Note Title, Date, Author, Etc. - With unsigned 
 PRF progress notes, users could not change the note characteristics: 
 title, author, date. 
  
 Resolution: Developers fixed this problem and users can now change the 
 date, author, etc. of an unsigned PRF progress note. 
 Note:   If the user attempts to change the characteristics of a PRF note 
 and has highlighted an action that reads Yes under note, CPRS assumes 
 that the user is trying to link to an already linked action and will not 
 allow the change to continue. However, if the user removes the highlight 
 from the Yes action, the changes can occur.
  
 Patient Selection
  
 --Provider Selecting Wrong Patient with Same First/Last Name (PSI-04-057, 
 NOIS BHH-1104-40049, Remedy #71065) - On the patient selection screen, if 
 a user typed in some letters of a patient's name, CPRS would try to match 
 the selection, go to that part of the patient list, and highlight the 
 first entry that matched the text entered-even if there was more than one 
 possible match. If the user pressed <Enter> without ensuring that the 
 correct patient was selected, the user might be looking at the wrong 
 record.
  
 Resolution: To address this problem, developers changed the patient 
 selection list to implement the same auto-unique selection behavior that 
 the mediation order dialog dosage, route, and schedule implements. 
 Specifically, an item in the list will not be selected unless the text 
 typed uniquely identifies the item. If there are multiple items that 
 could match what the user entered, CPRS requires the user to explicitly 
 select the patient.
  
 --Button Display Issue on the Patient Selection Dialog 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the code so that the Save Patient List 
 Settings button should no longer get cut off.
  
 Problem List
  
 --New Problem Dialog: Manual Resizing Breaks Up Part of Display
  
 Resolution: Manual resizing does not break up the display.
  
  
 Reminder Dialogs
  
 --All Items in a Group Can Now Be Required (Remedy #128569) 
  
 Resolution: Along with patch PXRM*2.0*4 and the changes in CPRS GUI v.27, 
 users can now force all the items in a Reminder Dialog Group to be 
 required.
  
 --Additional Text in Progress Notes for Inexact Date Entered in Reminder 
 Dialog (Remedy #141382)
  
 Resolution: When the user enters a vague historical date in a Reminder 
 Dialog, the progress note text will append "exact date unknown" next to 
 the date.
  
 Remote Data Views (RDV)
  
 --RDV Not Displaying Units Consistently - Previously, the RDV reports did 
 not display units in the comment section for site-to-site items, but HDR 
 items did have units
  
 Resolution: RDV displays units consistently for both data from the HDR 
 and the site-to-site data.
  
 Reports
  
 --Missing Image Icons and Incorrect Messages on Radiology Reports - 
 Previously on the Reports tab, radiology reports listed under "Clinical 
 Reports/Radiology/Imaging" were not displaying an image icon if images 
 were attached, as they did for the identical reports under "Imaging 
 (local only)". Additionally, if a report did have linked images, CPRS 
 displayed the incorrect message "Imaging links are not active at this 
 site" at the top of the report text when the user clicked on that report 
 in the list.  Behind the scenes, Windows messaging used by VistA Imaging 
 was also not behaving correctly for these reports.  
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected all of these issues.
  
 --Two Reports Missing Schedule Data - Two reports in CPRS, All IV and 
 Active IV were missing schedule data. 
  
 Resolution: Developers added a new Schedule column to the reports and 
 changed the column order. The order is now: Additives, Solutions, Rate, 
 Schedule, Start Date/Time, Stop Date/Time,  [+]Flag.
  
  
 Sensitive Patient Checks
  
 --Sensitive Record Check Bypassed when Using CPRS GUI to Process Alerts 
 (Remedy #215189, NSOC Ticket #VA08853) - Previously, if a user was 
 processing alerts, CPRS did not perform a sensitive record check before 
 going to the patient chart. This has never worked correctly. The user was 
 taken to the chart without receiving the sensitive patient warning. There 
 are two known issues remaining, both occur only when an alert cannot be 
 processed at all because viewing that patient is denied:
  
 1. If that alert is the first in the list to be processed, then following 
 the "access denied" message, the patient selection screen will open, and 
 any subsequent alerts that the user had previously selected will need to 
 be selected again.
  
 2.  In any other sequence, alerts up to and including the "access denied" 
 message will process correctly. At that point, the user cannot continue 
 processing alerts using the NEXT button or menu, and must go back to the 
 patient selection screen to continue, or reselect additional alerts.
  
 Signature
  
 --Review/Sign Changes Dialog Incorrectly Identifying Some Orders as 
 "Non-VA" Orders - CPRS was treating generic text orders containing the 
 text of "Non-VA Meds" as Non-VA Meds orders on the Review/Sign Changes 
 form. As a result, the checkbox on the Review/Sign Changes was grayed out 
 for this order, and the user could not uncheck the order so that it would 
 not be signed.  
  
 Resolution: For signature, CPRS now checks the display group of the order 
 instead of the order text.
  
 --Redundant Display of "Review/Sign Orders Dialog - Previously, if a 
 patient had unsigned items, and the user selected "File/Select" to open a 
 different patient's chart, and then processes an alert from the patient 
 selection screen, CPRS displayed the Review/Sign Changes dialog. The 
 second instance, after selecting the alert, was redundant.
  
 Resolution: Developers prevented the dialog from displaying the second 
 time.
  
 --Other Users' Orders Appearing under the Current User's Signature List - 
 When a user was exiting a patient record that contained unreleased orders 
 written by other user and the current user did not write any orders CPRS 
 was inappropriately placing the other users' orders in the current user's 
 signature list.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. The order will now appear 
 in the correct section of the signature list.
  
 --Users Not Prompted to Sign Allergy Entered in Error Note when Exiting
  
 Resolution: All allergies entered in error and allergies that create 
 progress notes will require a signature and be listed on the signature 
 form along with orders.
  
 --Associating Orders with a Clinic or Ward when Patient Location Changes 
 during Ordering Session - Previously, if a user began writing orders for 
 an outpatient and during the ordering session, the patient was admitted, 
 CPRS enabled the user to decide where the group of orders should be 
 sent-the ward or the clinic. However, this choice seemed to limit the 
 users to only moving all orders to a single location even though the user 
 might want some orders given in one location and others in the other 
 location. 
  
 Resolution: To add more flexibility, developers changed the dialog to 
 enable the user to send all orders to either the ward or the clinic or to 
 individually associate some orders with the ward and others with the 
 clinic.
  
 Templates 
  
 --Refresh Button Allows All Patient Data Objects to Appear - When users 
 create or edit a template, selecting Edit | Insert Patient Data (Object) 
 brings up a list of patient data objects (TIU Objects) that the user can 
 put into the template. This list can be restricted by the TIU TEMPLATE 
 PERSONAL OBJECTS parameter by specifying which patient data objects will 
 appear in this list. The Refresh button on this form bypasses this 
 parameter restriction and adds all patient data objects to the list.  
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem; the parameter value will 
 be respected.
  
 --Template Searches Seem to Make CPRS Freeze - Previously, when users 
 searched for a template with the Find Template feature, either in the 
 template editor or in the templates drawer, the search could take an 
 inordinate amount of time and make it appear that CPRS was frozen. 
  
 Resolution: CPRS developers added a dialog that displays when a search 
 takes longer than a second or two. The dialog has a search animation (a 
 moving flashlight) to show the user that CPRS is still searching. From 
 this form, the user can also cancel the search using the Cancel button if 
 the search is taking too long. Also, searches for templates higher up in 
 the template tree should be considerably faster.
 User Interface
  
 --Double-Clicking on Controls Creating Problems - Previously, if a user 
 double-clicked on controls of some mental health tests, CPRS was 
 experiencing problems, such as access violations. The problem appeared to 
 be a latency problem, where the clicks were viewed as two separate clicks 
 rather than a double-click. The problem appeared to be related to system 
 response, and possibly the use of regional data processing centers.
  
 Resolution: Developers made changes to CPRS to disable the Mental Health 
 Test buttons, Clear, Cancel, and Finish buttons in reminder dialogs to 
 disable after the first click and it will not become enable until the 
 code is finish processing. 
 508 and Sizing Issues
  
 --Consults Reason for Request Box Not Expanding Vertically 
  
 Resolution: The Reason for Request field on the Consult dialog now 
 expands vertically when the dialog increases in size.
  
 --"Transfer Medication Orders" Pop-Up Window Does Not Display OK and 
 Cancel Buttons with Fonts >10 Pt 
  
 Resolution: The OK and Cancel buttons will now display with 10 point and 
 larger font sizes.
  
 --Notes Tab - JAWS Not Reading Text Correctly in the Custom View Dialog
 Resolution: Developers changed the text on the Note Tree View and Sort 
 Note List above the Sort Order radio buttons so that they display the 
 same information as the group box above them. Now JAWS will read the same 
 information.
  
 --Assign Diagnoses Dialog - Difficult Keyboard Navigation
  
 Resolution: The Assign Diagnoses to Orders(s) dialog has been changed to 
 improve accessibility.
  
   --The focus will no longer land on the labels above each of the 
 controls, and the labels will still be read by screen readers.
   --The initial focus on the form is now obviously in the top list 
 control.
  
 --Notes Change Button Causes Problems with Larger Fonts (Remedy #135118) 
 - When using larger fonts, and editing a note, the Change button used to 
 change the note title, author, etc., moves to the left, covering up the 
 note title or other relevant data, or the Change button could completely 
 disappear.  
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem so that the Change button 
 remains on the right side of the screen regardless of the font size.
  
 --Dialog Display Problems in Windows XP Style (Remedy #71192) - When the 
 workstation desktop is in Windows XP Style or when using Large or Extra 
 Large fonts on the desktop, Windows expands the title bar of all windows. 
 This expansion may cause scroll bars to appear on some dialogs, hiding or 
 even making some components inaccessible.  These scroll bars would not 
 appear when Windows Classic Style and Normal Font Size are used.  
  
 Resolution: Developers added checks in CPRS to detect an enlarged title 
 bar and lengthen the height of the dialog accordingly, to prevent these 
 scroll bars from appearing on these dialogs.
  
 --Large Font Sizes Create Problems in Dialogs (Remedy # 70821) - When 
 using larger fonts on some dialogs, the components on those dialogs would 
 grow to a larger size than the dialog itself, making them unusable.  Some 
 dialogs affects included the signature box when completing orders, and 
 the lookup of other immunizations, skin tests, patient education topics, 
 and exams on the encounter form.  It is likely that there are other 
 dialogs that were corrected as a result of this fix as well.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 --CPRS Display Problems with Alternate Color Schemes (Remedy # 119059) - 
 When Windows is set to display in alternate color schemes, particularly 
 when windows and buttons are black, many locations throughout CPRS do not 
 accommodate the color change, making it difficult to use. 
  
 Resolution: CPRS will now automatically adjust text colors and black 
 button images when windows are black, when using alternate color schemes. 
  
 Note:   Graphing colors are not adjusted. Also, CPRS will not adjust well 
 to color scheme changes made while CPRS is running.
  
 --Provider Selection Using Keyboard Difficult on the Encounter Form's 
 Procedure Tab (Remedy # 70301) - Using the keyboard to select a provider 
 on the Procedures tab of the Encounter Form was extremely difficult. 
 After only a half second of typing, typed text was used to select the 
 provider, with additional typed text restarting the provider selection. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed this so that when the user types some 
 text, CPRS searches for a possible match. If it finds a partial match 
 (names that contain part of what was typed), the text remains in the 
 field and the user can continue to type or use the down arrow to find the 
 correct name. If there is no partial match, the field returns to blank or 
 the previous name.
  
 --Focus Should Remain on Tab When Navigating using the Keyboard - When 
 navigating the tabs on the Encounter form, the focus would go to the 
 first control on each tab. This made it difficult for sight-impaired 
 users to know which tab they were on.
  
 Resolution: The focus now stays on the tab rather than jumping to the 
 first control on the tab's page.
  
 --Problem Selecting Items from List Boxes - When users attempted to check 
 the selected diagnosis code using the keyboard, the cursor does not check 
 the item, but goes somewhere else. A list box that allowed a user to type 
 some text to go to a portion of the list items (such as typing "m" to go 
 to the first m item in the list, "macular degeneration" for example) 
 would not keep the focus on the "macular degeneration" item if the user 
 pressed the Up arrow, Down arrow, or Space bar on the item.
  
 Resolution: Now the focus will activate (check for check list boxes) the 
 correct item when pressing the Space bar or move to the correct item when 
 pressing the Up or Down arrow keys.
  
 --Screen reader Does Not Read Contents of Service Connection and Rated 
 Disabilities Box
  
 Resolution: The focus now starts at the beginning of the Service 
 Connection and Rated Disabilities box, enabling the user of the screen 
 reader to easily arrow down or instruct their screen reader to read the 
 text.
  
 --Encounter Form--Service Connection and Rated Disabilities Box Should Be 
 Made Uneditable
  
 Resolution: The Service Connection & Rated Disabilities box is no longer 
 editable.
  
 --Text Only Order Dialog OK/Cancel Buttons Hidden at 18 pt Font
  
 Resolution: The OK & Cancel buttons should no longer be hidden at 18 pt 
 font.
  
 --Hover Hints on the Other Examinations Window Now Left Justified at 
 Fonts Sizes 18 and 24 - The Other Examinations dialog (accessed from the 
 encounter forms "exams" tab.) contains a list box. The list box hover 
 hints are now left justified at font sizes 18 and 24. 
  
 Resolution: The upgrade to Delphi 2006 caused this improvement.
  
 --Fix Sorting of Alerts on Patient Selection Screen with Keyboard (Remedy 
 #70891) - Previously CPRS supported only ascending sorting of alerts on 
 the Patient Selection screen when using the keyboard.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the problem and users can now toggle 
 between ascending and descending sorts on alerts, using the keyboard, on 
 the Patient Selection screen.  
  
 --508: Difficulty in Accessing Unique Problem List Entries from Encounter 
 Form - If a list contained an item beginning with a space, when the user 
 pressed the Space bar, CPRS would move to the first item that began with 
 a space and immediately select the item also (when using the keyboard, 
 user press the Space bar to select items in a list). This meant that it 
 was impossible for keyboard users to select any other item than the one 
 beginning with the space.
  
 Resolution: Now pressing the Space bar will not jump to items that begin 
 with a space. The Space bar is reserved for selecting items so that the 
 user will now be able to select other items in the list when using a 
 keyboard.
  
 --508: Inconsistency in Checking Diagnosis Code - Previously, on the 
 Encounter form's Diagnoses tab, it was sometimes necessary for the user 
 to arrow down off a specific code and then and back up to the code before 
 the code could be checked.
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. CPRS now functions 
 correctly. Using the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys and pressing the Space 
 key keeps the user on the correct item in the list.
  
 --508: Notes Tab-Add Encounter to Action Menu
  
 Developers added the Encounter menu item to the Action Menu on the Notes 
 tab and included a short cut: Shift+Ctrl+R.
  
 --508: Encounter Form-Need short-cut to Get to the CANCEL Button
  
 Resolution: "ALT+C" activates the CANCEL button.
  
 --508: Encounter Form-Need short-cut to Get to the OK Button 
  
 Resolution: "ALT+O" on the encounter form activates the OK button.
  
 --508: Put Add and Remove Buttons on the Consults Send Alert Dialog
  
 Resolution: Developers put Add and Remove on the Consult Actions Send 
 Alert dialog.
  
 --508: When Shift-Tabbing Out of the Encounter Information, a "Cannot 
 Focus Error" Occurs
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the "Cannot focus" error that occurred 
 when a user shift-tabbed out of the Encounter read-only text field on the 
 Notes tab.
  
 --508: Encounter Form Navigation-Tab Should List Selected Section Entries 
 - Previously, the tab order for moving the focus in the dialog was 
 confusing to those using screen readers. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the tab order on the following Encounter 
 form tabs: Diagnoses, Procedures, Immunizations, Skin Tests, Patient Ed, 
 Health Factors, and Exams. Each of these tabs contains an Other button; 
 the Other button has been put in the tab order after the section name 
 list (after the Modifiers list on the Procedures tab).
  
 --508: When Reviewing/Checking Questions in the Classification Questions, 
 Screen Readers Do Not Read Cursor Location
  
 Resolution: Each check box will now read the group box title: "Visit 
 Related To" and then the value it is related to like "Agent Orange 
 Exposure" and then if the check box is a yes check box it will read: "- 
 Yes", and for no it will read: "- No".
  
 --508: Consults Tab - Change Cursor Location for Action Menu - Alt-A-C-T 
 - JAWS 
  
 Resolution: When activating the menu option: Actions | Consult Tracking | 
 Display Details (Alt-A-C-T), CPRS now places the focus into the text 
 field containing the details, the screen reader reads that it is in a 
 text field, and the user can review the details.
  
 --508: Location for Current Activities Tab - JAWS - The Location for 
 Current Activities dialog has 3 tabs within it. When a user Alt-tabbed or 
 arrow-keyed through the tabs, sometimes focus is thrown onto a control 
 within the tab area, making it difficult to navigate. 
  
 Resolution: Now when the user navigates using the keyboard (with the Tab 
 or arrow keys), the focus will remain on tab name, so that the screen 
 reader will read the tab name, making navigation easier.
  
 --508:  Blind Users Can Only Select One Order at a Time - Previously, 
 visually impaired users and those who use the keyboard exclusively could 
 not select more than one order unless the orders were next to each other 
 in a list.
  
 Resolution: Multiple orders that are not in a row (not contiguous) can 
 now be selected using the keyboard only. The functionality mimics 
 Outlook's email list. To move the focus without selecting an order, the 
 user should press and hold the Ctrl key and then use the arrow keys. To 
 select an order when the focus is on it, press the Space bar. To select 
 another order, continue to hold the Ctrl key and press the arrow key to 
 move focus to the next order you want to select, then still holding the 
 Ctrl key, press Space bar-the new and the previous order will be selected.
  
 --508 : Notes Tab - Action Menu (Alt-A-G) Sign Order Dialog Text Now 
 Accessible
  
 Resolution: The notes sign orders dialog (Alt-A-G) has been modified so 
 that the text displayed above the signature code box can be accessed via 
 the keyboard. JAWS will be able to read the text when the user tabs into 
 the text.
  
 --508: Consults - Press <Enter> Key to Begin a New Consult
  
 The New Consult button is now the default button on the Consults tab. 
 When the user first gets to the Consults tab and presses <Enter> the 
 button will be "clicked" (the Order a Consult dialog displays).
  
 --508:  Tabbing Access to Patient Inquiry from Notes Tab Is Problematic 
 and Inconsistent
  
 Resolution: Developers changed the tab order on the Notes tab. The 
 Patient Inquiry can now be accessed consistently on the Notes tab by 
 tabbing and shift-tabbing.
  
 --508: Treatment Factor Definition Pop-Ups Not Read by Screen Readers
  
 Resolution: When a screen reader is running, the treatment factor labels 
 now appear as read only edit fields. The read only fields contain the 
 text displayed by the pop-up. The user can use their "read in" keys to 
 read the text; this makes the data available for screen reader users.
  
 --508:  Create Standardized Shortcuts for Use Throughout CPRS
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that now as a general rule "Ctrl + 
 Enter" will activate (click) the default button on a dialog. Default 
 buttons are typically labeled "Ok", "Done", or "Accept" Not all dialogs 
 and windows have default buttons assigned.  If no default exists for the 
 dialog or window, "Ctrl + Enter" will not activate any button on those 
 forms.
  
 --508: Orders Tab   Would Like to Press the <Enter> key to "Accept Order" 
 - Pressing the <Enter> key on most order dialogs moves the focus from one 
 control to the next. So <Enter> had conflicting functionality. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that if the user presses "Ctrl + 
 Enter" on an order dialog it will activate the Accept button.
  
 --508: Encounter Form Inaccessible:  CPRS Does Not Track Focus and Focus 
 Changes - Specifically, users reported that on the Encounter form's Visit 
 Type tab, there were two places where the focus would get "lost". The 
 first instance occurred when the user tabbed or shift-tabbed between SC & 
 Rated Disabilities box and the Visit Related To groupbox. The other 
 instance of "lost" focus occurred only when the user shift-tabbed from 
 the Available providers combo box.
  
 Resolution: The focus will no longer be "lost" to adaptive technologies 
 on the Encounter form. 
  
 --508: Problems Tab - Default OK so that Pressing <Enter> Key Selects Term
  
 Resolution: Now pressing the <Enter> key on the New Problem dialog will 
 activate the OK button.
  
 --508:  Notifications - Create Keystrokes for "Go to the Next 
 Notification", Continue, Forward and Renew - When processing multiple 
 notifications in CPRS, there is a small hand pointing to the right in the 
 lower right hand section of CPRS. Clicking on the hand means "go to the 
 next notification" automatically. There was no keystroke for this option. 
 Neither are there keystrokes for the pop-up menu items Continue, Forward, 
 and Renew. 
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the user can now tab to the 
 "Next Hand" or "go to the next notification" button, or the user can 
 access it by pressing ALT+ N. All of the pop-up menu options are now 
 available using short-cut keys: Continue = CTRL+C, Forward = CTRL+F, and 
 Renew = CTLR+R.
  
 --Splash Screen--Fix the Email Address on the Splash Screen
  
 Resolution: Changed to email address from med.va.gov to va.gov.
  
 --508: Can't Tab Through Multi-Tab Screens
  
 Resolution: The user can now move to the next tab using the left and 
 right arrow keys.
  
 --508: At Fonts 12, 14, 18 Display of Problem List Items under Diagnosis 
 Section Are Unreadable
  
 Resolution: All font sizes are now readable.
  
 --508 Consults--Splitter Bar Doesn't Retain Size
 Resolution: Developers removed code that was resizing left panel to the 
 same size- overriding the user set size.
  
 --Patient Selection Screen: Sizing Issues - Previously, when the user 
 resized the Patient Selection Screen some buttons did not resize properly
 .
 Resolution: Developers changed the dialog so that the Save Patient 
 Listing Settings button width and height correctly adjust based on form 
 text length and height.
  
 --508:  Scroll Bar Disappears on Notes/Consults and DC Summary Tabs with 
 Larger Fonts (Remedy #70539)
  
 Resolution: The scroll bars remain visible when using larger fonts.
  
 --508:  Create a Custom Component to Read a Label that the User Can Tab To
  
 A component has been created that will allow Delphi developers to place a 
 label that can gain focus when a screen reader is running. This will 
 allow free standing single line labels to be read.
  
 --508:  Some Labs Grids Not Reading Correctly - Previously, the labs grid 
 that CPRS displays after the user selects "Most Recent Results" or 
 "Worksheet" does not read the data correctly.
  
 Resolution: Developers worked on the labs grid for the "Most Recent 
 Results" and "Worksheet" displays so that it reads the whole row, 
 including headers, as the user arrows around in the grid.
  
 --508:  Clinical Reminders and Reminder Categories on Cover Sheet Dialog
  
 Resolution: The dialog "Clinical Reminders and Reminder Categories 
 Displayed on Cover Sheet" now is accessible through a screen reader, with 
 the exception of reading the graphics. The graphics are going to be 
 handled globally with another correction.
  
 --508: JAWS Does Not Speak the State of Template and Reminder Drawers - 
 Previously, the Templates and Reminders drawer buttons would speak their 
 names, but they did not speak whether they were opened or closed.
  
 Resolution: On the Notes, D/C Summary, or Consults tabs, or any other tab 
 where they are found, when the Templates and Reminders buttons are 
 pressed or receive focus, the screen reader will now indicate the state 
 of the drawer.  For example, when a closed templates drawer button 
 receives focus, the screen reader will say "Templates Drawer, drawer 
 closed".  When the button is pressed, the screen reader will say "drawer 
 open".
  
 --508: Users Not Told that Text Was Inserted into Documents
  
 Resolution: When a user is working with any kind of document (note, 
 consult, etc.) and a boilerplate, template, or reminder dialog inserts 
 text into that document, the screen reader will say "text inserted".
  
 --508: Dialogs Not Identified
  
 Resolution: When a dialog appears, the screen reader will say the word 
 "Dialog" following the title of the dialog.
  
 --508: JAWS Does Not Read Day of Week (DOW) Schedule
  
 Resolution: If JAWS is running, the user should be able to read the DOW 
 schedule at the end of the DOW schedule form. 
  
 --508: JAWS Not Reading Order Dialog Fields
  
 Resolution: If JAWS is running, the user should be able read the 
 Administration Times and the Expected First Dose time on the Unit Dose 
 Order dialog and the IV Order Dialog.
  
 --508: Add Keyboard Combination for OK Button
  
 Resolution: Developers set the OK button as the default for when the user 
 presses the keyboard combination <Ctrl> + <Enter>. When the user presses 
 <Ctrl> + <Enter>, the OK button is activated.
  
 --508: Notifications Headings Not Displayed Correctly at Higher Font Sizes
  
 Resolution: Developers adjusted the Notification heading sizes to 
 accommodate 14pt font.
  
 --508:  Template Field Combo Boxes Do Not Retain Their Values (Remedy 
 #70463) - Previously in Reminder dialogs, if the user entered values with 
 keystrokes without the list dropping down, the values were not retained.
  
 Resolution:  Values chosen using key strokes are being selected and saved.
  
 --508: Notifications Selecting Provider to Forward Does Not Work with 
 Keyboard - Previously, if the user was forwarding a notification to 
 another provider, the user could not type the name in the search box and 
 press <Enter> to have the name moved to the recipient list. Pressing 
 <Enter> closed the dialog, and if a name was not selected, no action was 
 taken.
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS so that the keystrokes now work as 
 they should. The user can type a name, press <Enter>, and the name will 
 go to the recipient list.
  
 --508: Encounter Area under Note Text Pane Does Not Have a Label
  
 Resolution: Developers added the following label for JAWS: "Encounter 
 Information" to the Encounter text area under the Note text pane. (This 
 change can only be listened for.)
  
 --508: Focus Always Returns to Upper Left Item in Page - Previously on 
 several CPRS tabs, when a used navigated CPRS with the keyboard and 
 performed certain actions, the focus would return to the upper left item 
 on the tab. The upper left item was not always the most useful place and 
 at times required a lot of tabbing and navigation to return to the cursor 
 or focus to the appropriate item.
  
 Resolution: After opening a dialog and closing it - as a general rule - 
 the focus will return to where it was.
  
 --508: Orders Tab - Order Selection Does Not Keep Its Focus
  
 Resolution: The focus will stay on the order list after performing an 
 action on an order.
  
 --508: Cancel Button on Patient Selection Screen Lower Border Is Not 
 Displaying 
  
 Resolution: The bottom of the Cancel button is no longer cut off.
  
 --508: Charleston Issue #2:  OK and Cancel Button Disappear on 
 Discontinue / Cancel Orders Form (PSI-05-006)
  
 Resolution: The buttons will no longer be inaccessible by shrinking the 
 size of the dialog.
  
 --508: Encounter Form Inaccessible: CPRS Does Not Track Focus and Focus 
 Changes - Previously, CPRS providers who used adaptive technologies, such 
 as screen readers had trouble navigating some areas of CPRS. On the 
 Encounter form, for example, the focus would be "lost" when tabbing 
 through the controls-meaning that the focus was on items, but the screen 
 reader did not speak anything. This "lost" focus made the controls almost 
 impossible to use effectively.
  
 Resolution: The focus will no longer be "lost" to adaptive technologies 
 on the encounter form-specifically on the Visit Type tab on the Encounter 
 form.
  
 --508: Header Bar - Screen Reader Not Reading RDV Listbox Checkbox State
  
 Resolution:     JAWS will now read the RDV listbox checkbox state. If the 
 checkbox is checked JAWS will tell the user it is a check box and then 
 announce that it is checked.
  
 --508:  Screen Reader Should State whether Checkboxes Are 
 Checked/Unchecked under Historical Visit (Current Activities)
  
 Resolution: The Historical Visit check box on the New Visit Tab in the 
 Provider and Location for Current Activities dialog will now read the 
 state of the check box.
  
 --508: Available Reminders Dialog - Treeview/listbox Combo Data Not 
 Accessible with a Screen Reader
  
 Resolution:     The data in the list to the right of the treeview will 
 now be read with each treeview item.
  
 --508: JAWS Did Not Read the Day-of-Week (DOW) Schedule at the end of the 
 DOW Schedule Form
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.
  
 --508: JAWS Not Reading Items on the Infusion Order Dialog Correctly
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem. JAWS now reads the 
 Administration Times and the Expected First Dose time on the Unit Dose 
 Order dialog and the IV Order Dialog.
  
 --Template Preview Buttons Disappear with Large Fonts (Remedy #110715)
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected the font problem, and the Template 
 Preview and Consult Order Pre-Requisites forms display their buttons 
 appropriately regardless of the font size the user has selected.
  
 --Font Size and Upper Case and Lower Case Affecting Printing (Remedy 
 #70295) 
  
 Resolution: Developers fixed the problems affecting printed items. They 
 should print correctly regardless of font size and/or use of upper/lower 
 case characters.  Printouts with changes:
  
   --Reports from Reports tab
   --Progress Note Print
   --Consult Pre-Requisite Print
   --Consult SF513 Print
   --Lab Results Print
   --Patient Inquiry (Demographics) Print (Changed to maintain consistency)
   --Template Preview Print (Changed to maintain consistency)
  
 --508: Read Only Edit Fields - Previously, when a screen reader got to 
 certain fields, it would read each line by starting with "Read Only Edit" 
 then the text with each arrow down.
  
 Resolution: Developers change CPRS and replaced the read only edits with 
 a label component. When a screen reader is running, the label caption 
 changes to match the text in the hint
  
 --508: CPRS Does Not Enable Screen Readers to Differentiate between 
 Auto-Accept Quick Orders and Non-Auto-Accept Quick Orders
  
 Resolution: Auto-accept quick orders will now speak "Auto Accept" before 
 the order menu text is spoken.
  
 --508: Progress Notes: Screen Reader says "Procedure date/time" instead 
 of "Date/Time of Note"
  
 Resolution: Developers changed CPRS, and the note field date/time should 
 read "Date/Time of Note:".
  
 --508: Medication Order Dialog-Medication Field and Quick Order Field 
 Need Labels
  
 Resolution: Developers placed JAWS labels on the Medication field 
 ("Medication") and the Quick order field ("Quick Orders").
  
 --508: Notifications-Forward a Notification-New Buttons Are Not in the 
 Correct Tab Order
  
 Resolution: Developers improved the tab order of the buttons-placing the 
 Add button after the source list, the Remove and Remove all....
  
 --508: Clinical Reminders-Edit Reminders on Coversheet-Extra Tabs in the 
 Tab Order
  
 Resolution: Developers removed the extra tabs for the images and hidden 
 drop down list.
  
 --508: Print Dialog on Reports Tab, with Larger Font Sizes, Loses Buttons 
 and Is Unusable - The select device print dialog that appears when you 
 print a report from the reports tab is not resizing properly for font 
 changes.  
  
 Developers corrected this problem. .
  
 --508 Splitter Bar Can Be Lost with Resizing and Font Size Change - 508 
 testers reported a problem on the Reports tab. If a user selected a 
 report that caused the right side of the screen to display two screens 
 (Top/bottom), such as the Clinical Reports/Patient 
 Information/Demographics report, and the user moved the splitter bar to 
 the bottom of the screen, and then changed to a larger font (8 to 18), 
 then the bottom data screen could be moved off the bottom of the 
 screen-and in some cases cannot be retrieved.  
  
 Resolution: Developers corrected this problem.

     - Vcredist_x86.exe (V2.0.50727.42)  Microsoft Visual C++  
                               2005 Redistributable.
                               It is called by JAWSUpdate.exe
  *OR_30_243_SRC.ZIP           CPRSChart Source             BINARY
  
 *(This file contains, in the CPRS-Chart folder, a "README.TXT" file 
   of major importance to sites utilizing the Delphi source code.)
  
 BORLNDMM.DLL has now been included in that application.  This should
 prevent any problems with the subsequent auto-update to CPRS v27.
  
 The BORLNDMM.DLL must be installed in either the current CPRSChart.EXE 
 directory or reachable via the system PATH. This DLL has been required
 by CPRS since v26, but because CPRS v27 is compiled with a new
 version of Delphi, this DLL must be replaced with the current version
 included here. Failure to update this DLL will prevent CPRS v27 from 
 running.
  
  
 All the files in the JAWS Support Files zip file 
 (CPRS27_JAWS_SUPPORT_FILES.ZIP) should be copied into the Program 
 Files\Vista\Common Files directory. One of these files, JAWSUPDATE.exe, 
 must be run in order to enable the JAWS code.  This will install a 
 Freedom Scientific COM object that is compatible with JAWS 7.1 or 
 greater.  You must have administrator rights on your machine when you run 
 JAWSUPDATE.  After running JAWSUPDATE, the user will no longer require 
 administrator rights.
