  Overview:
  =========
   
     Problem:
     --------
     
     An unexpected narcotic order was found in Order Entry/Results 
     Reporting (OERR) for a patient. Upon examination of the affected 
     order in file #100 (ORDERS) it was discovered that one patient's
     Audiology consult order had been overwritten by a different patient's
     Outpatient controlled drug order. The Outpatient order was a
     prescription renewal order generated by the AudioCARE AudioRENEWAL
     function. The class III code which performs the renewal process was
     not getting the assigned order number for the renewal the same way
     that Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS) does, causing the
     overwrite. 
  
     The AudioCARE AudioRENEWAL Module was de-activated by all 43 locations
     on Jan.16, 2009 to prevent the problem from occurring.
  
   
     Resolution:
     -----------     
     A new Class I interface has been written so the AudioCARE 
     AudioRENEWAL process can obtain the assigned order number the same way
     that Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS) does. Patch OR*3*290
     installs the new interface. In order to implement the new interface,
     modifications to the renewal code in the Class III routine VEXRX were
     necessary. The refill code of the VEXRX routine was not affected. The
     AudioRENEWAL process will now use a standard CPRS Application
     Programming Interface (API) to perform the renewal.
    
     This new Class I interface has been written in such a way that other
     renewal systems will be able to utilize the same API to renew
     Outpatient prescriptions. However, other renewal systems have not
     been tested using this software.
   
     OR*3*290 introduces the new mail group, AUTORENEWAL. Messages to
     this group will contain information about prescription renewals that
     could not be automatically processed. For example: a lock on the order
     failed, or the CPRS order number is missing from the PRESCRIPTION file
     (#52).
    
     A new parameter has been added: OR AUTORENEWAL USER. The auto renewal 
     process uses a proxy user to be the 'entered by' person in the ORDERS
     (#100) file. This parameter defines that user. Sites previously 
     using the renewal function may already have USER,AUDIOCARE PHONE 
     set up for renewals. If not, set up a proxy user such as 
     "RENEWAL,AUTO" in the NEW PERSON (#200) file to place in the new
     parameter.
    
     A new notification is being released with this patch: OP RX RENEWAL  
     REQUEST. This notification is exported with package parameter
     values set as follows: 
      
       . ORB ARCHIVE PERIOD - 30
       . ORB DELETE MECHANISM - All Recipients
       . ORB FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER - No
       . ORB FORWARD SUPERVISOR - No
       . ORB FORWARD SURROGATES - No
       . ORB PROCESSING FLAG - Disabled
       . ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS - Ordering Provider, Attending, Primary 
                                   and Teams (OAPT)
       . ORB URGENCY - High
   
     ***Important Note***
     Notifications are processed by IEN (internal entry number) from the 
     OE/RR NOTIFICATIONS file (100.9). Any site-defined notifications run
     the risk of being over-written by new notifications that are 
     nationally released. If you have locally defined notifications, you
     may need to renumber them before this patch will install.
     Specifically, IEN #73 is being added.
   
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  An updated CPRS Technical Manual, CPRS GUI Technical Manual, and a 
  combined Release Notes/Installation Guide will be distributed with
  OR*3*290. The documents are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
  at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
   
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  All sites are expected to install OR*3*290 to their production Vista 
  system, even if they are not currently using AudioCARE applications. 
  This installation does not change the functionality of CPRS or Outpatient
  Pharmacy applications.
   
  For the renewal process to be fully functional using the new Class I 
  interface sites licensed to run the AudioRENEWAL Module must install
  the following patches:
   
   PSO*7*328      OUTPATIENT PHARMACY
   OR*3*290       ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
   
  PSO*7*328 is an information only patch that explains how to download
  the updated routine VEXRX (Class III refill). The updated VEXRX should be
  installed prior to installing OR*3*290 at all sites using AudioCARE 
  applications, even if they are not using the AUDIORENEWAL module. 
  
  ENVIRONMENT CHECK: OR*3*290 contains an environment check that looks 
  for the previous renewal version of VEXRX that processed renewals. If
  the previous renewal version of VEXRX is found, the installation of
  OR*3*290 aborts. If this occurs retrieve and install the correct VEXRX
  routine, then use the 'Restart Install of Package(s)' option to complete
  the OR*3*290 patch installation.
  
  ***Before installing patch OR*3*290, consult with the Pharmacy staff to 
  determine the appropriate person to coordinate the membership for the 
  AUTORENEWAL mail group used in the renewal process. Messages to 
  this group will contain information on renewals not sent to providers 
  and processed record count totals.*** 
  
  Below is a step-by-step procedure for installing OR*3*290.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
 This section is only for sites licensed to use the AudioRENEWAL Module. 
 The purpose of this section is to provide information for consideration 
 after routine VEXRX and patch OR*3*290 are installed. IRM, Pharmacy, and 
 Providers should work together to completed this section and monitor
 renewal activity.
  
 Refer to the Release Notes/Installation Guide for additional information 
 about the steps below. 
  
   1. Assign members to the AUTORENEWAL mail group using the option Mail
      Group Edit [XMEDITMG].
  
   2. If necessary, set up the proxy user in the NEW PERSON (#200) file for
      filing renewal requests. Sites may already have USER,AUDIOCARE PHONE
      set up for renewals. This is the user that will be the 'entered by'
      person in CPRS for the automatic renewal orders. No menu options, 
      person classes, or keys need to be added to this user.
  
   3. Edit the parameter OR AUTORENEWAL USER and enter the proxy user
      defined in step 2.
  
   4. Review the settings for the notification OP RX RENEWAL REQUEST very
      closely and determine the settings which are most appropriate for
      your usage of AudioRENEWAL. If your site elects to use this
      new notification, level changes can be made for system, division,
      location, service, team(OE/RR), or user entities. Do not edit the
      exported package level parameter settings.
  
   5. If using the new notification OP RX RENEWAL REQUEST, enable the
      notification using the option Enable/Disable Notifications [ORB3
      PROCESSING FLAG] at the appropriate hierarchy level for your 
      usage.
  
   6. Update AudioRENEWAL Clinic List on the AudioCARE server.
