Subject: CORRECT TRANSFER MEDICATION ORDER MOCHA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the same issue corrected in patch OR*3*380 except 
 that it incorporates the modifications made in patch OR*3*311 (part of 
 the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application, MOCHA, 2.0 release).
  
 This patch corrects an issue related to transferring a medication from 
 either Inpatient to Outpatient or vice-versa.  In specific scenarios, a 
 wrong dosage is automatically placed in the order dialog upon 
 transferring the medication resulting in a possible overdose.  
  
 For example: Suppose there is an orderable item configured with a 20 MG 
 Outpatient dosage and a 120 MG Inpatient dosage (note that there is no 20 
 MG Inpatient dosage).  If the provider attempts to transfer an Outpatient 
 medication order with the 20 MG dosage to an Inpatient medication order, 
 the 120 MG dosage is automatically selected because it contains the 
 characters "20 MG".  In this scenario, the automatic dosage selection 
 creates a 6-fold increase over the intended dosage.

 PSPO 2472 
 When transferring a medication order from either inpatient to outpatient 
 or outpatient to inpatient, CPRS may inadvertently select the incorrect 
 dosage for the transferred order.  Refer to Remedy ticket INC000000906468 
 for resolution.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 1. INC000000906468 - OERR - Orders Tab: Dosage being changed transferring
                      med orders from outpatient to inpatient
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The dosage of a med order was being changed to a higher dosage when 
 transferring it from outpatient to inpatient or from inpatient to 
 outpatient.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 CPRS developers have corrected this problem such that in this case the 
 dosage will be blanked out and the provider will have to enter or select 
 a dosage manually.
  
 2. INC000000910347 - OERR - Meds Tab: Transfer to Outpatient - Error 
 Message
  
 Problem:
 -------
 While testing patient safety advisory AL13-10, a MOCHA 2 test site 
 identified an error message that is generated during the transfer of a 
 medication order from inpatient to outpatient.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The code did not properly initialize a variable. The software is modified 
 to properly initialize that variable.
