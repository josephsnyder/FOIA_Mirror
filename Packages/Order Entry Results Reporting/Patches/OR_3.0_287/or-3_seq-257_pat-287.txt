Subject: FIX FILE 101.24 ENTRIES EXPORTED IN PATCH 256

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch addresses PSI-08-005.
  It is a 'Patch to a Patch' to fix a problem found in patch
  OR*3.0*256 where some data was exported in the OE/RR Reports file
  (#101.24) that was not intended to be released until CPRS GUI v27 
 (Patch OR*3.0*243).  See Remedy # HD0000000227213.
  
  A number of differences in file 101.24 were found, but it appears 
  that there are 6 reports that have been identified that don't show
  data when selected.  The report entries in the  OE/RR Reports file
  ORRPL LAB CY, ORRPL LAB EM, ORRPL LAB  SP, ORRPW LAB CY,  ORRPW
  LAB EM and ORRPW LAB SP are pointing to a routine that will not 
  be released until OR*3*243.  
  
  Example of the problem:  If a user selects the Reports Tab/Clinical 
  Reports/Laboratory/Surgical Pathology, EM or CY, the user will be 
  presented with a Header that presents on the top display box. 
  
  Collection Date  |  Specimen  |  Accession #  |  + 
  
  But no results are displayed .
  
  The complete OE/RR Reports file (#101.24) is being re-exported with
  this patch with the correct data to resolve this problem and other 
  inconsistencies that have been found in the file.  Entries with
  internal file numbers >999 will be replaced when this
  patch is installed into your account.
  
  If you have not installed patch OR*3.0*256, please do so just prior
  to installing this patch, since it will be a required install.
  
  PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES ADDRESSED

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
  to users.  Installation will take less than 1 minute.  Users may remain
  on the system.
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*287):
          a.  Backup a Transport Global
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package OR*3.0*287.
      If the account you are installing into has already had patch
      OR*3.0*243 (CPRS GUI v27) installed, you will get the following
      message when installing patch 287:

 Data Dictionary FAILED the screening logic, file will NOT be installed!
