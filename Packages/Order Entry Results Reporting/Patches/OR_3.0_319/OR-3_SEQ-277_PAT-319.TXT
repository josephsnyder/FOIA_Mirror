Subject: VISTAWEB RPC ADDITION FOR NHIN

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch adds a new remote procedure call "ORVW FACLIST" and its associated
 routine to the OR CPRS GUI CHART menu option.
  
 This new routine will be used by VistAWeb to get the entire treating facility
 list for a given patient.  This is needed to access all treating facilities
 for patients in order for VistAWeb to recognize the facilities in the OTHER
 category, particularly for the new National Health Information Network 
 (NHIN) data providers.
  
 For more information regarding NHIN, see 
 http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&mode=2&cached=true&objID=1142
 
 This patch contains a single post-install routine that adds RPC "ORVW FACLIST"
 to the OR CPRS GUI CHART menu option.
