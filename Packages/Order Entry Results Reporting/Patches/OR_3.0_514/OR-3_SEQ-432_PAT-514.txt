Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to add new items to the Computerized Patient

 of Mission Act - Urgent Care.
  
 The new items are the ENROLLMENT PRORITY (#.07) field, ENROLLMENT 
 SUBGROUP (.12) field, and the ENROLLMENT STATUS (#.04) field from the 
 PATIENT ENROLLMENT (#27.11) file. The status field will be shown as 
 'Category' in order to be consistent with how the information is 
 displayed today in VistA.

 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Area Manager may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 Since this patch contains only a single routine modification and no data 
 was modified, the only necessary step for back-out and roll back is
 restoring the backup created prior to installing.
