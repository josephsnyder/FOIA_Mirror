Subject: LOCKING AND PARAMETER HELP TEXT PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 1. A site reported a problem with accessing a patient's records after
 their system was co-located. A problem was discovered with the length of
 the lock timeouts. This patch corrects this problem by modifying the locks
 to use the system parameter for timeouts, if available. 
  
 2. A site reported an issue with the help text/description associated with
 the parameter OR OREMAS MED ORDERS. The description for this parameter
 does not make it clear that it only affects Inpatient Medications orders. 
  
  
 Associated Remedy:
 ==================
 1. HD0000000223856 Intermittent Error message when signing lab orders.
 2. HD0000000069676  help description no longer true

 Overview:
 =========
 1. HD0000000223856 Intermittent Error message when signing lab orders.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem has to do with errors occasionally showing up when
    attempting to sign orders. However, the message detail shows no name
    for the person who is working on the order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The lock timeouts in routine ORX2 have been updated to use the new
    system parameter.
  
    **** Important Note ****
    The change to use the DILOCKTM parameter does not completely eliminate
    these intermittent messages. It does allow a site to adjust the
    DILOCKTM parameter to alleviate the problem. However, if you are having
    a problem with these lock messages and you choose to increase the value
    of DILOCKTM, be sure to consider that real lock-out situations will now
    have to wait this amount of time before reporting back to the user. In 
    addition, remember that DILOCKTM affects ALL applications that use this
    parameter. Increasing this value could cause delays in processing. You
    must balance how many inappropriate messages you get against how many
    real lock messages are received to determine the appropriate value.
  
    Patch DI*22*147 stresses that Cache sites should NEVER set DILOCKTM
    value to less than 3. For more information on DILOCKTM, please see
    DI*22*147. Since the setting of this parameter affects ALL
    applications, please consult your technical support and/or national
    support - Health Systems Technical Support Team before adjusting the
    value of DILOCKTM.
  
    In addition, there have been reports of locks that are left 
    outstanding even though the user has exited the option. Those problems 
    are still being investigated. This change does not affect those 
    situations. 
  
    The difference in the two cases is that the one this patch addresses 
    is most often seen as 'Another person' is working on this order. The 
    other issues should show the name of the person working on the order.
  
 2. HD0000000069676 help description no longer true
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem has to do with the description associated with the OR
    OREMAS MED ORDERS parameter. The description does not indicate that
    this parameters only affects Inpatient Medications orders.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The DESCRIPTION field (#8989.512) of the PARAMETER DEFINITION file
    (#8989.51) was updated to accurately reflect what orders are covered by
    this parameter.
