 Problem: 
 --------
 When a note exists without text it can be signed in VistA roll/scroll 
 CPRS Menu [ORDERS MENU] sign option. An empty note cannot be signed with 
 CPRS and some users were using VistA options to sign these notes.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If a note has no text and is attempted to be signed, signing is not allowed and
 the message 'This note contains no text and cannot be signed.' is displayed to
 the user's screen.  This is the same message displayed in CPRS GUI when a note
 without text is attempted to be signed. Patch TIU*1.0*274 was also created to
 address this issue when signing notes using TIU options.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine ORCNOTE to display the message 'This note contains no
 text and cannot be signed.' preventing a note without text from being
 signed.  The entry points into the procedure is ELSIG^ORCNOTE.
  
 ELSIG^ORCNOTE is the code executed by ORC TIU SIGN DOCUMENTS which is the
 protocol for Sign under the CPRS Notes menu (ORC TIU ACTIONS) [CPRS Menu - 
 ORDERS MENU]
