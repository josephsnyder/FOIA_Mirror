Subject: DRUG NAME MISSING FROM PENDING ORDERS

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 The option [ORCM CONVERT MENUS] was distributed in patch OR*2.5*49 which 
 was released on March 16, 1999 as a pre-install to prepare for the 
 implementation of the Computerized Patient Record system (CPRS). Option
 [ORCM CONVERT MENUS] was used to convert the "add order" protocol menus
 that were in use PRIOR to the installation of CPRS to the new files that
 would be used with CPRS. 
  
 If the [ORCM CONVERT MENUS] option is executed in a current system, new
 Outpatient Medication orders entered into CPRS have a problem with 
 the display. The problem is that the medication name is missing from 
 the display on the Orders Tab.
  
 This patch removes the obsolete menu. All sites that inadvertently
 executed this option in the past have been repaired individually by 
 Enterprise Product Support personnel. The need for repair is immediate
 and has no dependency on this patch. Removal of the option prevents future
 occurrences. This was reported as PSI-07-139.

    the ORDER DIALOG (#101.41) file. The [ORCM CONVERT MENUS] option is
