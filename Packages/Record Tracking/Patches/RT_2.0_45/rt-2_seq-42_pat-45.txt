Subject: MISC RECORD TRACKING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  
 This patch addresses two issues reported in the Record Tracking
 package. One is an error that occurs occasionally while using the 
 Automatic Clinic Request Initialization [RT SM-CLINIC REQUESTS] option.  
 The other issue involves deleting a menu option from the Record Tracking
 Package.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY
 =================
 Issue 1: HD191914 - Retire RT option
 Issue 2: HD169107 - <UNDEFINED>BLD^RTQ2

 N/A
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Fayetteville, AR
 S. Texas HCS
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 ISSUE 1: Retire RT option
 -------------------------
 The sites have requested to have the Record Tracking Patient Charge-Out
 [RT TRANS-PATIENT] option disabled and then deleted since patients can no
 longer carry their records in locked bags.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Kids build will automatically delete the Patient Charge-Out [RT
 TRANS-PATIENT] option from the menu.
  
  
 ISSUE 2: <UNDEFINED>BLD^RTQ2
 ----------------------------
 When the menu option [RT SM-CLINIC REQUESTS] is selected, the process 
 looks at the "C" cross-reference of the SCHEDULED ADMISSIONS (#41.1) 
 file.  When the process gets to the end of the "C" cross reference,
 instead of quitting, it continues even though the variable SDPL is not 
 defined and the process crashes.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A data check will be added to the undefined variable so if SDPL is not 
 defined the process will terminate correctly.
