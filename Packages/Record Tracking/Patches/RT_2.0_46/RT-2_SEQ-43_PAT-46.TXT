Subject: FIX INSTITUTION PARAMETER ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch addresses an issue reported in the Record Tracking (RT)
  package.  This issue is that the software allows the user to enter
  the Record Tracking Total System Menu [RT OVERALL] menu option 
  without setting the INSTITUTION parameters.  When users try to use 
  the Charge Out Pull List Records [RT PULL-CHARGE-OUT] menu option 
  they receive the following message: "This function requires the 
  user to be signed onto the system with INSTITUTION parameters defined."
  They are then bumped out and are returned to the original menu.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  
  ISSUE: Unable to use an option
  ----------------------------
  When users try to use the Charge Out Pull List Record [RT PULL-CHARGE-OUT]
  menu option, they receive the following message: "This function requires
  the user to be signed onto the system with INSTITUTION parameters defined."
  They are then bumped out and are returned to the original menu.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The process is allowing the users to enter NULL at the "Select Record 
  Tracking File Room:" prompt but it is the answer to this prompt that
  sets the INSTITUTION parameters.  The code will be modified to force the 
  users to answer the prompt whether it be an answer or an "^" to exit.  
  
  The error message will also be modified for users attempting to access
  the Charge Out Pull List Record option without going through the menu
  tree. The wording "Please use the Record Tracking Total System Menu to
  access this option" has been added to the message.
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===========================
  **********************************************************************
  * PLEASE NOTE BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH INSTALLATION:                   *
  * Because the two required builds/patches were not tracked by the    *
  * National Patch Module at the time they were distributed there is no*
  * way to add them to the build in the patch module.  They are listed *
  * at the top of the patch description as required patches but there  *
  * is no way to force the installation to abort if they are have not  *
  * been installed already.                                            *
  * Both required patches are quite old.  Patch RT*2.0*3 was released  *
  * on MAR 12,1992 and RT*2.0*16 was released on MAY 17,1994.  It is   *
  * unlikely that any site that has the Record Tracking package at     *
  * their site will not have these two patches installed; however, the *
  * possibility exists.                                                *
