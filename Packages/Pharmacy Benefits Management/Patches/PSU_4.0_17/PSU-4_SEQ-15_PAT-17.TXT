 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD000000278294 - 6 PBM Extract Lab HL7 Messages dropping SSN
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The CMOP-NAT routine which handles the parsing of the data contained in 
 the HL7 message is storing a null ("") value in the SSN field (# .05) of 
 ZZPBM3 HL7 file (#99999) when no Alias SSN is found.
  
 The Patient Identification (PID) segment of the HL7 message contains both 
 a Patient SSN and an Alias SSN.  As the routine processes this segment, it
 stores the Patient SSN in the SSN field of the database and then it
 overwrites that SSN with the Alias SSN.  In the cases where a patient
 doesn't have an Alias SSN, the system overwrites the SSN (Patient SSN)
 with a null ("").
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 The CMOP-NAT routine PSULRHL2 has been modified to store the Patient SSN
 only and will not store the Alias SSN unless no Patient SSN exists.
