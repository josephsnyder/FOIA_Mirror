Subject: PBM EXTRACT ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Currently, the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) extract blocks the 
 transmission of chemistry lab results for "Employee Veteran" and
 "Employee Non-Veteran." This patch addresses the New Service Request (NSR)
 #20080810 to transmit the chemistry lab results for "Employee Veteran"
 via Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging to the PBM extract database while
 continuing to block the chemistry lab results for "Employee Non-Veteran."
  
 This patch also addresses the following.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Several facilities were reporting that selected laboratory tests were not 
 present in the Structured Query Language (SQL) database used by PBM to
 perform medication use safety surveillance, while the source data was
 clearly available in local VistA and Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS). Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the
 laboratory results did transmit as expected, but the lab test name did 
 not, resulting in database search failures.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The source of the error was traced to laboratory tests with a National 
 Lab Test (NLT) Name containing a tilde (~) character. This character 
 is also used as the delimiter in HL7 message processing, and the extra 
 tilde caused the routines that parse the transmitted data to be offset by 
 one data element. The correction is to translate any tilde characters in 
 the NLT name into an underscore (_) character, so that any remaining 
 tilde characters are solely present as the expected HL7 delimiters.
