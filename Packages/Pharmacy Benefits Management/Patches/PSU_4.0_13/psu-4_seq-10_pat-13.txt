Subject: DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY PHARMACY LOCATIONS SHOWING AS UNMAPPED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct 2 problems with the Pharmacy Statistics reports 
 [PSU PBM AUTO] & [PSU PBM MANUAL].
  
 The first problem is with Drug Accountability Pharmacy locations showing
 up in the PBM Unmapped Locations report as unmapped when actually they are
 mapped.  The second is the problem of the Copay status showing as N
 regardless of whether or not this field is Y or N.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
 ==================
 1. HD198412  -  PBM UNmapped locations showing again
 2. HD227109  -  PBM EXTRACT COPAY FIELD NOT FUNCTIONING
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 ========================

 Hines VAMC
 Puget Sound HCS
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD198412
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running Pharmacy Statistics using either Automatic Pharmacy 
    Statistics [PSU PBM AUTO] or Manual Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM
    MANUAL], a Mailman message titled PBM Unmapped Locations is included
    with the statistics that shows pharmacy locations are unmapped when
    they really are mapped.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the report to display the correct locations as unmapped (if 
    any) in the "PBM Unmapped Locations" Mailman message included with the
    Pharmacy Statistics report.
  
    Routine:  PSUPR2 
  
  
 2. HD227109
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In the prescription extract from Pharmacy Statistics, the Copay status
    field is erroneously always set to "N".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the logic in the report to correctly evaluate the Copay status.
