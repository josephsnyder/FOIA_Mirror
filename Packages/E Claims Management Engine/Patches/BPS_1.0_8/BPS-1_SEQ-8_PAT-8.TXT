Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*290
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*411
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*8
  
 The three patches (PSO*7*290, IB*2*411 and BPS*1*8) are being released in 
 a Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution bundle BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 4.0. For more specific instructions
 please refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 The main purpose of this patch is to implement functionality that 
 supports e-billing of the patients secondary insurance plans. These 
 modifications allow the VA to send additional claims electronically to the
 patient's secondary insurances in order to reimburse money from those
 payers that are responsible for the payments but were not billed
 previously. Thus this enhancement will help VA sites to increase their
 revenue. 
  
 While claims to the Primary insurance companies are sent automatically,
 the claims to the Secondary insurance companies can now be sent manually
 by using the new menu option Process Secondary/TRICARE Rx to ECME [BPS COB
 PROCESS SECOND TRICARE. The same menu option can also be used to manually
 generate primary claims if the patient has a dual eligibility (for
 example, a TRICARE patient has both reimbursable insurance and TRICARE
 plans with Pharmacy coverage), these cases were not previously handled by
 the software. With this enhancement patch, duel eligible patients can now
 be manually billed using the ePharmacy software.
  
 Two new reports are introduced with this patch to support both secondary 
 billing and primary billing for TRICARE patients. The first report, 
 Potential Secondary Rx Claims Report [BPS COB RPT SECONDARY CLAIMS], will
 identify prescriptions/refills that potentially can be billed to the
 secondary insurance plans. The second report, Potential TRICARE Claims
 Report [BPS COB RPT TRICARE CLAIMS], will identify prescriptions/refills
 for TRICARE patients that potentially can be billed to the TRICARE
 insurance plans.
  
 All three new menu options are combined together under the new ECME 
 Pharmacy COB [BPS COB MENU] menu:
  
     COB    ECME Pharmacy COB ...
         SEC    Potential Secondary Rx Claims Report
         TRI    Potential TRICARE Claims Report
         PRO    Process Secondary/TRICARE Rx to ECME
  
 This patch modifies the Electronic Claims Management Engine v1.0 
 application as described below:
  
  
 1. ECME engine:
 The modifications made in this patch allow: 
 - the engine to recognize secondary claims and process additional COB 
 (Coordination Of Benefits) fields specific for secondary claims
  
 - the engine to use specific plans and rate types selected by the user
  
 - specific data collected for secondary claims to be stored in the BPS 
 TRANSACTION, BPS LOG OF TRANSACTIONS, BPS CLAIMS and BPS REQUESTS files
  
 - specific data collected for secondary claims to be processed, formatted 
 and included in HL7 messages sent to the payer
  
 - specific entries in the BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS file (#9002313.91) to be 
 updated in order to process the additional COB fields and transmit them 
 to the secondary payer in the correct format
  
 - COB Indicator information to be returned in the EN^BPSNCPDP API 
  
 - the ECME to send reject codes to Outpatient Pharmacy along with the COB 
 indicator so the Pharmacy software can distinguish reject codes returned 
 by secondary and primary payers
  
 The new routine BPSFLD01 was created to store GET, SET and FORMAT code to 
 support processing of the COB fields transmitted to the secondary payers.
  
 The claim status code was adjusted to provide correct status information 
 for secondary and primary claims.
  
 The API DUR1^BPSNCPD3 (ICR #4560) was modified to allow the calling 
 application to specify the COB (payer sequence) indicator of the claim 
 for which it is called and to implement a new format of the array for  
 returned values.
  
 The testing tool was modified to process secondary claims.
  
  
  
 2. ECME User Screen modifications to display COB (payer sequence) 
 indicators:
  
 2.1. Main Display Screen and Further Research Screen modifications. 
 To distinguish primary and secondary claims displayed on the screen, each 
 status line is supplied with COB indicators: "p" for primary and "s" for 
 secondary claims. Status of another claim associated with the same
 prescription/refill (if any) is displayed in parenthesis. 
   9.1 ACETAMINOPHEN 650 12345-4321-22 03/02 102287 1/0113558 W RT DIS/NR
       p-Reversal accepted
   9.2 MEDROXYPROGESTRON 00009-0050-02 02/11 102289 0/0113560 W RT ACT/RL
       s-Payable (p-Payable)
  
  
 2.2. The Print Claim Log screen displays a new label to indicate the COB 
 insurance level:
     Rx Coordination of Benefits: PRIMARY
  
 2.3. The initial page of the developer log was updated to display the 
 information for the specific claim line selected. 
     Insurance: COB INSURANCE
     RX Coord of Benefits: Secondary
  
 The subsequent pages are based upon the prescription and fill and are not 
 able to differentiate between insurances.  However, a log entry 
 indicating the COB level will be added each time the prescription and fill
 is processed. 
     BPSOSRB-Secondary Insurance
     BPSOSQA-Secondary Insurance
  
  
 3. Reversing claims:
 The primary claim cannot be reversed if there is a payable secondary 
 claim. In such a case the user will be advised to reverse the secondary 
 claim first. 
  
   1.12 FLURAZEPAM 15MG C 00140-0065-14 03/04 102322$ 2/0113596 W RT ACT/RL
 cannot be Reversed if the secondary claim is payable.
 Please reverse the secondary claim first.
  
  
 4. Resubmit Claims and Resubmit claims w/EDITS (RED) functionality:
 The primary claim cannot be resubmitted if there is a payable secondary 
 claim. In such a case the user shall be advised to reverse the secondary 
 claim first. 
  
  1.12  FLURAZEPAM 15MG C 00140-0065-14 03/04 102322$ 2/0113596 W RT ACT/RL
 Are you sure?(Y/N)? y  YES
 The claim: 
  1.12  FLURAZEPAM 15MG C 00140-0065-14 03/04 102322$ 2/0113596 W RT ACT/RL
 cannot be Resubmitted if the secondary claim is payable.
 Please reverse the secondary claim first.
  
  
 5. Send to Worklist functionality:
 The ECME software was modified to 
 - allow secondary claims to be sent to the Pharmacy Worklist manually 
 from the User Screen,
 - send Refill Too Soon and DUR rejects for secondary claims to the 
 Pharmacy Worklist automatically. 
  
  
 6. ECME Claim Results and Status reports:
 The ECME Claim Results and Status reports (Payable Claims Report [BPS RPT
 PAYABLE], Rejected Claims Report [BPS RPT REJECTION], Reversal Claims
 Report [BPS RPT REVERSAL], Claims Submitted, Not Yet Released [BPS RPT NOT
 RELEASED], Recent Transactions [BPS RPT RECENT TRANSACTIONS], and Closed
 Claims Report [BPS RPT CLOSED CLAIMS]) were modified to display the COB
 indicators. The Excel format of the reports include the COB indicator of
 the submitted claim as a new piece of data in the data string.
  
  
 7. ECME Claims-Response Inquiry [BPS RPT CLAIMS RESPONSE] report:
 The report reflects new COB data sent in secondary claims.
  
  
 8. ECME Potential Secondary Rx Claims Report [BPS COB RPT SECONDARY 
 CLAIMS]:
 This new report returns all primary prescription claims, whether 
 processed electronically or paper, that has possible secondary insurance 
 identified in the patient insurance file.
  
  
 9. Potential TRICARE Claims Report [BPS COB RPT TRICARE CLAIMS]:
 This new report returns prescriptions that have not yet been billed for 
 any patient who has an active insurance plan with a type of plan = TRICARE
 and who has a dual eligibility (veteran and TRICARE) and whose
 prescription Rx Patient Status is not exempt for TRICARE Billing. This
 report also includes prescriptions for patients who have TRICARE only in
 case of the system not being available and the prescription not being
 processed automatically by ECME.
  
  
 10. Process Secondary/TRICARE Rx to ECME [BPS COB PROCESS SECOND TRICARE]:
 The new option was introduced to process the claims identified on the new 
 reports.  This option will submit the claim to ECME and also can be 
 used to resubmit the claim when the user needs to change data specific 
 for secondary claims. Any other processing on this claim can be done
 through the existing actions available on the ECME User Screen.
  
 When processing a claim using a specific prescription number, the users
 will need to select the fill number from the list provided by the software
 to generate a claim. The user will be required to enter the billing rate
 type since there are 2 types of claims that will primarily be using this
 option. Reimbursable Insurance and TRICARE (including TRICARE Reimbursable
 Insurance) are the only types of Billing Rates that will be allowed to be 
 used for ECME billing at this time.
  
 When processing the secondary claim, the users will be presented with the 
 secondary claim data and will be prompted to edit this data if 
 necessary.  Secondary claim data elements include:
  
 Other Coverage Code
 Other Payer Coverage Type
 Other Payer ID Qualifier
 Other Payer ID
 Other Payer Date
  
 If the primary payer paid the primary claim:
 Other Payer Amount Paid Qualifier (mult)
 Other Payer Amount Paid (mult)
  
 If the primary payer rejected the primary claim:
 Other Payer Reject Codes (mult)
  
 This option can also be used to resubmit secondary claims when the user
 needs to edit the specific secondary claims information submitted 
 previously. The user will be prompted for the same information and this 
 time the default values for the prompts will be set to data submitted in 
 the latest transaction. In addition during resubmission the user can 
 change the secondary payer and the rate type if needed. The resubmission 
 is allowed only for rejected or reversed secondary claims. The payable 
 claims need to be reversed in the User Screen before they can be 
 resubmitted through this menu option.
  
 This option also allows the user to submit and resubmit primary claims 
 for prescriptions/refills for TRICARE patients and patients with dual 
 eligibility. When processing primary claims the users will be prompted to 
 select a primary payer for the e-claim and the rate type. The software 
 allows the user to resubmit the existing primary claims and change the 
 payer and/or the rate type if needed. The resubmission is allowed only 
 for rejected or reversed claims. The payable claims need to be reversed 
 in the User Screen before they can be resubmitted through this menu 
 option.
  
 11. COB indicators for Pharmacy Activity log entries:
 ECME code was modified to add COB indicators to Pharmacy Activity log 
 when the claim is resubmitted via User Screen actions "Resubmit Claim" 
 and "Resubmit Claim w/EDITS" and also when it is reversed manually via
 "Reverse Payable Claim" action or automatically by ECME nightly processing
 job (auto reversals).
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Tickets:
 --------------------------------------------------
 1. HD374000  Inability to reverse TRICARE claims
 2. HD374001  Incorrect Rx cost calculation for TRICARE claims
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ---------------------------
 1. HD374000  Inability to reverse TRICARE claims
  
 Problem:
 --------
 VA Eastern Kansas HCS reported they are unable to reverse electronic 
 TRICARE claims through the ECME user screen.  They are getting a message 
 stating:  "The claim: ... is Tricare claim and cannot be Reversed."
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Remove the lines of code in routine BPSSCRRV that prevented this 
 functionality.
  
  
 2. HD374001  Incorrect Rx cost calculation for TRICARE claims
  
 Problem:
 --------
 VA Eastern Kansas HCS reported that the billing software is incorrectly 
 calculating the prescription cost for ECME claims in cases where the drug 
 is using the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER field. The billing software is 
 calculating the cost based on the NCPDP quantity rather than the 
 dispensed quantity.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correct the ECME utilities STARRAY^BPSNCPD1 and EN^BPSNCPD2 to NOT send 
 the NCPDP quantity to billing, but instead send the dispensed quantity to 
 billing as found in the prescription fill and refill data.  Continue to 
 send the NCPDP quantity in the ECME ePharmacy transaction. Also, correct 
 the ECME utility IBSEND^BPSECMP2 to send the dispensed quantity to 
 billing as found in the prescription fill and refill data.
