    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*358
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*434
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*9
  
 The three patches (PSO*7*358, IB*2*434 and BPS*1*9) are being released in
 the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 5.0.  For more specific instructions please
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 The combined build will allow the processing and release of prescriptions
 for TRICARE active duty patients.
  
 This specific patch contains functionality for the following:
  
  1.  Create a bypass function to circumvent ePharmacy processing for
      TRICARE eligible inpatients.
  2.  Create new mail group, BPS TRICARE, to receive messages regarding
      the use of the new functionality.
  3.  Create a new reject code of "eT" in the BPS NCPDP REJECT CODE
      dictionary with a description of "TRICARE-DRUG NON BILLABLE".
      The new code will be used for TRICARE non-billable prescriptions
      that are sent to the Third Party Payer Rejects Worklist.
  4.  The following modification were made to the Process Secondary/
      TRICARE Rx to ECME option:
        4.1 Verify that the selected RX/Fill has a Primary claim that
            was previously submitted through ECME.
        4.2 Verify that the patient has valid ePharmacy coverage for
            Date Of Service for the RX/Fill.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview

 The post-installation routine is BPS10P9.  This routine will add a new
 entry into the BPS NCPDP REJECT CODE file (#9002313.93), the
 new entry will be TRICARE Reject code "eT".
  
 The post-installation routine is automatically deleted by KIDS if allowed
 by your local Kernel parameters configuration.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed when users are
 not on the system and during non-peak hours.  Of particular concern would
 be the items below.
  
     1. Do not queue this installation to run at a later time because you
        will be prompted to enter information during the installation.
     2. Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY
        BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job to finish or complete the
        installation before this job starts.
     3. Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmission starts.
        Check with Pharmacy Service or your pharmacy Automated Data
        Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to find out when
        CMOP transmissions occur.
     4. If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
        following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
        descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
        the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
