Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*421
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2*494
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*15
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0   PSX*2*74
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                     PRCA*4.5*295
  
 The patches (PSO*7*421, IB*2*494, BPS*1*15, PSX*2*74 and PRCA*4.5*295)
 are being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System 
 (KIDS) multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB PSX PRCA BUNDLE 8.0.
  
 The purpose of this software package is to ensure National Council for
 Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) D.0 - D.9 transactions are functional
 in the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) New Standards and Operating Rules 
 environment and includes annual External Code List (ECL) updates into
 NCPDP fields.
  
 The package also provides the ability to alert the pharmacist at the time of
 prescription processing regarding the days' supply benefit.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. VistA database is modified to allow for NCPDP codes containing an 
    alphabetic character in the first three characters of the code.
  
    For example, "B04-BT" is now a valid NCPDP code
  
 2. The VistA ePharmacy system is modified to support new data elements for
    NCPDP versions D.1 through D.9.  The new data elements are listed below:
  
    NCPDP ID    Description
    579-582     Associated prescription / service information.
    583-587     Service provider information:  name, address, city, state,
                 zip
    590         Seller initials
    591-677     Purchaser Information:  ID qualifier, Purchaser ID, gender
                 code, DOB, sex, city, state, zip
    678         Time of Service
    679-680     Seller ID and Qualifier
    681         Sales Transaction ID 
    A22         Patient ID state or province code
    A23         Purchaser relationship code
    A24-A27     Prescriber ID, alternate ID
    A28         Adjudicated payment type
    A29         Reported payment type May be outbound
    A30-A31     Released date, released time
    A32         Compound preparation time
    A43         Patient Country Code codes
    A45         Veterinary use indicator
    B04         Next available fill date
  
 3. New fields are added to data transmitted to ECME on an NCPDP claim:
  
        Pharmacist Initials (NCPDP code 590-YT)
        Time of Service (NCPDP code 678-Y6)
        Pharmacist Identifier (NCPDP code 679-Y9)
  
 4. Process and store new fields on incoming ECME response:
  
        Next Available Fill Date (NCPDP code B04-BT)
        Adjudicate Payment Type (NCPDP code A28-ZR)
  
 5. The ECME Claim Log is modified to display the next available fill date
    received in NCPDP field B04-BT.
  
 6. The ECME User Screen action to close a claim is modified to ask the 
    release copay question after the question on additional insurance.  
  
 7. The ePharmacy system is modified to no longer send "not processed for
    site" messages to the BPS TRICARE mail group for released TRICARE
    prescriptions.
  
 8. The ePharmacy system is modified to no longer send "not processed for
    site" messages to the BPS CHAMPVA mail group for released CHAMPVA
    prescriptions.
  
 9. The ePharmacy system is modified to no longer send "not processed for
    site" messages to the BPS OPECC mail group for released Veteran 
    prescriptions.
  
 10. A number of new routine APIs are created to allow ECME data to be read
     by Outpatient Pharmacy. These APIs are added to existing DBIA# 4719. 
  
 11. The port number sent in the ECME Registration message is changed from 
     the EPHARM OUT link port to the HL7 multi-threaded listener port.

  a. Update dictionary values in BPS NCPDP PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CODE
     (#9002313.21)
  
  b. Update NCPDP field definitions in BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS (#9002313.91)
  
  c. Update the NCPDP reject codes/descriptions in BPS NCPDP REJECT CODES
     (#9002313.93)    
  
 The pre-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if
 allowed by your Kernel site parameters configuration.  You may delete 
 routine BPS15PRE if the installation was successful and it is not 
 automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named
 POST^BPS15PST. The purpose of the post install routine is to:
  
  a. Remove the Drugs non covered report [IB DRUGS NON COVERED REPORT] 
     from the ECME transaction maintenance options [BPS MENU MAINTENANCE]
     parent menu.  
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if
 allowed by your Kernel site parameters configuration.  You may delete 
 routine BPS15PST if the installation was successful and it is not 
 automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should take less than a minute to install.
  
 DO NOT QUEUE the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted. Of particular concern are the options below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option. Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked. Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
