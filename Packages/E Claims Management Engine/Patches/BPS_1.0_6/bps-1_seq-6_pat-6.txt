Description:
============

 This patch is one of four patches to enhance the ePharmacy software, to 
 provide the framework to support Tricare and Active Duty outpatient 
 pharmacy billing.  The Tricare/Active Duty portions of this software 
 enhancement will not be active until a future patch is released.  The 
 release of the additional patch is pending the CBO and contracting with 
 the Tricare Fiscal Intermediary.
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along 
 with their associated patch number:
  
        APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
      --------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*66
  2.  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*287
  3.  ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*6
  4.  INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*383
  
 All four patches are being released separately with a requirement that 
 they be installed in the order outlined above.
  
 It is important that all four patches be installed completely one right 
 after the other. If they are not, you may see errors occur during the
 Outpatient prescription entry process.
  
 There are no other dependencies between these patches, except that
 Tricare/Active Duty billing will not be supported by ePharmacy until all 4
 patches are installed.
  
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they 
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO) or 
 are providing outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare or Active Duty 
 patients.  After the installation of these patches, the activation status 
 of the site will not be impacted.  Activation of the ePharmacy product
 will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not to activate
 ePHarmacy unless instructed specifically by the CBO.  Sites should not
 start to provide outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare without
 discussions with the CBO.
  
  
 This patch modifies the ECME v1.0 application as described below.  The
 modifications are labeled dormant in the software will remain inactive
 until the future Tricare patch is released.
  
 1.  ECME Status Message Changes (dormant)
 An update to the message displayed to the pharmacy staff when an ePharmacy
 claim is being submitted will display the word 'Tricare' indicating it is
 Tricare related.  Since the Outpatient Pharmacy package will process 
 rejects differently all Tricare claims 'E REJECTED' will also display the
 reject codes and description as shown below.
  
     TRICARE prescription 100665 submitted to ECME for claim generation
  
     Claim Status: 
     IN PROGRESS-Waiting to start
     IN PROGRESS-Building the claim
     IN PROGRESS-Transmitting
     E REJECTED 
        07 - M/I Cardholder ID Number
        12 - M/I Patient Location
  
  
 2.  Outpatient Pharmacy notifications
 An update to the API to Outpatient Pharmacy indicating what eligibility
 was determined for the prescription will notify the Outpatient Pharmacy
 package to treat Tricare related claims differently.
