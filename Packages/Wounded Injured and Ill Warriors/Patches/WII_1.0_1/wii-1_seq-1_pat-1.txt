Subject: Active Duty Adm & Disch to DFAS (WII)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  This patch must be installed by 02/27/2009 due to the high profile nature
  of this initiative. Transferring the information from VHA to DoD is
  required to ensure that DoD can correctly calculate pay to wounded Active
  Duty service members admitted to VHA facilities.
  
  The Department of Defenses (DoD) Wounded Warrior Pay Management Program 
  (WWPMP) has identified pay issues for Active Duty service members (SMs) 
  who are admitted to non military medical treatment facilities due to
  combat-related injuries.  The Department of Defense Finance and 
  Accounting Service (DFAS) has experienced difficulty in keeping
  accountability for this population and the lack of accurate
  accountability may adversely impact the pay of the SM.
  
  In the fall 2007, through a collaborative effort between the Department 
  of Veterans Affairs (VA), VHA and DFAS, VA and VHA agreed to provide
  defined data elements to DFAS to facilitate tracking of SMs admitted to
  inpatient VA facilities.  In February 2008 a memorandum of understanding
  (MOU) by and between VA and VHA and DoD/DFAS was executed.  The MOU
  established the authorities and agreement for the exchange of information
  relating to admission to and discharge from inpatient VA health care
  facilities of SM. This agreement is consistent with and supports the
  mission of the VA/DoD Joint Executive Council to improve the quality,
  efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of pay benefits to service
  members admitted to inpatient VA services.
  
  The WII (Wounded Ill and Injured) namespaced VistA application has been
  developed in order to provide an automated tool for identifying potential
  Active Duty patient admissions and discharges, and to transmit needed
  information on true Active Duty patients to a central collection point.
  It is being delivered to VA Medical Centers as patch WII*1*1.
  
  This new application is an interim solution, and requires user review and
  processing in order to identify actual Active Duty patients from a list 
  of potential patients generated by the software. A brief description of
  the process at VA Medical Centers is provided below:
  
  1. A Background job is tasked to run once a week at each facility. This 
  job collects data based on admissions and discharges that occurred during
  the collection period and the patients eligibility (TRICARE, SHARING
  AGREEMENT and OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY).  The qualifying entries are stored
  at the local facility in the new WII ADMISSIONS DISCHARGES file (#
  987.5).
  
  2. When the background job has completed processing, a VistA Mailman
  message is sent to the WII ADT REVIEWER mail group (created during the
  install) alerting mailgroup members that the facility either has entries
  that need approving or that there are no entries to approve.
  
  3. A point of contact at each facility reviews the data via the WII 
  REVIEW ADT EVENTS option, which employs a List Manager User interface.
  The reviewer is provided a list of potential Active Duty patients.
   
  4. Tools within the option provide the ability to expand the qualifying
  record (and review patient data to determine whether the patient is 
  Active Duty or not), Approve the Record if the patient is Active Duty, or
  Remove the Entry if the patient is not.  If the list is missing an entry
  the reviewer has the ability to add it to the list.  Please note that
  Adding a record to the local facility list will bypass the eligibility
  requirements (eligibility of TRICARE, SHARING AGREEMENT and OTHER FEDERAL
  AGENCY). In addition, the ability to Print the List of potential 
  patients, the list of DFAS Approved Pending, (patients flagged to
  transmit data) and Deleted ADT Events (patients removed from the list
  because they are not Active Duty) is also provided.
  
  5. Once the entries are approved at the local facility the reviewer
  releases the list for transmission to a central repository by exiting the
  option. From there, the list is compiled and then provided to DFAS via a
  secure, encrypted process.
  
  A User Manual and a National training effort will accompany the release 
  of the software.
  
  Important:  Please schedule the option named WII BUILD ADT EVENTS in
  ~~~~~~~~~   Taskman to run once a week (on a Sunday between 2 am and 5 am
              local time). Also, 
              please ensure the Point of Contact at your facility (and the
              backup POC) for this effort is added to the WII ADT REVIEWER
              mail group, and has the WII REVIEW ADT EVENTS option added to
              his or her Secondary menu.
  
  Below is an example of how to schedule the WII BUILD ADT EVENTS in Task 
  Manager.

 File and Global Information:
     There is one new global, ^WII.  The ^WII global contains the 
     following (2) new files.
                                                            Journaling

     987.6   WII PARAMETERS                 ^WII(987.6,     YES
      
     The ^WII global must be placed with the appropriate Read/Write 
     Global Access protection prior to installing this patch.
     Note:  This should be done even if global translations are in effect.
  
  
   Data Dictionary Changes
   =======================
   The following new files will be added:
  
   WII ADMISSIONS DISCHARGES FILE (#987.5)
   --------------------------------------------------
   
   The purpose of this file is to track admissions and discharges of Active
   Duty patients and to facilitate the notification of these movements to
   the DOD. This file is populated by the weekly back ground job [WII
   BUILD ADT EVENTS].  In order for a patient to be in this file, he
   or she must have one of three eligibilities entered in the Patient File
   (#2). TRICARE , SHARING AGREEMENT or OTHER FEDERAL AGENCY. 
  
   Entries that have a status of approved to transmit will be sent to the
   central repository for review and then roll up to the DOD. In the case
   of admission and discharge occurring in the same collection period there
   will only be one entry.  In the case that a discharge occurs in a
   subsequent collection period there will be a second entry.  Entries are
   dinum'ed to the Patient Movement file (#405).

   Options
   =======
   1. Review ADT Events [WII REVIEW ADT EVENTS] - This option allows the
   facility reviewer to remove and to approve Active Duty patient 
   movements that have occurred at your facility. Once the events are
   approved the data will be rolled up to the central collection point. 
  
   2. WII Build ADT Events [WII BUILD ADT EVENTS] - This option is to be
   scheduled via Taskman to run once a week. This option will run the
   routine WIIACT4 line tag EN.  This will insert qualifying entries 
   into the WII ADMISSIONS DISCHARGES (#987.5) file.  See the DD
   description for an expanded description.
  
   3. WII ADT Server [WII ADT SERVER] - This server option receives the
   sending facility's data and transmits the data to the central 
   repository.
  
   4. WII RPCS [WII ALL RPCS] - This is the option that contains all RPCs
   that will be used by the WII product.  At the current time there is
   only one RPC item listed; WII ADT.
  
  Remote Procedures
  =================
  1. WII ADT -  This remote procedure is run ONLY at the central 
  collection point. It generates a list of all admissions and discharges
  that have been transferred to the main collection point.  The RPC allows
  the user to select all entries that have not been sent to DFAS or
  regenerate the list by a date.  Data is extracted from the WII ADT ALL
  SITES FILE (#987.7).
  
   
   Pre-Install and Post-Install Changes
   ====================================
   Post Init WIIPOST.  This post init will populate the WII PARAMETERS FILE
   (#987.6) with the exported mail group WII ADT REVIEWER as well as the 
   central repository address.
