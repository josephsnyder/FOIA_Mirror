Description:
============

  
 In preparation for printing FDA Medication Guides, this patch adds
 the FDA MED GUIDE field (#100) to the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
 This patch does not enter data into this field.  Data is entered into this
 field as part of the monthly NDF Data Update patches. 
  
 This patch also adds the Display FDA Medication Guide
 [PSN MED GUIDE] option, to the National Drug File Menu [PSNMGR].
  
 This patch also creates a new Application Programmer Interface (API) for the
 National Drug File application (NDF) to return an FDA Medication Guide link.
 The call is S <variable>=$$FDAMG^PSNAPIS(ien).
  
 This patch also provides a new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) that will be used
 by subsequent Outpatient Pharmacy and NDF functions to display and/or print
 FDA Medication Guides.  The functions to utilize the new RPC will be
 provided in patches planned for release at a later date.  The RPC is named
 PSN FDA MED GUIDE PRINT QUEUE.
