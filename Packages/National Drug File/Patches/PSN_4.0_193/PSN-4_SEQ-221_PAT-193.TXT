  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 NOTE: Do not install this patch during the update process for any other 
 National Drug File patch.
  
 Patches PSN*4*193 and PSJ*5*214 are being released as part of the Class
 III to Class I conversion process.  In combination, the two 
 patches address the need to provide multidivisional functionality within
 the Inpatient Medications package's Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV]
 option. PSN*4*193 provides support within the National Drug File
 package adding a new cross reference.  PSJ*5*214 delivers the enhanced
 functionality of the Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option.
  
 Sites using Class III versions of this program are advised to begin using 
 the Class I version upon install of this patch.  There are no special 
 installation instructions for sites with the Class III version already 
 installed.
  
 PSN*4*193 will create the "AC" cross reference on the PARENT CLASS field 
 (#2) of the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605).
  
 The new cross reference is utilized by the Patients on Specific Drug(s) 
 Multidivisional Enhancements patch PSJ*5*214, a Class III to Class I 
 conversion project.
  
 With the "AC" cross reference, a user can identify all child drug classes 
 that belong to a selected parent class.
