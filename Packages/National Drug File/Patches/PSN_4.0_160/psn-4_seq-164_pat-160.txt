Subject: LOCAL FORMULARY REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects a problem that occurs when the NDF option Local 
 Formulary Report [PSNFRMLY] is printed by DRUG GENERIC NAME/TRADE NAME and
 sent to a spooled device. This patch also fixes a problem with the NDF
 option Inquire to National Files [PSNACT] so when doing a look up by NDC
 if data exists in the EXCLUDE DRG-DRG INTERACTION CK field for a VA
 Product, it is displayed.
