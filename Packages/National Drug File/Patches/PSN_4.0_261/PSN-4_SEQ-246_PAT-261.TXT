Description:
============

 This patch is being released in preparation for the Supra-Therapeutic 
 Dosages project. It contains the following 3 new fields that are being 
 added to the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68):
  
 1. CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40)
  
    Field Description:   
    ----------------- 
    Indicate whether Possible Dosages should be auto-created based on
    Dosage Form/Dispense Unit (Default) or if you want to control the 
    Possible Dosage auto-creation process for the Dispense Drugs 
    matched/re-matched to this VA Product.
  
    YES - Possible Dosages will be auto-created based upon Dosage
          Form/Dispense Unit combination (Default).
     NO - Possible Dosages will be auto-created according to the rule set
          by the POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE (#41) and PACKAGE (#42) fields.
  
 2. POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41)
  
    Field Description:   
    ----------------- 
    Indicate which Possible Dosages or if no Possible Dosages should be
    auto-created for Dispense Drugs matched/re-matched to this VA Product.
    This field is used only if the CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field
    (#40) is set to 'NO'.
  
        N - No Possible Dosages are auto-created for Dispense Drugs matched
            to this VA PRODUCT entry during the match/re-match process.
        O - Only 1x Possible Dosage is auto-created for Dispense Drugs
            matched to this VA PRODUCT entry during the match/re-match
            process.
        B - Both 1x and 2x Possible Dosages are auto-created for Dispense
            Drugs matched to this VA PRODUCT entry during the
            match/re-match process.
     
 3. PACKAGE (#42)
  
    Field Description:   
    ----------------- 
    Indicate the Package(s) use for the Possible Dosage(s) auto-created.
    This field is used only if the CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field
    (#40) is set to 'NO' and the POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is
    either set to 'O' or 'B'.
  
       I  - Possible Dosages auto-created for Dispense Drugs
            matched/re-matched to this VA PRODUCT entry will be available
            for the Inpatient application only.
       O  - Possible Dosages auto-created for Dispense Drugs
            matched/re-matched to this VA PRODUCT entry will be available
            for the Outpatient application only.
       IO - Possible Dosages auto-created for Dispense Drugs
            matched/re-matched to this VA PRODUCT entry will be available
            for both, Inpatient and Outpatient applications.
   
 In addition, a post-install routine will run to update the CREATE DEFAULT
 POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40) for every entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)
 with the default value of YES. The post-install routine will be 
 automatically deleted from the system upon completion of the installation.
  
 Updates to these new fields will happen automatically via the monthly
 National Drug File (NDF) Data Update patches.
