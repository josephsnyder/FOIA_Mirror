Description:
============

 This patch does the following:
 1. Adds the VAVCB entry to the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file.
     The VAVCB node is distributed with data in the following fields:
     
       NODE: VAVCB
       INSTITUTION: TEXAS VALLEY COASTAL BEND HCS
       LLP TYPE: TCP
       AUTOSTART: Enabled
       MAILMAN DOMAIN: VALLEYCOASTALBEND.MED.VA.GOV
       DNS DOMAIN: HL7.VALLEYCOASTALBEND.MED.VA.GOV
       EXCEED RE-TRANSMIT ACTION: restart
       TCP/IP ADDRESS: 10.140.159.37
       TCP/IP PORT: 5000
       TCP/IP SERVICE TYPE: CLIENT (SENDER)
       PERSISTENT: NO
       TCP/IP PORT (OPTIMIZED): 5001
  
     Note: AUTOSTART, MAILMAN DOMAIN, DNS DOMAIN and TCP/IP ADDRESS fields
           will only be updated in production account.
           At 'TEXAS VALLEY COASTAL BEND HCS' site, VAVCB node is a
           multi-listener.
  
 2. Rewords error descriptions as "Receiving Facility mismatch." and 
    "Receiving facility mismatch." to identify the error happened in 
    different code statement in routine HLTPCK2B as suggested by Rob
    Whelan (EIE).
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 Montana HCS
 CMOP-NAT
 North Texas HCS
 Orlando 
  
 Remedy:
 =======
 HD 388539: New logical link needed for new station. 
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (takes fewer than 5 minutes):
 ========================================================
 Note: only experienced installer should attempt the install.
  
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation. It 
       is highly recommended to install the patch during off-hours.
  
   2.  Disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners running on 
       all nodes in the cluster, for example, at the VMS prompt:
  
         ISC6A1> TCPIP
         TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE BAY_HLSP
         Note: BAY is the 3 letter site designation for Bay Pines.
          
   3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management options listed below:
  
         Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
  
   4.  Shutdown the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management
       option listed below:
  
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
   5.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   6.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       Apply 'Backup a Transport Global' option in case that the old
       routines may need to be restored.
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*148>
   
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
  
   7.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
       and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
       (Note those links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
       to be restarted manually.)
   
   8.  Restart the Link Manager, that was shutdown in step 4, using the
       Filer and Link Management option listed below:
  
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
   9. Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners, for example, 
      at the VMS prompt:
  
         ISC6A1> TCPIP
         TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE BAY_HLSP
         Note: BAY is the 3 letter site designation for Bay Pines.
  
  10. Routine HLP148 may optionally be deleted after installation.
