Associated patches: (v)HL*1.6*139  <<= must be installed BEFORE `HL*1.6*143'

Subject: HLO BUG FIX FOR SEQUENCE QUEUES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch HL*1.6*143 provides several corrections to the Health Level Seven
 Optimized (HLO) software.
  
  Test Sites:
  ===========
  MPI
  Montana HCS
  CMOP-NAT
  Oklahoma City
  
   
  Remedy:  
  ======
  HD0000000315881
  HD0000000315884
  
  
 Software Corrections:
 =====================
  
  1) Corrected an error described in Remedy ticket HD0000000315884.  On
     occasion, when adding a new message to a sequence queue, the queue fails
     to advance even though it is not waiting on the return of an application
     acknowledgment.
  
  2) Corrected an error described in Remedy ticket HD0000000315881 error. On
     occasion an application acknowledgment fails to be linked to the original
     message within the HLO MESSAGE VIEWER option.
  
  3) Corrected an error that was occasionally encountered by the message purge
     process.  If the first line of the message header was missing, the purge
     process encountered an error. 
  
  4) Corrected an error that allowed multiple identical copies of a message to
     be received and processed rather than treated as duplicates. The
     condition that allowed the error occurred only during an unusual set of
     circumstances involving system startup. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
        Installation time is under 3 minutes.  
        
    2.  Disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HLO multi-listener running on
        all nodes in the cluster. For example, at the VMS prompt in your
        production account:
  
          ISC6A1> TCPIP          <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE  
  
          In your test account:
  
          ISC6A1> TCPIP          <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5026CACHE  
  
         You could also do this from the M programmer's prompt as follows:
  
         VISTA> D ^%CLI   <-- at the M programmer's prompt                       
         CLI command: TCPIP                 
         TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE  
  
    3.  Use the STOP HLO option of the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen to
        temporarily stop the transmission of HLO messages. Wait several
        minutes to insure that all HLO processes have terminated.
  
        NOTE: There is a pre-install routine that will abort the installation
        if any HLO process is still running.  If the installation is aborted,
        verify that HLO is stopped, and restart the installation.
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
        The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
        the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
  
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
           Print Transport Global 
  
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
  
           Backup a Transport Global
  
           Install Package(s) 
  
        When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the patch
        build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions, and the
        answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*143>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
  
          and Protocols?  <NO>
   
       A pre-install routine will verify that all HLO processes have been
       stopped before the installation will complete. 
   
  
    6. Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners
  
          For example, in a production account at the VMS prompt:
          ISC6A1> TCPIP             <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE 
  
          For example, in a test account:
  
          ISC6A1> TCPIP             <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5026CACHE 
  
         You could also do this from the M programmer's prompt as follows:
  
         VISTA> D ^%CLI   <-- at the M programmer's prompt                       
         CLI command: TCPIP
         TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE   
  
    
    7. Use the START HLO option within the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen
       to resume transmission of HLO messages in your production account.
       This step is optional in test systems.
   
    8. On production systems, verify that outgoing messages have resumed
       being transmitted.  You can do this by monitoring the system via the
       HLO System Monitor for a few minutes to insure that the count of
       messages pending transmission is not growing.
  
    9. The routine ^HLOP143 may be deleted after the install is completed and
       you have verified that HLO has been restarted.
