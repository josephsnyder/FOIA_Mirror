Description:
============

 In the post-init routine this patch will add data for the Pharmacy Data
 Management Domain to the HDIS Domain file (#7115.1). It will also add data
 for the File/Fields being standardized for Pharmacy Data Management to the
 HDIS File/Field file (#7115.6) and File/Field multiple in the HDIS Domain
 file (#7115.1). These entries are being added to the files for VHA Unique
 Identifier (VUID) Seeding which is part of standardizing the Pharmacy Data
 Management files associated with the Pharmacy Data Management Domain. This
 data is also part of the Domain standardization process. Patch PSS*1.0*129
 will actually invoke the standardization VUID Seeding.  This patch is just
 in preparation for the Pharmacy Data Management patch.
