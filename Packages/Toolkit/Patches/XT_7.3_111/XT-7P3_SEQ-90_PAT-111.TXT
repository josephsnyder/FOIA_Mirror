Subject: DATA STANDARDIZATION (VUID) API SET

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is in support of Data Standardization's effort to allow the
 mapping of one term to another term.  Mapping of terms is done via the
 REPLACED BY VHA STANDARD TERM field (#99.97) and provides the high level
 goals of:
   1. Non-standard terms inheriting standardized characteristics
   2. Deprecating a term and replacing it with a new term
  
 This patch consists of an API set that:
   1. Maps one term to another term
   2. Obtains the term that another term is mapped to
   3. Extracts field values from the term that another term is mapped to
   4. Shows the mapping relationships that a term has with other terms

 =====================
 New APIs are documented in:
 - IA #5078 in the FORUM DBA Integration Agreements section
 - Toolkit-Data Standardization section of the Kernel APIs online Website:
