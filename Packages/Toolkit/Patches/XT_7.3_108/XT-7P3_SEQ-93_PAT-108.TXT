Subject: IMPROVE RESPONSE IN $$SCREEN~XTID

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch Tracking #: 49356926
 Test Sites: CENTRAL TEXAS HCS, COLUMBUS, OH(OPC), MARTINSBURG, WV
 Blood Bank Clearance: 09/10/2008
 Remedy ticket: 201109 
 Integration Control Registration #: 4631
  
 This patch improves the performance of the $$SCREEN^XTID function in ICR 
 # 4631.
  
 Problem:  The current implementation of the $$SCREEN^XTID function 
 becomes very inefficient when performing a data search or record 
 selection that involves a large number of entries.  It is suggested that 
 calls to the screen function that involves the same file be cached for 
 the duration of the call.
  
 Fix: Both the API and implementation have been changed so that the caller 
 of the function can pass a flag to indicate the need to use cached values 
 to improve the speed of the screen.  The new parameter in the function 
 should not affect existing application making use of the function. 
  
 This patch is in support of the VHA Data Standardization efforts, VHA 
 Unique ID (VUID).  Integration Control Registration # 4631 has been 
 updated to reflect this change.  Also, the online documentation for this 
 set of APIs has been updated and can be found at the following website, 
 under the 'Toolkit-VHA Unique ID (VUID)' section.

 Verification of Successful Installation and Test Plan:
 =====================================================
  
 There is no functional test that can be performed by the installing 
 site.  The site however can
  
 1. Verify that KIDS indicates a successful installation of the two 
    routines in this patch.
 2. Verify that the current applications using this API are not impacted.
    TIU, Vitals, and Allergies make use of the API being modified.  The 
    expected behavior of these applications is that 
  
    1) Selectable terms continue to be selectable
    2) Non-selectable terms continue to be non-selectable
  
 Installation:
 ============
  
 >>> TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
 >>> time to load and install is less than 5 minutes
 >>> Users of applications TIU, VITALS, and Allergies may be affected
     during installation of the patch.  If you need to avoid the users
     from receiving an "<EDITED>" error, install during off-hours.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
   3.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
       non-peak time.
       This patch can be queued and installed at any time.
       TaskMan can remain running.
  
   4.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
         Install Package(s)  'XT*7.3*108'
                              ==========
       Accept default answers for the following questions
  
       Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
  
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? 
       YES// NO
