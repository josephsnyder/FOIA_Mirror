Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*290
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*8
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*411
  
 These patches (PSO*7*290, IB*2*411 and BPS*1*8) will be released in the
 Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 4.0.  For more specific instructions please
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
 below:
  
 1. A modification was made to the Reject Information screen under the 
 Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option and the
 Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] option
 to display the Coordination of Benefits (COB) indicator in the insurance
 section if the insurance is not PRIMARY. The indicator will be displayed
 as "Coord. Of Benefits:" followed by COB indicator.
  
 Example:
  
    INSURANCE Information
    Insurance      : OPP INSURANCE            Coord. Of Benefits: SECONDARY
    Contact        :
    Group Name     : D-GROUP1
    Group Number   : D00001
    Cardholder ID  :
  
 2. A COB field(#27) was added to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52), REJECT INFO
 sub-file (#52.25) to store the COB for the Third Party Insurance Rejects
 for the fill. The Set of Codes will be stored as "1" for Primary, "2" for
 Secondary, and "3" for Tertiary. Tertiary billing will not be implemented
 with this patch group, but is included for future use.
  
 3. A modification was made to the Patient Medication Profile screen under
 the ePharmacy Medication Profile (View Only) [PSO PMP] option to modify
 the "Comments" line under the ECME LOG section from "Submitted to ECME:"
 to "ECME:" for non reversals. Second modification was made to add
 the insurance provider and the COB indicator as the suffix on the
 "Comments:." line.  The COB indicator will be denoted with a lower case
 "p" for Primary, "s" for Secondary and a "t" for Tertiary, which will be
 followed by the name of the insurance provider in capital letters.
  
 Example: 
    
    ECME Log:
  
    #   Date/Time           Rx Ref          Initiator Of Activity
    ==========================================================================
    1   1/28/09@11:37:56    ORIGINAL        OPUSER,ONE                        
    Comments:  ECME:WINDOW FILL(NDC:00046-1066-05)-E PAYABLE-pOPP INSURANCE
  
 4. For the Reject Information(UNRESOLVED) screen under the THIRD PARTY 
 PAYER REJECTS - WORKLIST [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option, the hidden menu 
 action PL for Print List was changed to be PT.  This was done to provide 
 consistency throughout the ePharmacy options.
  
 5. There is a known issue where the system may not automatically resubmit
 all claims rejected due to a host processing error. A test facility found
 where the software did not resubmit an electronic pharmacy claim
 automatically when a claim rejected for a host processing error. The
 following day the prescription was transmitted to CMOP as anticipated and
 was filled. The claim did appear on the ECME User Screen so it could be
 manually resubmitted, which is the process facilities followed before this
 patch was installed.  Based upon analysis, this is an infrequent scenario
 (less than 1%) and will only occur in a particular set of circumstances.
 This issue has been corrected in this patch.
  
 Host processing errors are identified by reject codes M6, M8, NN, and 99.
 The following conditions apply when this scenario occurs.
  
      a. The transmission of the Rx/fill will be delayed 1 day in hopes
         that the host processing issues will be resolved.
      b. An activity log entry will be made documenting the date/time along
         with a comment stating that the Rx/fill was left in suspense hold 
         due to a host processing error.
      c. This added functionality does not include the Pull Early from
         Suspense function.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket:
 -------------------------------------------------
 1. HD348938  Bug in 'Print from Suspense File'
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Minneapolis reported the lock command in routine PSOSULBL does not lock a 
 global variable but instead locks a local variable.  While this works as 
 intended in a single server environment, it does not work in a 
 multi-server environment where other servers in the VistA cluster would 
 not recognize this lock.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the lock so that the system is locking a global ^XTMP variable 
 instead.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
      specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation 
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.
  
 The documentation distribution includes:

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed when users are not
 on the system and during non-peak hours. The installation time should be
 less than 10 minutes. Of particular concern would be the items below.
  
     1.  Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
         by the BPS Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY
         BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job to finish or complete the
         installation before this job starts.
     2.  Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being transmitted
         to CMOP or printed locally from suspense. Wait for the CMOP
         transmission to finish or complete the installation before the
         transmission starts.  Check with Pharmacy Service or your pharmacy
         Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to find
         out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
     --------------
     Obtain the host file BPS_1_8_PSO_IB.KID, which contains the following
     three patch installs:
  
         BPS*1.0*8
         PSO*7.0*290
         IB*2.0*411
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_8_PSO_IB.KID host file is located in the anonymous.software
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
