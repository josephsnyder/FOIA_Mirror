 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD122245   Editing Provider Comments/Patient Instructions.
  
 Problem:
 --------
  After copying provider comments larger than one line into the patient 
  instructions, attempting to edit would fail and only allow overwriting 
  the entire set of instructions.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
  Remove use of the variable PSOINSFL as it appears to be no longer used 
  and not containing a correct value would cause the edit of a multi
  line patient instructions to be handled by a single line editor with
  an incorrect previous entry.
  
  
 2) HD179234   Issue with selecting service related option.
  
 Problem:
 --------
  In some cases using the Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges option [PSOCP 
  RESET COPAY STATUS] to edit copay exemption flags would appear to not
  hold the changes. The cause of this is the mismatch of exemption flags on
  the IBQ and ICD nodes of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
  Edit routine PSOCPC to kill off the IBQ node and only set it when it is 
  necessary.
  
 3) HD196315   Error - <UNDEFINED>SETNEW^PSOBINGO
  
 Problem:
 --------
 While adding new prescriptions to the Bingo board, an undefined error
 can occur if a one of the cross references by patient name is "Bad".  It
 points to an entry that is no longer on the Bingo board.  It is not known
 how the cross reference remains there after the entry has been removed.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 While loading a new entry and checking for duplicates on the Bingo board, 
 the routine PSOBINGO will also check first to see if the entry exists that
 is pointed to by the cross reference. If it does not exist then the cross
 reference will be deleted.  The routine will continue on to adding the 
 new entry.
