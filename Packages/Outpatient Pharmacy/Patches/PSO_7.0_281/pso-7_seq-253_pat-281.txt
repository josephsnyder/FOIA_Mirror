Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) system that supports the Electronic Claims 
 Management Engine (ECME).  It is the first of four stand alone patches
 that will fulfill the requirements of ePharmcy/ECME Enhancements Phase 4 
 Iteration II.  It modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application as
 described below:
  
  
 1.  EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE (VIEW ONLY) [PSO PMP] option has been
 modified in the following manner:
  
     a.  Patients flagged with the Bad Address indicator will display the
         same warning messages as PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM
         BACKDOOR ORDERS] option. If the user holds the PSO ADDRESS UPDATE
         key, a prompt to update the address/phone will be displayed. If 
         the site parameter EDIT PATIENT DATA under Site Parameter
         Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option is defined as YES, the
         prompt to update the address/phone will always be displayed.
  
  
     b.  The PU - Patient Record Update action has been added to the
         Patient Medication Profile screen.  To achieve this, the 
         PU action was added to the PATIENT MEDICATION PROFILE protocol
         menu [PSO PMP MENU].
  
         The following actions have been removed from the Patient 
         Medication Profile screen by removing them from the PATIENT
         MEDICATION PROFILE protocol menu [PSO PMP MENU]:
  
              DR         Sort By Drug
              ID         Sort By Issue Date
              LF         Sort By Last Fill Date
              RX         Sort By Prescription
  
     c.  The above removed actions have been added to the hidden actions
         menu by adding them to the ePharmacy Medication Profile Hidden 
         Actions [PSO PMP HIDDEN ACTIONS MENU] protocol.
  
     d.  The REJ View Reject action was added to the hidden menu on the Rx
         View screen.  The ePharmacy Hidden Actions Menu #2 [PSO PMP HIDDEN
         ACTIONS MENU #2] protocol was added to contain this new action,
         and this protocol is also used by the VIEW PRESCRIPTION option
         [PSO VIEW].
  
  
 2.  The default answer of (I)gnore on the Reject Processing Screen has 
 been changed to (Q)uit which automatically sends the claim rejection  
 information to the Pharmacy Reject Worklist (i.e. re-instate discontinued 
 order, unhold, refill, PP - pull early from suspense, edit that doesn't 
 create a new order, and release with NDC edits). Due to conflicting patch
 release schedules and shared routines with another Pharmacy patch, the new
 order, copy, edits that create new orders, and renewal functions will
 remain with a default answer of (I)gnore for reject processing screens
 displayed prior to label print. These functions will be updated in a
 subsequent ePharmacy Iteration II patch when the conflict no longer
 exists.
  
 3.  The VIEW PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option has been modified to give 
 comprehensive help text for the VIEW PRESCRIPTION prompt.  The REJ View
 Reject action was added to the ePharmacy Hidden Actions Menu
 # 2 [PSO PMP HIDDEN ACTIONS MENU # 2].
  
 4.  The ECME LOG was recording the routing of WINDOW for all original 
 fills and refills.  A modification was made to correctly state the route 
 for each fill that is processed after this patch is installed.  The 
 PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,  VIEW
 PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option, and EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE (VIEW 
 ONLY) [PSO PMP] option is affected by this change.
  
 5.  The ECME Log entry that is stored when a prescription is printed
 from suspense has been changed from stating ECME:SUSP LABEL PRINTED to 
 ECME:PRINTED FROM SUSPENSE.  This change will affect fills processed 
 after this patch has been installed.  
  
 6.  A change was made to allow the user to edit Dispensed As Written (DAW)
 and National Drug Code (NDC) fields for expired and discontinued ePharmacy
 prescriptions and refills.
  
 7.  A modification was made to store the last used NDC for payable 
 prescriptions that were pulled early from suspense.  This change affects
 the PULL EARLY FROM SUSPENSE [PSO PNDRX] option and the PP Pull RX action
 of the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
  
 8.  A post install routine (PSO260PI) from PSO*7.0*260 will be deleted 
 with this patch.
