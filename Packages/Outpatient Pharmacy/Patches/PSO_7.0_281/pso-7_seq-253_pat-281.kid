"BLD",7337,1,21,0)
        menu [PSO PMP MENU].

"BLD",7337,1,23,0)

    d.  The REJ View Reject action was added to the hidden menu on the Rx

        ACTIONS MENU #2] protocol was added to contain this new action,
"BLD",7337,1,39,0)
        and this protocol is also used by the VIEW PRESCRIPTION option
"BLD",7337,1,40,0)
        [PSO VIEW].
"BLD",7337,1,41,0)
 
"BLD",7337,1,42,0)
 
"BLD",7337,1,43,0)
2.  The default answer of (I)gnore on the Reject Processing Screen has 
"BLD",7337,1,44,0)

information to the Pharmacy Reject Worklist (i.e. re-instate discontinued

order, unhold, refill, PP - pull early from suspense, edit that doesn't 
"BLD",7337,1,47,0)
create a new order, and release with NDC edits). Due to conflicting patch
"BLD",7337,1,48,0)
release schedules and shared routines with another Pharmacy patch, the new
"BLD",7337,1,49,0)
order, copy, edits that create new orders, and renewal functions will
"BLD",7337,1,50,0)
remain with a default answer of (I)gnore for reject processing screens

PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,  VIEW
"BLD",7337,1,64,0)
PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option, and EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE (VIEW

the PULL EARLY FROM SUSPENSE [PSO PNDRX] option and the PP Pull RX action
"BLD",7337,1,79,0)
of the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
"BLD",7337,1,80,0)
 
"BLD",7337,1,81,0)

pharmacy (ePharmacy) system that supports the Electronic Claims 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
Management Engine (ECME).  It is the first of four stand alone patches
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
that will fulfill the requirements of ePharmcy/ECME Enhancements Phase 4 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)

"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
described below:
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
1.  EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE (VIEW ONLY) [PSO PMP] option has been
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
modified in the following manner:
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
    a.  Patients flagged with the Bad Address indicator will display the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
        same warning messages as PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
        BACKDOOR ORDERS] option. If the user holds the PSO ADDRESS UPDATE
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
        key, a prompt to update the address/phone will be displayed.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
    b.  The PU - Patient Record Update action has been added to the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
        Patient Medication Profile screen.  To achieve this, the 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
        PU action was added to the PATIENT MEDICATION PROFILE protocol
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
        menu [PSO PMP MENU].
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
        The following actions have been removed from the Patient 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
        Medication Profile screen by removing them from the PATIENT
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
        MEDICATION PROFILE protocol menu [PSO PMP MENU]:
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
             DR         Sort By Drug
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
             ID         Sort By Issue Date
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
             LF         Sort By Last Fill Date
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
             RX         Sort By Prescription
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
    c.  The above removed actions have been added to the hidden actions
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
        menu by adding them to the ePharmacy Medication Profile Hidden 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
        Actions [PSO PMP HIDDEN ACTIONS MENU] protocol.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
    d.  The REJ View Reject action was added to the hidden menu on the Rx
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
        View screen.  The ePharmacy Hidden Actions Menu #2 [PSO PMP HIDDEN
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
        ACTIONS MENU #2] protocol was added to contain this new action,
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
        and this protocol is also used by the VIEW PRESCRIPTION option
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
        [PSO VIEW].
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
2.  The default answer of (I)gnore on the Reject Processing Screen has 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
been changed to (Q)uit which automatically sends the claim rejection  
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
information to the Pharmacy Reject Worklist (i.e. re-instate discontinued 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
order, unhold, refill, PP - pull early from suspense, edit that doesn't 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,47,0)
create a new order, and release with NDC edits). Due to conflicting patch
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,48,0)
release schedules and shared routines with another Pharmacy patch, the new
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,49,0)
order, copy, edits that create new orders, and renewal functions will
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)
remain with a default answer of (I)gnore for reject processing screens
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,51,0)
displayed prior to label print. These functions will be updated in a
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,52,0)
subsequent ePharmacy Iteration II patch when the conflict no longer
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,53,0)
exists.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,54,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,55,0)
3.  The VIEW PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option has been modified to give 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,56,0)
comprehensive help text for the VIEW PRESCRIPTION prompt.  The REJ View
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,57,0)
Reject action was added to the ePharmacy Hidden Actions Menu
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,58,0)
# 2 [PSO PMP HIDDEN ACTIONS MENU # 2].
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,59,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)
4.  The ECME LOG was recording the routing of WINDOW for all original 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,61,0)
fills and refills.  A modification was made to correctly state the route 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,62,0)
for each fill that is processed after this patch is installed.  The 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,63,0)
PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,  VIEW
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,64,0)
PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option, and EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE (VIEW 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,65,0)
ONLY) [PSO PMP] option is affected by this change.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,66,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,67,0)
5.  The ECME Log entry that is stored when a prescription is printed
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,68,0)
from suspense has been changed from stating ECME:SUSP LABEL PRINTED to 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,69,0)
ECME:PRINTED FROM SUSPENSE.  This change will affect fills processed 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,70,0)
after this patch has been installed.  
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,71,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,72,0)
6.  A change was made to allow the user to edit Dispensed As Written (DAW)
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,73,0)
and National Drug Code (NDC) fields for expired and discontinued ePharmacy
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,74,0)
prescriptions and refills.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,75,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,76,0)
7.  A modification was made to store the last used NDC for payable 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,77,0)
prescriptions that were pulled early from suspense.  This change affects
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,78,0)
the PULL EARLY FROM SUSPENSE [PSO PNDRX] option and the PP Pull RX action
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,79,0)
of the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,80,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,81,0)
8.  A post intall routine (PSO260PI) from PSO*7.0*260 will be deleted 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,82,0)
with this patch.
