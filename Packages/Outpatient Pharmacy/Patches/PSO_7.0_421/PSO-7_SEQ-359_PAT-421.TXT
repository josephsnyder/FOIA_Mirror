Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH

 The patches (PSO*7*421, IB*2*494, BPS*1*15, PSX*2*74 and PRCA*4.5*295)
 are being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System 
 (KIDS) multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB PSX PRCA BUNDLE 8.0.
  
 The purpose of this software package is to ensure National Council for
 Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) D.0 - D.9 transactions are functional in the
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) New Standards and Operating Rules 
 environment and includes annual External Code List (ECL) updates into
 NCPDP fields.
  
 The package also provides the ability to alert the pharmacist at the time of
 prescription processing regarding the days' supply benefit.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. The ePharmacy Site Parameters screen is converted to a List Manager
    screen and the following additional changes made:
    
    a. The "Allow All Rejects" question is removed.
  
    b. An action to copy parameters to another division is added.
  
    c. An action to display parameters for multiple divisions is added.
  
    d. An action to select another division for view/edit is added.
  
    e. Actions are included to edit General Parameters and Transfer Rejects. 
  
    f. An action is included to edit all sections of the screen. 
  
    g. A new section for Reject Resolution Required reject codes is added 
       and allows add, edit or delete rejects and the associated threshold 
       amount.
  
 2. ePharmacy Site Parameters screen now requires a NEW security key PSO
    EPHARMACY SITE MANAGER instead of security key PSORPH.
  
 3. Claim rejection processing for the New Order action is modified to use
    the new Reject Resolution Required reject codes in the ePharmacy Site
    Parameters screen. 
  
    A reject notification screen is displayed if the prescription is for 
    original fills, Veteran eligibility, not released prescriptions and 
    where the reject code is on the Reject Resolution Required list for the
    current division, and the total gross amount of the prescription is at
    or above the specified threshold.      
  
 4. Processing for Reject Resolution Required reject codes is also added 
    when a claim rejection for a prescription is received in the Edit Rx 
    action from the medication profile or the reject information screen. 
    Processing triggers a reject notification screen. 
                                                             
 5. A new section "REJECT RESOLUTION REQUIRED" is added to the Third Party
    Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option, which contains
    prescriptions with Veteran eligibility and with active Reject Resolution 
    Required rejects.
  
 6. Discontinued TRICARE and CHAMPVA prescriptions no longer appear on 
    the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST]. 
  
 7. The Reject Information screen is modified to display the following
    additional fields:
  
        - Both NCPDP and NPI numbers.
  
        - Next Available Fill Date (received in NCPDP field B04-BT).
  
        - Comment to indicate a Reject Resolution Required reject was
          automatically transferred to the Third Party Payer Rejects 
          Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST].
  
        - Back-bill Indicator for back billed claims (BB) or billed claims
          that have been processed through action PRO - Process Secondary/
          TRICARE Rx to ECME [BPS COB PROCESS SECOND TRICARE] (P2, P2S).
  
        - Date of Service that was sent on the claim that resulted in the
          rejection.     
  
 8. The 3/4 day supply functionality to calculate a suspense date when the
    Renew (RN) Action feature is used.  
  
 9. Format of display for field Quantity of Previous Fill (531-FV) via
    action ARI View Addtnl Rej Info value is changed. The field value is
    divided by 1000, includes a decimal if appropriate, and strips off 
    leading zeros before being displayed.
  
 10. Submit Multiple Actions (SMA) action within the Third Party Worklist -
     [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option is changed to allow default Reason Code
     values to be deleted.

 #2406 - ePharmacy Prescriptions Not Printing From Suspense
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 HD0000000786401 - CHAMPVA prescription labels not printing
 HD0000000830940 - CHAMPVA prescriptions remaining in local suspense
 HD0000000831438 - CHAMPVA prescriptions not pulled on 'Print From Suspense'
  
 Note: All of these Remedy tickets are describing the same problem and it 
 affects both CHAMPVA and TRICARE prescriptions remaining in local suspense 
 incorrectly when the labels should be printed.
  
 1. HD0000000786401 - CHAMPVA prescription labels not printing
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Facilities have reported ePharmacy prescriptions for CHAMPVA and TRICARE 
 patients that are not being pulled from suspense when the Print from Suspense
 File [PSO PNDLBL] option is used. Cases reported have been for either CHAMPVA 
 or for TRICARE prescriptions processed for local filling. The problem happens
 when a payable claim is placed back into suspense. This action triggers an ECME
 reversal transaction, which usually creates an ECME status of REVERSAL ACCEPTED
 (instead of PAYABLE).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Code modification is needed in function ECMESTAT^PSOBPSU2. For TRICARE/CHAMPVA 
 prescriptions where the current ECME status is not PAYABLE, apply a coding fix 
 so that these prescriptions will print either if they have no rejects, or if
 all rejects have been overridden. Any unresolved rejections for TRICARE/CHAMPVA
 prescriptions (either billable or non-billable) will continue to prevent labels
 from printing from suspense.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named
 POST^PSO7P421. The purpose of the post-install routine is to:
  
  a. Delete ALLOW ALL REJECTS field (#1) and any 79/88 reject codes from
     EPHARMACY SITE PARAMETERS file (#52.86)
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if
 allowed by your Kernel site parameters configuration.  You may delete 
 routine PSO7P421 if the installation is successful and if it is not 
 automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should take less than a minute to install.
  
 DO NOT QUEUE the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted, Outpatient Pharmacy Prescription Processing,
 and Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) Activity is taking place.
 Of particular concern are the options below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option. Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked. Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
