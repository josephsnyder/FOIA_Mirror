Subject: PARTIAL NOT COMING ACROSS PROPERLY, DRUG TRANSACTION HISTORY REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues in Outpatient Pharmacy:
  
 1.  The Drug Transaction History [PSA DRUG DISPLAY] menu option is showing
     the outpatient prescriptions that are dispensed for all pharmacy
     locations under only one pharmacy location when the prescription is
     dispensed through the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI).
  
 2.  The mailman message that gets generated when the release of a
     discontinued prescription is attempted does not make the distinction
     between a regular and a partial fill.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000211124 - Drug accountability report not collecting data
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Drug Transaction History [PSA DRUG DISPLAY] menu option is showing the
 outpatient prescriptions that are dispensed for all pharmacy locations
 under only one pharmacy location when the prescription is dispensed
 through the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOHLDIS and PSOHLDI1 have been modified to get the outpatient 
 location for each prescription that is dispensed through OPAI, and to 
 show that dispensing under the correct pharmacy location.
  
  
 2) HD0000000296665 - Partial not coming across correctly
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When attempting to release a discontinued partial Rx, user gets a
 mailman message that does not mention whether the Fill was partial.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 MAIL^PSOHLDI1 has been modified to solve this issue. Now in the mailman
 message, the word "Partial" will display in the "Fill" field when the 
 release of a discontinued partial Rx is attempted.
