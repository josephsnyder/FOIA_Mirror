Subject: MOCHA 2.0 FOLLOW-UP

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is part of a group of host file patches that make up the new
 Medication Order Check Healthcare Application v2.0 (MOCHA). These patches
 contain software that supports MOCHA v2.0 functionality.  The host files
 were created to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration
 (VHA) facilities. 
  
  
 Patch Information:
 ------------------
 The following patches will be distributed in a phased release and sites 
 will be given access to the host files during their scheduled phase of 
 implementation:
  
   1. PSS_1_160.KID
   2. PSS_1_173.KID
   3. MOCHA_2_0.KID contains: PSO*7*372, PSJ*5*252, and OR*3*345
   4. MOCHA_2_0_FOLLOW_UP_COMBINED_BUILD.KID contains: PSO*7*416,
         PSJ*5*257, GMRA*4*47, and OR*3*311.
   5. OR_3_381.KID
   6. MOCHA_2_0_FAST_TRACK_BUILDS.KID contains: PSJ*5*299, PSO*7*431
  
 To find out your wave deployment status, please see:
  
 http://vaww.oed.portal.domain.ext/projects/pre/PRE_M2_Deploy_Trng/PRE_VA_User_
 M2_Deploy_Trng/SitePages/Home.aspx
  
 PSS_1_160 and PSS_1_173 include the components necessary for the
 interface that will be used in MOCHA v2.0.  The MOCHA 2.0 and 
 MOCHA 2.0 FOLLOW UP COMBINED BUILD include the modifications to implement
 Max Single Dose Order checks for the Order Entry Results Reporting (OERR),
 Inpatient Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy applications.
  
 When OR*3*311 is installed, (Install step 4 of the MOCHA v2.0 
 build), the 'before' checksum of routine ORCMED will be incorrect, as 
 will the second line of that routine because it will not include patch 
 OR*3*380. The functionality of patch OR*3*380 will also be overwritten. 
 However, when OR*3*381 is installed (step 5 of the MOCHA v2.0 build), 
 that will correct the second line, and restore the functionality from 
 OR*3*380.
  
 These patches will add a maximum single dose order check to the current
 VistA medication order checking system that uses the First DataBank (FDB)
 business logic and database. In this initial phase of dosing
 functionality, the Maximum Single Dose information will be displayed to
 the user.  The following scenarios describe the types of messaging added:
  
   1. If the dosage entered passes the dosing checks, no message will be
      displayed.
  
   2. If the dosage entered is too high, the Single Dose warning
      message will be displayed.
  
   3. If the dose checks were not able to be performed, a generic message
      will be displayed notifying the user that a manual check needs to be
      completed to verify appropriate dosing.
  
  
 Additionally PSO*7*416 includes subsequent defect corrections or patch
 incorporations for nationally released patches. The following are
 additional updates included in this patch:
  
 1.  Incorporate modifications made in PSO*7*391 ePrescribing patch which 
     is part of ePrescribing build PSO_PSD.kid.
  
 2.  Incorporation of PSO*7*413.
  
 3.  Incorporation of PSO*7*378.
  
  
 *************************************************************************
 When using the option Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD 
 COMPARE TO SYSTEM] with the host file MOCHA_2_0_FOLLOW_UP_COMBINED_BUILD 
 you will see the following warnings on certain routines:
  
 Host file: MOCHA_2_0_FOLLOW_UP_COMBINED_BUILD.KID contains: PSO*7*416, 
 PSJ*5*257, GMRA*4*47, and OR*3*311
  
 PSO*7*416:
  
 Routine: PSOCAN, PSOCAN2, PSODDPR2, PSODDPR4, PSODDPR5, PSODDPRE, 
 PSOORED3, PSOORED5, PSOORNEW, PSORXEDT, PSOVER1
 *** WARNING, you are missing one or more Patches ***
  
 These warnings are due to the sequence of released patches prior to MOCHA 
 2.  Once all the MOCHA 2.0 patches are installed, the second lines of the 
 routines will be updated appropriately.
