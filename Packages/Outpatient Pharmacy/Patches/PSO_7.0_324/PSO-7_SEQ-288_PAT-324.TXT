Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The FY09 Q3 Enhancement Release includes the following.
  
 1. PSI-07-134 (PSPO #771) - Remedy Ticket # HD200301/HD217962
  
 In Outpatient Pharmacy during order entry when there is no allergy 
 assessment on file for a patient, the user will be given the ability to
 duplicate the allergy intervention data filed for the last drug.
 In order to provide this functionality, during subsequent allergy 
 intervention, this patch will now prompt
 "No Allergy Assessment - Do you want to duplicate Intervention? Yes//"
  
 If the answer is "No," then it will prompt for a new intervention.
  
 If the answer is "Yes," then it will display the last intervention
 entered. The following is an example.
  
 INTERVENTION DATE: DEC 11, 2008       PATIENT: PSOPAT,NAME
 PROVIDER: PSOPROV, NAME               PHARMACIST: PSOPHARM, NAME
 DRUG: "current order drug name"       INSTITUTED BY: PHARMACY
 INTERVENTION: ALLERGY                 RECOMMENDATION: OTHER
 ORIGINATING PACKAGE: OUTPATIENT       DIVISION: OKLAHOMA CITY VAMC
  
 Would you like to edit this Intervention? No//
  
 If "No," then the system accepts the intervention and continues.
 If "Yes," then the system allows editing of the intervention.
  
  
 2. PSI-07-181 (PSPO# 865) - Remedy Ticket # HD326589
  
 A prescription's (Rx) strength was changed in Computerized Patient Record
 System V. 1.0 (CPRS) creating a new Rx. The original Rx had been 
 transmitted to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) on the 
 previous day. When finishing, the pharmacist missed the previous day's 
 transmission to CMOP of the original prescription. Both Rxs were mailed 
 to the patient in the same package from the CMOP.
  
 When a CMOP prescription with a status of Transmitted or Retransmitted is
 discontinued by a background process to the Outpatient Pharmacy options,
 e.g. CPRS or Registration V. 5.3 packages, then an email notifying that a
 prescription was just discontinued for that Rx will be sent to the new PSX
 EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS mail group created by patch PSX*2*68 (see
 PSX*2*68 patch description for details). If no recipients are defined in
 the new mail group, then it will be sent to PSXCMOPMGR key holders. The
 email alert will inform the group that the CMOP status for the Rx just
 discontinued was either Transmitted or Retransmitted as seen in the
 example below.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 When a CMOP prescription with a status of Transmitted or Retransmitted is
 discontinued by a foreground Pharmacy process due to a duplicate drug 
 scenario that would trigger the duplicate to be discontinued, then the
 Processing Status field of the duplicate drug message is highlighted to
 alert the user. Below is an example.
