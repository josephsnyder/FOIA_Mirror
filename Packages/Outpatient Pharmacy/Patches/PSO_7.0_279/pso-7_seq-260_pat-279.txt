 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000226478  Field missing in NTE segment of HL7 for PMI
 Problem:
 --------
 The NTE segment of the Health Level 7(HL7) message generated that 
 contains the PMI was missing the identifying piece and did not match the
 documentation or format of other NTE segments.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Change the code that generates the NTE segment for the dispense request 
 to include the identifier and match the documentation
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 Modify routine PSOHLDS4 at the NTEPMI tagline to correct the format of 
 the HL7 message.
  
  
 2) HD0000000214848 Incorrect wording:  Division used to describe
                                        Institution
 Problem:
 --------
 Under the [PSO RX] Rx(Prescriptions) menu, if you want the Order Summary, 
 there is a prompt asking "Do you want the summary by Division or Clinic:"
 This is incorrect, Division should be Institution.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Correct the question by changing Division to Institution.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 Change routine PSOORNE1 to reflect that the summary is by Institution
 instead of Division.
  
 3) HD0000000216000  PSOAUTRF Key
 Problem:
 --------
 The PSOAUTRF key is not listed in the technical manual. The key's 
 description also needs clarification.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Update the technical manual to include the key PSOAUTRF. Also, change 
 the description of the key itself.
