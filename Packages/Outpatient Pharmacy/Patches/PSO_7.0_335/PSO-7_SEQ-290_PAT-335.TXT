Subject: PROBLEMS WITH PSO INTERNET REFILL REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 The Internet Refill Report generates a list of all Internet Refill prescriptions
 that can be sorted by Patient, Date, or Result for one division or for all.
 The report can be printed in detail or summary format.  Currently, the "RESULT"
 sort displays inconsistent results in the summary format.
  
  
 Associated Remedy Ticket(s):
 ============================
 HD0000000265420 - The numbers are not consistent in PSO INTERNET REFILL REPORT

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000265420
  
 The numbers are not consistent in PSO INTERNET REFILL REPORT when sorted by 
 "RESULT".  The values for the summary report using this sort are inconsistent
 and do not agree with the values from the PATIENT and DATE sort.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The data is compiled and placed into a temporary global for print.  The file
 parameters vary depending on the sort.  The report sorted by "RESULT" is over-
 writing data during the compile.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSOATRR.  An additional parameter is added to the "RESULT" sort
 so that data is not overwritten.
