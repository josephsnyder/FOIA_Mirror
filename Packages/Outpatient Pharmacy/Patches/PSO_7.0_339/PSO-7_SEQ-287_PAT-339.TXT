Subject: PHARMACY API PSO52API TRIGGERS ERROR

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 *** INFORMATIONAL PATCH ONLY ***
  
 This patch notifies all sites of a change to the documentation for 
 Pharmacy API PSO52API.  The previous documentation did not state that the 
 API not only returns data, but can also modify data in the PRESCRIPTION 
 FILE (#52).
  
   
        NAME: RX^PSO52API
     PACKAGE: Pharmacy (Re-Engineering API)
  
 DESCRIPTION: This API has defined one entry point by parameter passing to
              return prescription data from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  
       ISSUE: This API does more than return data. It also modifies data in
              the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD0000000325092 - Outpatient Pharmacy API changing data.    
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When a VAMC attempted to install test patch IB*2*400 in their test 
 account, a post-install encountered an error.  While the actual error was
 an ePharmacy error, the error was triggered by the Pharmacy Re-Engineering
 Encapsulation API (RX^PSO52API).  What occurred during the post-install of
 the test IB patch is a lookup of data using the supported Pharmacy API in
 file 52.  
  
 The API doesn't just look up data, it may also perform an update/change 
 to data in the Prescription file (#52). During the post-install a
 prescription was found in the site's test system that was billed using
 ePharmacy but not yet released when the test system copy was made.  From
 there the API changed the status of the prescription to EXPIRED. When the
 status changed, a call was made to the ePharmacy API which attempted to
 reverse the previously submitted ePharmacy claim from the insurance payer.
 Since this was a test account, the attempted reversal resulted in an 
 error.
  
 The error, as reported in Remedy HD0000000325092, was addressed in patch 
 BPS*1*7.   A change was made to the following ePharmacy API: BPSNCPDP.   
 This modification ensures that no error occurs in TEST accounts during 
 future installs of IB*2*400.
  
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The documentation for RX^PSO52API will be modified to indicate that it changes
 data in the Prescription file (#52).
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 The revised PHARMACY RE-ENGINEERING (PRE) APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE 
 (API) MANUAL is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
 the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These files should
 be retrieved in binary format.
     
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from 
      the first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
      Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
      The documentation distribution includes:
  
      File Name:    PHAR_1_API_R0110.PDF
