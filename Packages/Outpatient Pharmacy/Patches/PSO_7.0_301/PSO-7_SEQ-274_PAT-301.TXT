Subject: SPEED RENEW DISPENSING WRONG DRUG

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  
  This patch will correct a problem that is happening when using the     
  PSO SPEED RENEW protocol.  If PSO SPEED RENEW is used for the renewal  
  of an existing prescription after renewing a different prescription,   
  the wrong drug information may be erroneously added to the renewal.    
  This causes the prescription to seemingly be renewed normally, however 
  upon dispensing, the wrong NDC (National Drug Code) number will be     
  used and a dispensing machine will give out the wrong drug.            
                                                                         
  
 **************************************************************************
 * This patch is a follow up to PSO*7.0*302, released 4/01/2008, which    *
 * disabled the PSO SPEED RENEW protocol until a fix could be made to     *
 * correct the problem with dispensing the wrong drug.  The problem with  *
 * the PSO SPEED RENEW protocol is now fixed with PSO*7*301 and once      *
 * installed pharmacy staff will be able to use the PSO SPEED RENEW       *
 * protocol option.                                                       *

                                   Outpatient Pharmacy
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Using the protocol PSO SPEED RENEW for the renewal of an existing 
 prescription after viewing another prescription may cause the wrong 
 drug information to be erroneously added to the renewal. This causes 
 the prescription to seemingly be renewed normally, however upon 
 dispensing, the wrong NDC (National Drug Code) number will be used and a
 dispensing machine will give out the wrong drug.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Clear the old drug information each time, before doing a speed renew.
 *This patch will re-enable the speed renew option*
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 The array PSODRUG was not getting reset and therefore causing 
 pre-existing date to be retained.  Routine PSORENW4 will be modified 
 to kill off the array for each renewal.
  
 This patch also removes "TEMPORARILY OUT OF USE via PSO*7*302" from the
 DISABLE field (#2) of the PSO SPEED RENEW entry in the PROTOCOL file
 #101).
