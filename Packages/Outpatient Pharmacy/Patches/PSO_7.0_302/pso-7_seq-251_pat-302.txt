Subject: DISABLE SPEED RENEW

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch is to disable the Speed Renew Feature until a correction is 
  released in PSO*7*301 which is the PSI patch. This feature was causing a
  problem where the wrong NDC number gets copied into a prescription. This
  is potentially dangerous as the wrong drug may be dispensed by an
  automated dispensing robot.
  
  ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
  ==================
  HD220858 - PSO*7*301 (PSI-07-227) - Error Filling Prescriptions in
                                      Outpatient Pharmacy
  d HD231034 - Wrong script information
  d HD237297 - HL7 prescription issue
  
  
  REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
  =======================
  1) HD220858 - PSO*7*301 (PSI-07-227) - Error Filling Prescriptions in
                                         Outpatient Pharmacy
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Creating a speed renew of an existing prescription after viewing another 
  prescription would cause the wrong drug information to be erroneously 
  added to the renewal. This would cause the prescription to seemingly be
  renewed normally, however upon dispensing, the wrong NDC number would be
  used and a dispensing machine would give out the wrong drug.
  
  Resolution:
  ----------- 
  Because of patch dependencies, this is a partial correction which will
  disable the PSO SPEED RENEW protocol until a follow up patch can be 
  released to complete the correction and re-enable the protocol.
  
  Technical:
  ----------
  This patch simply adds "TEMPORARILY OUT OF USE via PSO*7*302" to the
  DISABLE field (#2) of the PSO SPEED RENEW entry in the PROTOCOL file
  (#101).
