Description:
============

 The FY09 Q2 Enhancement Release includes the following.
  
 This patch provides the ability to view a patient's remote prescription
 data within Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 using the Remote Data
 Interoperability (RDI) interface to retrieve data from the Health Data
 Repository (HDR).
  
 The following changes were made.
 1. In the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,
    if a patient has remote prescription(s), then the user will be prompted
    with the following question.
  
           REMOTE PRESCRIPTIONS AVAILABLE!
           Display Remote Data? N//
  
    If the response is "No", then there are no changes to the existing 
    functionality. If the response is "Yes" then it provides a new screen 
    to view the remote data as shown in the following example.
