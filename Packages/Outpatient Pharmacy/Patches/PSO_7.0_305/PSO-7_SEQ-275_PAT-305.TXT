Description:
============

 The FY08 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the following enhancements.
  
 1. Automate Computerized Patient Record System V. 1.0 (CPRS) Refill
    Processing.
 2. Display of both the Fill Date and the Release Date.
 3. Duplicate Drugs Message Enhancements.
 4. Notice of Privacy Practice Reminder on Laser Labels.
  
 ***** NOTE TO SITES USING AUTOMATED FILLING EQUIPMENT *****
 This patch adds a new NTE8 HL7 (Health Level 7) segment that has the VA
 Notice of Privacy Practices, IB 10-163 narrative to the content of the
 laser labels print stream.  If you are using automated dispensing
 equipment that relies on the data stream sent to the laser labels port,
 you have to contact your vendor to make adjustments to the trailer page as
 defined in item #4 below.
  
 1. Automate CPRS Refill Processing
 ==================================
 This patch provides functionality to automatically process refills placed
 by the provider via CPRS.  A new system parameter, AUTOMATE CPRS REFILLS
 field (#40.16), has been added to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) by the
 Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0, patch PSS*1*137 to support this 
 functionality.
  
 Please refer to patch PSS*1*137 for more details.
  
 The auto refill process will occur only if the new AUTOMATE CPRS REFILLS
 field (#40.16) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) is set to YES and the
 security key, PSOAUTRF, has been assigned to at least one user; otherwise
 the current process will continue where the orders have to be finished
 manually. Orders processed automatically will have the refill date 
 calculated by the refill process to the next possible fill date and the
 routing will be set to Mail.
  
 During the auto refill process, if the criteria for refilling fails, then
 the order will not be processed but will be stored in the PENDING 
 OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) for manual processing. Also, a MailMan
 message, with the reason for not filling the auto refill, will be sent to
 holders of the PSOAUTRF security key. This should be very rare since CPRS
 will allow refills only if they are refillable.
  
 2. Display of both the Fill Date and the Release Date
 =====================================================
 On the Patient Medication Profile screen, new functionality was
 implemented to allow users to have the option of viewing either the FILL
 DATE or the RELEASE DATE information. This is done by using a hidden
 ListMan action called RDD to invoke the RELEASE DATE display and will
 remain for that session. Using the RDD action again will display the FILL
 DATE.
  
 3. Duplicate Drugs Message Enhancements
 =======================================
 This enhancement is related to patient safety issue PSI-07-236 and remedy 
 ticket RT223633. When a duplicate drug message is displayed, the heading 
 "CMOP Status" is currently shown for CMOP drugs only. This heading is 
 being renamed to "Processing Status" and it will appear on every duplicate
 drug message along with the release status.
   
 4. Notice of Privacy Practice Reminder on Laser Labels
 ======================================================
 When the labels are printed for a patient's prescriptions, the
 following narrative will be printed on the trailer page in either English
 or Spanish, depending on the patient's language preference.
  
 The English version reads as follows.
  
   The VA Notice of Privacy Practices, IB 10-163, which outlines your
   privacy rights, is available online at http://www1.va.gov/Health/ or you
   may obtain a copy by writing the VHA Privacy Office (19F2), 810 Vermont
   Avenue NW, Washington DC 20420.
  
 The Spanish language translation for the Privacy Notification reads as 
 follows.
  
   La Notificacion relacionada con las Politicas de Privacidad del
   Departamento de Asuntos del Veterano, IB-10-163, contiene los
   detalles acerca de sus derechos de privacidad y esta disponible
   electronicamente en la siguiente direccion:
