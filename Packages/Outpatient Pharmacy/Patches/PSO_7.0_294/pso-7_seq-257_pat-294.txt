Subject: MEDICATION RECONCILIATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch TIU*1*238 must also be installed to set up and use the Medication
 Reconciliation Tools.
  
 This patch introduces the components necessary to build four tools
 useful for medication reconciliation.
 There is setup that must be done before the tools can be used.  Please
 refer to the Medication Reconciliation Tools Implementation Guide for
 instructions on building the components.
  
 Tool 1 is a Medication Reconciliation Profile health summary component.
 This report creates an alphabetical list of outpatient prescriptions,
 unit dose medications, documented non-VA medications, and remote VA
 medications.  This summary can be used at transition points in a patient's
 care, (admission, discharge, etc.) to identify medications that need to
 be continued, new items to be ordered, old items to be discontinued, or
 orders that need to be changed.
  
 Tool 2 is a Medication Worksheet component.  This report
 provides a grid-formatted list of active and pending medications suitable
 for giving to a patient at a clinic visit or upon discharge from the hospital.
  
 Tool 3 is a TIU data object provided as an alternative to the Medication
 Chart health summary process.  The unique aspect of this object is that
 the list, generated for the patient, includes recently expired
 medications but not recently discontinued medications.
  
 Tool 4 is a series of TIU data objects and health summary components that
 retrieve remote active medications and remote allergy/ADR data.

  available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly
  from a specific server as follows:
