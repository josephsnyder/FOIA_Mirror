Subject: INCLUDE PID-4 IN OPAI

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
  This patch is being released with a 5 day compliance date.  It is
  important that this patch be installed no later than the compliance date
  to ensure Veterans with new VHIC cards are recognized by vendor products.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 This patch incorporates the PID-4 component in OPAI messaging for the new 
 VHIC (Veteran's Health Information Card) card, formerly known as VIC card,
 to provide interoperability.  The changes in HL7 message generated by OPAI
 are tested with ScripPro and Optifill only.  Sites using other vendors are
 requested to inform them of the changes, so that they can make necessary
 changes to ensure smooth running of interface at their sites
  
  
  
 Issue #1:  When patients presented at the pharmacy to pick up their 
 outpatient medications sites utilizing the OPAI interface and COTS 
 products such as ScriptPro and OptiFill rely on patient identifying 
 information contained in the PID segment of HL7 messages.  Because the 
 new VHIC card no longer contains the patient's social security number, 
 there was no common identifier between the barcode on the VHIC card and 
 data in the HL7 PID segment.
 Solution:  The patch DG*5.3*874 provides the functionality to include the 
 PID-4 component that contains the VHIC card value(s).  This patch 
 utilizes that patch to include the current active VHIC card numbers in 
 the HL7 PID-4 component.
  
 Issue #2:  OPAI vendors have difficulty in determining where drug warning 
 labels break between multiple drug warnings which is in the NTE #3 of the 
 HL7 interface.
 Solution:  The separator value of /.sp/ is being added between warning 
 labels in the NTE #3 where warning labels are placed.
