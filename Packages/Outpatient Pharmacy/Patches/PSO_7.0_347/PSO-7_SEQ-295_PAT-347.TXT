 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1)     HD0000000324738 - (PSPO-1424) Suspended CMOP prescriptions
         are not showing up in Vista as suspended (on Patient Profile)
         DUPLICATES:  HD0000000328016
                      HD0000000353715
   
 Problem: 
 ========
 A pharmacist finishing electronically entered prescriptions for a patient,
 entered S to suspend the prescription at the Label prompt.  The prescription
 did not suspend nor did a label print.  When the pharmacist reviewed the 
 prescription it was set to the status of Active.
 When processing prescriptions, if there are prescriptions for multiple 
 patients being processed, it only looks at the information for the patient 
 of the first prescription.  If that patient has a Mail Code of 2 - Do not 
 mail, 3 - Local Regular Mail or 4 - Local Certified Mail and the Mail 
 Status Expiration Date is in the future or does not exist, none of the 
 prescription being processed will be suspended.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modify the code so the patient for each prescription being processed is
 checked for their mail code and process accordingly.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 =====================
 Modify tags TEST and LOOP of routine PSOCMOP to move the patient check to 
 inside the loop that processes each prescription.
