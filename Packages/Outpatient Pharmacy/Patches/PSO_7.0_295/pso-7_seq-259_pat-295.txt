 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1)  HD0000000227215    Release after DC in Optifill
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The mail group PSO EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS was set up as type Private
 which is causing the users of the group to not receive the mail messages.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The mail group PSO EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS needs to be modified by the 
 organizer of the group. Edit the Mail Group using menu option Manage 
 Mailman, Group/Distribution Management, Mail Group Edit.  At the Select 
 MAIL GROUP NAME: prompt enter PSO EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS. You may 
 select the default values of Select Members, Member Type, Description, 
 and Edit Option.  The next prompted option is TYPE.  Change this to 
 Public if it is set to Private.  After changing this to Public you will 
 then be prompted to ALLOW SELF ENROLLMENT?:.  Set this to No, so users 
 are not able to add themselves to the mail group.  Allowing users to add 
 themselves could be a breach of security and privacy if they receive the 
 messages. 
  
 **Note**:  If you are asked to add the mail group, select No then proceed 
 to contact the organizer of this mail group.
  
 Below are two different examples of implementation of this patch.  The 
 first scenario is normal implementation and the second is if you were 
 asked to add the Mail group.
