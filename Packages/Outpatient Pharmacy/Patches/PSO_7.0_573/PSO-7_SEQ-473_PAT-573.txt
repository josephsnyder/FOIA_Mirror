Subject: DUPLICATE RX CREATED IN PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue:
       
 When using the Outpatient Menu Option PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS 
 it is possible to create a duplicate prescription during the entry process
 by editing the drug name before the order is complete. 
           
      
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 HITPS-6725
                     
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------   
 INC6161343 - Duplicate active prescriptions for duplicate 
 medications appearing in outpatient prescriptions file (file #52).
      
 Duplicate Tickets:
 INC6162652
 INC6164757
      
       
 Problem:
 --------
 In menu option Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS], 
 a patient has an active prescription for an orderable item.  The user 
 creates a new Rx for a different drug for the same orderable item.  If 
 the user edits the drug and duration while creating this new Rx then a 
 duplicate Rx will be created.
      
 Resolution:
 ------------     
 A modification has been made in routine PSODRGN to execute a duplicate 
 drug check when the drug and duration is changed during edit of a 
 prescription.
  
     
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Biloxi VAMC
 Miami VAMC      
      
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------    
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 the Outpatient Pharmacy users be off the system.  Other VISTA users
 will not be affected.   Install Time - less than 2 minutes (unless 
 otherwise indicated)
  
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu select Backup a Transport Global.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSO*7.0*573):
  
 4. From the Installation Menu you may elect to use the following
    options and choose the patch when prompted:
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
        backup any other changes, such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ====================
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines 
 of the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
   ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Validation of Back-out Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Back-out Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*573 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*573 in the patch list section on line 2

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 2

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSODRGN
    Before: B11617807   After: B12386647  **268,422,573**
