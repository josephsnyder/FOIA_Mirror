 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:

 The last three patches (PSO*7*289, IB*2*384 and BPS*1*7) will be released 
 in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 3.0.  Patches PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 will 
 be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an implementation 
 dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches, PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 must be installed prior to the 
 installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions please 
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
 below:
  
 1.  A modification was made to prevent users from entering a suspense date
 that is greater than the fill date plus 90 days.  Dates where the fill
 date plus 90 days is greater than the expiration date will not be allowed.
  
 2.  Functionality to allow non-DUR/RTS reject to be placed on Third Party 
 Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option was added.  To 
 accomplish this the following additions were made:
  
     a.  A new EPHARMACY SITE PARAMETERS FILE (#52.86) was added to store
         ePharmacy specific parameters by division.  Along with this file, 
         a new EPHARMACY SITE PARAMETERS [PSO ePHARM SITE PARAMATERS]
         option was added for entry/edit of parameters.  Regardless of any
         parameters defined in this new file, Refill-Too-Soon (RTS), Drug
         Utilization Review(DUR) and Tricare rejects will always be placed
         on the Pharmacy Reject Worklist.
  
         Sites will have the ability to select to allow all third party 
         rejects to pass to the the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist
         which is also referred to as the Pharmacy Reject Worklist or they
         can choose to specify individual reject codes. Individual third
         party reject codes can be defined to be automatically placed on
         the worklist or defined to require OPECC intervention. If the site
         chooses to allow all rejects to be placed on the worklist,
         individual codes are overridden but not deleted from the file.
  
      b. For display of non-DUR/RTS rejects for the Third Party Payer
         Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option, rejects passed
         via OPECC manual intervention will be denoted in the comment
         section of the Reject Information screen as:
  
         - JUN 09, 2008@14:04:18 - Transferred by OPECC. (user,name)
  
     
         Rejects passed automatically will be denoted in the comments 
         section of  the Reject Information Screen as 
  
        - JUN 09, 2008@16:00:09 - Automatically transferred due to override
          for reject code. (user,name)
  
         All rejects other than Refill-Too-Soon, DUR, and Tricare will be 
         displayed at the end of the listing under "OTHER REJECTS"
         header. The "OTHER REJECTS" header will be displayed regardless of
         whether the GI - Group Insurance action is toggled on or off.  
         
         Non-DUR/RTS rejections will be resolved with the existing
         functionality and will be resubmitted to ECME in the same manner
         as DUR/RTS rejections.
  
 3.  A modification was made to not allow a claim to be reversed through 
 ECME for an unreleased CMOP fill when the prescription/fill is 
 discontinued. If the fill is either a CMOP released or Non-CMOP released 
 fill the reversal will be performed.  Because the software already 
 performs a reversal for unsuccessful/not dispensed claims, no changes are 
 needed for reversing discontinued non-dispensed fills.  Also, no changes 
 are needed when the NDC from CMOP differs from the NDC on the claim 
 because this function is already performed by existing software.
  
 4. New functionality was added to prevent prescriptions from being 
 filled/sent to CMOP when a host processing error occurs when a claim is 
 submitted through ECME. The host processing errors are identified by 
 reject codes M6, M8, NN, and 99. The following conditions apply when this 
 scenario occurs.
  
     a. The transmission of the Rx/fill will be delayed 1 day in hopes
        that the host processing issues will be resolved.
     b. An activity log entry will be defined to state the date/time 
        along with a comment stating that the Rx/fill was left in suspense
        hold due to a host processing error.
     c. This added functionality does not include the Pull Early from 
        Suspense function.
  
 NOTE:  There is a known issue where the system may not automatically
 resubmit all claims rejected due to a host processing error.  A test 
 facility found where the software did not resubmit an electronic pharmacy 
 claim automatically when a claim rejected for a host processing error.  
 The following day the prescription was transmitted to CMOP as anticipated 
 and was filled.   The claim did appear on  the ECME User Screen so it 
 could be manually resubmitted, which is the process facilities followed 
 before this patch was installed.  Based upon analysis, this is an 
 infrequent scenario (less than 1%) and will only occur in a particular set
 of circumstances.   This issue will be fixed in the next ePharmacy patch
 release. 
  
 5. New functionality was added to the Print from Suspense File [PSO
 PNDLBL] option to prevent ePharmacy prescriptions from being printed 
 from suspense or transmitted to CMOP until 3/4 of the days supply of the
 Rx/fill has elapsed. The system will not hold a prescription for 3/4 days
 supply when:
  
     -   the previous fill was not ECME billable
     -   the Rx is flagged for SC or EI
     -   the DEA special Handling code is non billable (i.e. has M or 0 
              (zero) or  (I, S, N, and/or 9)) without an E.
     -   the Rx is a zero fill on a renewal
     -   the patient does not currently have insurance
  
 6. A modification was made to PRESCRIPTION file (#52), REJECT INFO 
 sub-file (#52.25), CLARIFICATION CODE field (#24). This was a set of codes
 field.  It is now a pointer to file #9002313.25 (BPS NCPDP CLARIFICATION
 CODE).  A post install routine will go through the reject info subfile and
 convert the old set of code values to the appropriate new pointer values.
 The post install will send a mail message to the person installing the
 build which details the affected rejected prescriptions.  The 'Submit
 Clarif. Code' protocol [PSO REJECT DISPLAY CLARIFICATION CODE] has been
 altered to use the new pointer value.
  
 7. The 'Edit NDC and DAW Code of Discontinued/Expired Prescriptions' 
 functionality introduced in PSO*7.0*281 has been extended to also allow 
 edits of prescriptions with a status of DISCONTINUED BY PROVIDER and 
 DISCONTINUED (EDIT).
  
 8. New functionality was added to create a nightly background mail 
 message regarding open/unresolved rejects on the reject worklist.  The 
 'Third Party Payer Rejects - Nightly Message' option [PSO REJECTS 
 BACKGROUND MESSAGE] will be queued to run every 24 hours by the post 
 install routine.  This option is intended to be a stand alone option and 
 should not be placed on any menu.  The message will be delivered to the 
 'PSO REJECTS BACKGROUND MESSAGE' mailgroup; this mailgroup should be 
 populated with appropriate ePharmacy users to receive the information.  
 Mail messages are generated for each division. Sites may alter EPHARMACY
 SITE PARAMETERS file (#52.86) REJECT WORKLIST DAYS field (#4) for each 
 division using the ePharmacy Site Parameters option [PSO EPHARM SITE 
 PARAMETERS] of the ePharmacy Menu.  If no sites are defined in the 
 EPHARMACY SITE PARAMETERS file (#52.86), no message will be generated.  
 This parameter may be defined to be 1 to 30 days that an uncommented
 reject can remain on the reject worklist without being included in the
 nightly reject worklist alert mail message.  The following are the
 criteria for a reject to be included in the mail message:
  
     a. The prescription is active, suspensed, expired, or on hold.
     b. The prescription is unreleased.
     c. The claim has been on the Reject Worklist for more days than the
        value in the REJECT WORKLIST DAYS field for the division.
     d. The claim has no comments added within the date range.
  
 9. New functionality was added to allow NDC validation of third party
 payable prescriptions by pharmacy technicians.  Current functionality
 requires a pharmacist to perform this task.  In addition, for the
 PRESCRIPTION file(#52) and the REFILL sub-file (#52.1), the DATE NDC
 VALIDATED field (#83) and NDC VALIDATED BY field (#84) will be captured
 when the NDC is validated for a prescription or refill; this validation
 information will be displayed when prescriptions are released; if the NDCs
 have not been validated, that information will be displayed instead.  The
 'NDC Validation' option [PSO NDC VALIDATE] has been added to the ePharmacy
 Menu for use by technicians.  The option will work as follows:
  
     a. The technician will be prompted to scan or enter a prescription 
        number.  An '^' may be entered to halt the option.
     b. The system will evaluate the Rx.  If the Rx NDC has already been 
        validated, the technician will be prompted if they wish to
        revalidate. If the answer is yes, the technician will be allowed to
        proceed.  If the answer is no, the technician will be returned to
        the select a prescription prompt.
     c. If the Rx is CMOP, external interface or released, the user will
        not be allowed to validate the NDC.
     d. The system will display information about the Rx, notate that the
        Rx has not been previously validated and will prompt for PRODUCT 
        NDC. A valid PRODUCT NDC must be entered for this prompt.  Valid
        PRODUCT NDC's are those defined for the drug in Drug file (#50) as
        an NDC of a synonym or the default NDC.
     e. The system will compare the Rx NDC to the PRODUCT NDC submitted on
        the initial ePharmacy claim.  If the NDCs do not match, the system
        will reverse and resubmit a third party claim with the new NDC and
        store the new NDC on the fill.
     f. If the prescription is defined as TRICARE and is not payable, the 
        system will display an appropriate message and the technician will be 
        returned to the select a prescription prompt.
     g. If the prescription is defined as TRICARE and the reversed claim 
        returns not payable, the system will display an appropriate message and 
        the technician will be returned to the select a prescription prompt.
     h. Otherwise, the system will update the NDC validation fields for the
        Rx/Fill, and the technician will be returned to the select a
        prescription prompt.
  
 10.  The RES - Resubmit Claim action was added to the Reject Information
 (TRICARE) screen of the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS
 WORKLIST] option.
  
 11.  The following functionality will work only if the REGISTRATION
 package V.5.3 patch DG*5.3*688 that introduces the COUNTRY field to the
 PATIENT file (#2) is installed:
  
    When using the Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option, if the
    routing is MAIL and the address is Foreign, it will be treated just
    like the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR or DO NOT MAIL order where:
  
    a. The prescription will not be sent to the automated filling equipment
       and/or to the label printer. The fill will remain on suspense until
       it is pulled early, the routing is changed to window, or the address
       is changed.
  
    b. For the first time attempt to print from suspense, an entry will be
       added to the activity log and a MailMan message will be generated to
       the user who queued the job to print from suspense and the members
       of the PSO EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS mail group.
  
 12.  When the NDC changes during auto-release of the prescription for CMOP
 or OPAI fills, the fill date on the fill will be updated to become the
 same as the release date.  An entry will be made in the activity log for
 the fill to denote the changed date.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
      specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation 
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 In preparation for installation, determine the name of the person who will
 be the Coordinator for the mailgroup "PSO REJECTS BACKGROUND MESSAGE".  
 This person is typically someone who deals directly with ePharmacy claims 
 rejection resolution.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed when users are 
 not on the system and during non-peak hours.  Of particular concern would
 be the items below.
  
     1.  Installation can NOT be queued because there is user input
         required during the installation.
     2.  Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
         by the BPS Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY
         BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job to finish or complete the
         installation before this job starts.
     3.  Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being 
         transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish 
         or complete the installation before the transmission starts.

 1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
     --------------
     Patches PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 will be sent to your system upon
     release from the National Patch Module.
  
     Obtain the host file BPS_1_7_PSO_IB.KID, which contains the following
     three patch installs:
  
         BPS*1.0*7
         PSO*7.0*289
         IB*2.0*384
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_7_PSO_IB.KID host file is located in the anonymous.software
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
