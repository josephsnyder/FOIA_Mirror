Description:
============

 This patch is one of four patches that enhance the ePharmacy software to 
 provide the framework to support Tricare and Active Duty outpatient
 pharmacy billing.  The Tricare/Active Duty portions of this software
 enhancement will not be active until a future patch is released.  The
 release of the additional patch is pending Central Business Office (CBO)
 contracting with the Tricare Fiscal Intermediary.
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along 
 with their associated patch number:
  
        APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
      --------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*66
  2.  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*287
  3.  ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*6
  4.  INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*383
  
 All four patches are being released separately with a requirement that 
 they be installed in the order outlined above.  
                       
 It is important that all four patches be installed completely one right 
 after the other. If they are not, you may see errors occur during the
 Outpatient prescription entry process.
  
 There are no other dependencies between these patches, except that
 Tricare/Active Duty billing will not be supported by ePharmacy until all 4
 patches are installed.
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they 
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the CBO or are providing outpatient
 pharmacy services to Tricare or Active Duty patients.  After the
 installation of these patches, the activation status of the site will not
 be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy product will require
 instructions provided by the CBO, and sites are not to activate ePharmacy
 unless instructed specifically by the CBO.  Also, sites should not start
 to provide outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare patients without
 discussions with the CBO.
  
 This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
 below.  The modifications are labeled dormant in the software and will
 remain inactive until the future Tricare patch is released.
  
 1.  (Dormant) - Prescriptions where the patient is Tricare eligible will
 be submitted to ECME for third party insurance processing in the same
 manner as all other insurance types.  Tricare eligibility is determined by
 Integrated Billing (IB). An indicator is returned to Outpatient Pharmacy
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and REFILL multiple (#52.1) to be stored in the
 new BILLING ELIGIBILITY INDICATOR field (#85).  Because this is a set of
 codes field, the internal value will be T, V or C. These values will be
 displayed respectively to the user as TRICARE, VETERAN, or CHAMPVA. Note
 that CHAMPVA will not be addressed in this patch.  Prescriptions with only
 a 'VETERAN' eligibility flag are what is currently processed through ECME.
  
 2.  (Dormant) - When a Tricare prescription has a third party rejection,
 the same reject notification screen will be displayed to the user as is
 currently done for the Veteran eligibility.  Tricare Rejections will be
 stored in the same manner as Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and
 Refill-too-soon (RTS) prescription reject are currently stored.
  
 The following exceptions will apply for Tricare prescriptions:
  
     A.  All Tricare rejections will be denoted as Tricare in the REJECT 
         Information header on the Reject Information screen.
  
     B.  Where DUR or RTS are one of the reject codes, the user will be
         able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription, submit 
         (O)verride codes, or (Q)uit which sends the rejection to the Third
         Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.  Tricare rejection may not be
         (I)gnored.
  
     C.  For prescription rejections that have non-DUR/RTS rejects, the
         user will be able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription or
         (Q)uit which sends it to the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.
  
     D.  For non-billable Tricare prescriptions, an abbreviated version of
         the reject notification screen will be displayed.  Because the
         prescriptions is non-billable, the insurance and ECME information
         that's currently provided for DUR/RTS rejects will not be
         displayed (i.e. insurance, group name, group #, ECME #, contact,
         cardholder ID).  In this case, the user will only be able to
         (D)iscontinue the prescription due to the business rule that OP
         cannot fill Tricare prescriptions that are non-billable.
  
     E.  Labels will not print for discontinued Tricare prescriptions.
         Reprint labels will not be allowed to be printed for Tricare
         rejected prescriptions. 
  
     F.  Suspended prescriptions will remain on suspense when a reject
         occurs, when the Rx is non-billable, or when the third party claim
         remains in an 'IN PROGRESS' status in ECME.  Labels will not
         print.  Once the reject is resolved, the user may pull the Rx 
         early from suspense or wait for the next scheduled print from
         suspense runs at which time labels will print accordingly. This
         includes CMOP and local suspense.
  
     G.  Rejected Tricare prescription may not have a partial fill ordered 
         until the reject is resolved.
  
     H.  When the  Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option is used, 
         Tricare prescriptions will be processed in the foreground and
         rejections will be displayed for user intervention.
  
  
 3.  (Dormant except for item C.) - The Third Party Payer Rejects -
 Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option and the Third Party Payer Rejects -
 View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options have been modified in the
 following manner:
  
      A. Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejections will be segregated at the end of
         the displayed information. They will be denoted with a "TRICARE -
         Non-DUR/RTS" header.  This header will remain regardless of
         whether the GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on or off.  
         The Tricare section will sort in the same manner as the main sort
         for non-Tricare prescriptions (i.e. by Rx, drug, patient, etc.).
   
      B. Tricare DUR/RTS rejects will be displayed with all other DUR/RTS
         rejects.  When GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on, the
         header "TRICARE" will be displayed, and this "TRICARE" section
         will sort alphabetically within the other insurances.  This
         Tricare section is separate from the Non-DUR/RTS section that
         displays at the end of the listing.  When GI is toggled off, these
         rejects will sorted in the same section as all other DUR/RTS
         rejects.
  
      C. (Not dormant) - The new TRI - Show/Hide Tricare toggle action has
         been added to the hidden menu on the Insurance Rejects screen.  
         When toggled to Show, Tricare Non-DUR/RTS rejects will be
         automatically displayed at the end of the listing.  Toggling the
         TRI action to Hide will remove them from the screen.
  
      D. The Reject Information screen has been modified to display TRICARE
         in the header for the Reject Information section.  For DUR/RTS
         Tricare rejects, the IGN - Ignore Reject action will be shown but
         will not be selectable. For Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejects, the FIL -
         Fill Rx action will be displayed. If the prescription is payable,
         the user will be allowed to fill the prescription and print the
         label.  If not payable, a message will be displayed stating that
         the prescription must have a payable status to be filled.
  
      E. For rejects that remain in suspense, the user will be allowed to
         process the rejection as indicated above, however no labels will
         be printed until the prescription is pulled early or printed from
         suspense.  Upon resolving the reject, the user will be notified
         of this information.  CMOP prescriptions will function in the same
         manner.
  
 4.  In preparation for a future ePharmacy patch the following fields are 
 being added to PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for original fills and refills:
 DATE NDC VALIDATED field (#83) and NDC VALIDATED BY field (#84).  
  
 5.  For ePharmacy prescriptions, the price per dispense unit for the
 NDC will be saved in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  For original fills, the  
 UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#17) will be updated.  For refills, the CURRENT
 UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#1.2) of REFILL multiple (#52.1) will be
 updated. If the NDC chosen is the default NDC, the value stored will be
 taken from PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).  If the
 NDC selected is a synonym, the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#404) of
 SYNONYM multiple (#9) of DRUG file (#50) will be saved. In the case of
 CMOP fills, only the default NDC price will be stored which is taken from
 PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).
  
 6.  (Dormant) - If ECME's status on the claim remains in an "In Progress"
 state past the processing time out during finish of the prescription,
 Tricare prescriptions will not be allowed to be filled and must be
 discontinued or sent to the Third Party Payer Reject - Worklist.
  
 7.  (Dormant) - If the pharmacy is active for ePharmacy processing but the
 insurance plan is not linked or not active, Tricare prescription will be
 allowed to be filled normally.  The phrase "Inactive ECME Tricare" will be
 displayed during Finish.
