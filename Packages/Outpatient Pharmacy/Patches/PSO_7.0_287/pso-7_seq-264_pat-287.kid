This patch is one of four patches that enhance the ePharmacy software to 
"BLD",7440,1,2,0)
provide the framework to support Tricare and Active Duty outpatient
"BLD",7440,1,3,0)
pharmacy billing.  The Tricare/Active Duty portions of this software
"BLD",7440,1,4,0)
enhancement will not be active until a future patch is released.  The
"BLD",7440,1,5,0)
release of the additional patch is pending Central Business Office (CBO)
"BLD",7440,1,6,0)
contracting with the Tricare Fiscal Intermediary.

All four patches are being released separately with a requirement that 
"BLD",7440,1,19,0)
they be installed in the order outlined above.  There are no other 
"BLD",7440,1,20,0)
dependencies between these patches, except that Tricare/Active Duty 
"BLD",7440,1,21,0)
billing will not be supported by ePharmacy until all 4 patches are 
"BLD",7440,1,22,0)
installed.
"BLD",7440,1,23,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,24,0)
All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they 
"BLD",7440,1,25,0)
have been activated for ePharmacy by the CBO or are providing outpatient
"BLD",7440,1,26,0)
pharmacy services to Tricare or Active Duty patients.  After the
"BLD",7440,1,27,0)
installation of these patches, the activation status of the site will not
"BLD",7440,1,28,0)
be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy product will require
"BLD",7440,1,29,0)
instructions provided by the CBO, and sites are not to activate ePharmacy
"BLD",7440,1,30,0)
unless instructed specifically by the CBO.  Also, sites should not start
"BLD",7440,1,31,0)
to provide outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare patients without
"BLD",7440,1,32,0)
discussions with the CBO.

"BLD",7440,1,34,0)
This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
"BLD",7440,1,35,0)
below.  The modifications labeled dormant in the software and will remain
"BLD",7440,1,36,0)
inactive until the future Tricare patch is released.
"BLD",7440,1,37,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,38,0)
1.  (Dormant) - Prescriptions where the patient is Tricare eligible will
"BLD",7440,1,39,0)
be submitted to ECME for third party insurance processing in the same
"BLD",7440,1,40,0)
manner as all other insurance types.  Tricare eligibility is determined by
"BLD",7440,1,41,0)
Integrated Billing (IB). An indicator is returned to Outpatient Pharmacy
"BLD",7440,1,42,0)
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and REFILL multiple (#52.1) to be stored in the
"BLD",7440,1,43,0)
new BILLING ELIGIBILITY INDICATOR field (#85).  Because this is a set of
"BLD",7440,1,44,0)
codes field, the internal value will be T, V or C. These values will be
"BLD",7440,1,45,0)
displayed respectively to the user as TRICARE, VETERAN, or CHAMPVA. Note
"BLD",7440,1,46,0)
that CHAMPVA will not be addressed in this patch.  Prescriptions with only
"BLD",7440,1,47,0)
a 'VETERAN' eligibility flag are what is currently processed through ECME.
"BLD",7440,1,48,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,49,0)
2.  (Dormant) - When a Tricare prescription has a third party rejection,
"BLD",7440,1,50,0)
the same reject notification screen will be displayed to the user as is
"BLD",7440,1,51,0)
currently done for the Veteran eligibility.  Tricare Rejections will be
"BLD",7440,1,52,0)
stored in the same manner as Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and
"BLD",7440,1,53,0)
Refill-too-soon (RTS) prescription reject are currently stored.
"BLD",7440,1,54,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,55,0)
The following exceptions will apply for Tricare prescriptions:
"BLD",7440,1,56,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,57,0)
    A.  All Tricare rejections will be denoted as Tricare in the REJECT 
"BLD",7440,1,58,0)
        Information header on the Reject Information screen.
"BLD",7440,1,59,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,60,0)
    B.  Where DUR or RTS are one of the reject codes, the user will be
"BLD",7440,1,61,0)
        able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription, submit 
"BLD",7440,1,62,0)
        (O)verride codes, or (Q)uit which sends the rejection to the Third
"BLD",7440,1,63,0)
        Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.  Tricare rejection may not be
"BLD",7440,1,64,0)
        (I)gnored.
"BLD",7440,1,65,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,66,0)
    C.  For prescription rejections that have non-DUR/RTS rejects, the
"BLD",7440,1,67,0)
        user will be able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription or
"BLD",7440,1,68,0)
        (Q)uit which sends it to the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.
"BLD",7440,1,69,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,70,0)
    D.  For non-billable Tricare prescriptions, an abbreviated version of
"BLD",7440,1,71,0)
        the reject notification screen will be displayed.  Because the
"BLD",7440,1,72,0)
        prescriptions is non-billable, the insurance and ECME information
"BLD",7440,1,73,0)
        that's currently provided for DUR/RTS rejects will not be
"BLD",7440,1,74,0)
        displayed (i.e. insurance, group name, group #, ECME #, contact,
"BLD",7440,1,75,0)
        cardholder ID).  In this case, the user will only be able to
"BLD",7440,1,76,0)
        (D)iscontinue the prescription due to the business rule that OP
"BLD",7440,1,77,0)
        cannot fill Tricare prescriptions that are non-billable.
"BLD",7440,1,78,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,79,0)
    E.  Labels will not print for discontinued Tricare prescriptions.
"BLD",7440,1,80,0)
        Reprint labels will not be allowed to be printed for Tricare
"BLD",7440,1,81,0)
        rejected prescriptions.  The reject notification screen will be
"BLD",7440,1,82,0)
        displayed during reprint in the same manner as non-Tricare
"BLD",7440,1,83,0)
        prescription currently are displayed with the exception of the
"BLD",7440,1,84,0)
        available actions listed above for Tricare prescriptions.
"BLD",7440,1,85,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,86,0)
    F.  Suspended prescriptions will remain on suspense when a reject
"BLD",7440,1,87,0)
        occurs, when the Rx is non-billable, or when the third party claim
"BLD",7440,1,88,0)
        remains in an 'IN PROGRESS' status in ECME.  Labels will not
"BLD",7440,1,89,0)
        print.  Once the reject is resolved, the user may pull the Rx 
"BLD",7440,1,90,0)
        early from suspense or wait for the next scheduled print from
"BLD",7440,1,91,0)
        suspense runs at which time labels will print accordingly. This
"BLD",7440,1,92,0)
        includes CMOP and local suspense.
"BLD",7440,1,93,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,94,0)
    G.  Rejected Tricare prescription may not have a partial fill ordered 
"BLD",7440,1,95,0)
        until the reject is resolved.
"BLD",7440,1,96,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,97,0)
    H.  When the  Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option is used, 
"BLD",7440,1,98,0)
        Tricare prescriptions will be processed in the foreground and
"BLD",7440,1,99,0)
        rejections will be displayed for user intervention.
"BLD",7440,1,100,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,101,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,102,0)
3.  (Dormant except for item C.) - The Third Party Payer Rejects -
"BLD",7440,1,103,0)
Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option and the Third Party Payer Rejects -
"BLD",7440,1,104,0)
View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options have been modified in the
"BLD",7440,1,105,0)
following manner:
"BLD",7440,1,106,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,107,0)
     A. Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejections will be segregated at the end of
"BLD",7440,1,108,0)
        the displayed information. They will be denoted with a "TRICARE -
"BLD",7440,1,109,0)
        Non-DUR/RTS" header.  This header will remain regardless of
"BLD",7440,1,110,0)
        whether the GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on or off.  
"BLD",7440,1,111,0)
        The Tricare section will sort in the same manner as the main sort
"BLD",7440,1,112,0)
        for non-Tricare prescriptions (i.e. by Rx, drug, patient, etc.).
"BLD",7440,1,113,0)
  
"BLD",7440,1,114,0)
     B. Tricare DUR/RTS rejects will be displayed with all other DUR/RTS
"BLD",7440,1,115,0)
        rejects.  When GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on, the
"BLD",7440,1,116,0)
        header "TRICARE" will be displayed, and this "TRICARE" section
"BLD",7440,1,117,0)
        will sort alphabetically within the other insurances.  This
"BLD",7440,1,118,0)
        Tricare section is separate from the Non-DUR/RTS section that
"BLD",7440,1,119,0)
        displays at the end of the listing.  When GI is toggled off, these
"BLD",7440,1,120,0)
        rejects will sorted in the same section as all other DUR/RTS
"BLD",7440,1,121,0)
        rejects.
"BLD",7440,1,122,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,123,0)
     C. (Not dormant) - The new TRI - Show/Hide Tricare toggle action has
"BLD",7440,1,124,0)
        been added to the hidden menu on the Insurance Rejects screen.  
"BLD",7440,1,125,0)
        When toggled to Show, Tricare Non-DUR/RTS reject will be
"BLD",7440,1,126,0)
        automatically displayed at the end of the listing.  Toggling the
"BLD",7440,1,127,0)
        TRI action to Hide will remove them from the screen.
"BLD",7440,1,128,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,129,0)
     D. The Reject Information screen has been modified to display TRICARE
"BLD",7440,1,130,0)
        in the header for the Reject Information section.  For DUR/RTS
"BLD",7440,1,131,0)
        Tricare rejects, the IGN - Ignore Reject action will be shown but
"BLD",7440,1,132,0)
        will not be selectable. For Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejects, the FIL -
"BLD",7440,1,133,0)
        Fill Rx action will be displayed. If the prescription is payable,
"BLD",7440,1,134,0)
        the user will be allowed to fill the prescription and print the
"BLD",7440,1,135,0)
        label.  If not payable, a message will be displayed stating that
"BLD",7440,1,136,0)
        the prescription must have a payable status to be filled.
"BLD",7440,1,137,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,138,0)
     E. For rejects that remain in suspense, the user will be allowed to
"BLD",7440,1,139,0)
        process the rejection as indicated above, however no labels will
"BLD",7440,1,140,0)
        be printed until the prescription is pulled early or printed from
"BLD",7440,1,141,0)
        suspense.  Upon resolving the reject, the user will be notified
"BLD",7440,1,142,0)
        of this information.  CMOP prescriptions will function in the same
"BLD",7440,1,143,0)
        manner.
"BLD",7440,1,144,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,145,0)
4.  In preparation for a future ePharmacy patch the following fields are 
"BLD",7440,1,146,0)
being added to PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for original fills and refills:
"BLD",7440,1,147,0)
DATE NDC VALIDATED field (#83) and NDC VALIDATED BY field (#84).  
"BLD",7440,1,148,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,149,0)
5.  For ePharmacy prescriptions, the price per dispense unit for the
"BLD",7440,1,150,0)
NDC will be saved in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  For original fills, the  
"BLD",7440,1,151,0)
UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#17) will be updated.  For refills, the CURRENT
"BLD",7440,1,152,0)
UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#1.2) of REFILL multiple (#52.1) will be
"BLD",7440,1,153,0)
updated. If the NDC chosen is the default NDC, the value stored will be
"BLD",7440,1,154,0)
taken from PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).  If the
"BLD",7440,1,155,0)
NDC selected is a synonym, the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#404) of
"BLD",7440,1,156,0)
SYNONYM multiple (#9) of DRUG file (#50) will be saved. In the case of
"BLD",7440,1,157,0)
CMOP fills, only the default NDC price will be stored which is taken from
"BLD",7440,1,158,0)
PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).
"BLD",7440,1,159,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,160,0)
6.  (Dormant) - If ECME's status on the claim remains in an "In Progress"
"BLD",7440,1,161,0)
state past the processing time out during finish of the prescription,
"BLD",7440,1,162,0)
Tricare prescriptions will not be allowed to be filled and must be
"BLD",7440,1,163,0)
discontinued.
"BLD",7440,1,164,0)
 
"BLD",7440,1,165,0)
7.  (Dormant) - If the pharmacy is active for ePharmacy processing but the
"BLD",7440,1,166,0)
insurance plan is not linked or not active, Tricare prescription will be
"BLD",7440,1,167,0)
allowed to be filled normally.  The phrase "Inactive ECME Tricare" will be
"BLD",7440,1,168,0)
displayed during Finish.

This patch is one of four patches that enhance the ePharmacy software to 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
provide the framework to support Tricare and Active Duty outpatient
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
pharmacy billing.  The Tricare/Active Duty portions of this software
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
enhancement will not be active until a future patch is released.  The
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
release of the additional patch is pending Central Business Office (CBO)
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
contracting with the Tricare Fiscal Intermediary.

All four patches are being released separately with a requirement that 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
they be installed in the order outlined above.  There are no other 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
dependencies between these patches, except that Tricare/Active Duty 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
billing will not be supported by ePharmacy until all 4 patches are 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
installed.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
have been activated for ePharmacy by the CBO or are providing outpatient
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
pharmacy services to Tricare or Active Duty patients.  After the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
installation of these patches, the activation status of the site will not
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy product will require
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
instructions provided by the CBO, and sites are not to activate ePharmacy
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
unless instructed specifically by the CBO.  Also, sites should not start
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
to provide outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare patients without
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
discussions with the CBO.

This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
below.  The modifications labeled dormant in the software and will remain
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
inactive until the future Tricare patch is released.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
1.  (Dormant) - Prescriptions where the patient is Tricare eligible will
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
be submitted to ECME for third party insurance processing in the same
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
manner as all other insurance types.  Tricare eligibility is determined by
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
Integrated Billing (IB). An indicator is returned to Outpatient Pharmacy
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and REFILL multiple (#52.1) to be stored in the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
new BILLING ELIGIBILITY INDICATOR field (#85).  Because this is a set of
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
codes field, the internal value will be T, V or C. These values will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
displayed respectively to the user as TRICARE, VETERAN, or CHAMPVA. Note
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
that CHAMPVA will not be addressed in this patch.  Prescriptions with only
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,47,0)
a 'VETERAN' eligibility flag are what is currently processed through ECME.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,48,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,49,0)
2.  (Dormant) - When a Tricare prescription has a third party rejection,
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)
the same reject notification screen will be displayed to the user as is
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,51,0)
currently done for the Veteran eligibility.  Tricare Rejections will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,52,0)
stored in the same manner as Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,53,0)
Refill-too-soon (RTS) prescription reject are currently stored.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,54,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,55,0)
The following exceptions will apply for Tricare prescriptions:
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,56,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,57,0)
    A.  All Tricare rejections will be denoted as Tricare in the REJECT 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,58,0)
        Information header on the Reject Information screen.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,59,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)
    B.  Where DUR or RTS are one of the reject codes, the user will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,61,0)
        able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription, submit 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,62,0)
        (O)verride codes, or (Q)uit which sends the rejection to the Third
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,63,0)
        Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.  Tricare rejection may not be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,64,0)
        (I)gnored.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,65,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,66,0)
    C.  For prescription rejections that have non-DUR/RTS rejects, the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,67,0)
        user will be able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription or
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,68,0)
        (Q)uit which sends it to the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,69,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,70,0)
    D.  For non-billable Tricare prescriptions, an abbreviated version of
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,71,0)
        the reject notification screen will be displayed.  Because the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,72,0)
        prescriptions is non-billable, the insurance and ECME information
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,73,0)
        that's currently provided for DUR/RTS rejects will not be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,74,0)
        displayed (i.e. insurance, group name, group #, ECME #, contact,
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,75,0)
        cardholder ID).  In this case, the user will only be able to
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,76,0)
        (D)iscontinue the prescription due to the business rule that OP
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,77,0)
        cannot fill Tricare prescriptions that are non-billable.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,78,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,79,0)
    E.  Labels will not print for discontinued Tricare prescriptions.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,80,0)
        Reprint labels will not be allowed to be printed for Tricare
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,81,0)
        rejected prescriptions.  The reject notification screen will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,82,0)
        displayed during reprint in the same manner as non-Tricare
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,83,0)
        prescription currently are displayed with the exception of the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,84,0)
        available actions listed above for Tricare prescriptions.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,85,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,86,0)
    F.  Suspended prescriptions will remain on suspense when a reject
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,87,0)
        occurs, when the Rx is non-billable, or when the third party claim
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,88,0)
        remains in an 'IN PROGRESS' status in ECME.  Labels will not
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,89,0)
        print.  Once the reject is resolved, the user may pull the Rx 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,90,0)
        early from suspense or wait for the next scheduled print from
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,91,0)
        suspense runs at which time labels will print accordingly. This
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,92,0)
        includes CMOP and local suspense.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,93,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,94,0)
    G.  Rejected Tricare prescription may not have a partial fill ordered

following manner:
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,106,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,107,0)
     A. Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejections will be segregated at the end of
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,108,0)
        the displayed information. They will be denoted with a "TRICARE -
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,109,0)
        Non-DUR/RTS" header.  This header will remain regardless of
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,110,0)
        whether the GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on or off.  
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,111,0)
        The Tricare section will sort in the same manner as the main sort
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,112,0)
        for non-Tricare prescriptions (i.e. by Rx, drug, patient, etc.).
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,113,0)
  
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,114,0)
     B. Tricare DUR/RTS rejects will be displayed with all other DUR/RTS
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,115,0)
        rejects.  When GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on, the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,116,0)
        header "TRICARE" will be displayed, and this "TRICARE" section
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,117,0)
        will sort alphabetically within the other insurances.  This
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,118,0)
        Tricare section is separate from the Non-DUR/RTS section that
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,119,0)
        displays at the end of the listing.  When GI is toggled off, these
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,120,0)
        rejects will sorted in the same section as all other DUR/RTS
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,121,0)
        rejects.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,122,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,123,0)
     C. (Not dormant) - The new TRI - Show/Hide Tricare toggle action has
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,124,0)
        been added to the hidden menu on the Insurance Rejects screen.  
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,125,0)
        When toggled to Show, Tricare Non-DUR/RTS reject will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,126,0)
        automatically displayed at the end of the listing.  Toggling the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,127,0)
        TRI action to Hide will remove them from the screen.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,128,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,129,0)
     D. The Reject Information screen has been modified to display TRICARE
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,130,0)
        in the header for the Reject Information section.  For DUR/RTS
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,131,0)
        Tricare rejects, the IGN - Ignore Reject action will be shown but
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,132,0)
        will not be selectable. For Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejects, the FIL -
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,133,0)
        Fill Rx action will be displayed. If the prescription is payable,
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,134,0)
        the user will be allowed to fill the prescription and print the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,135,0)
        label.  If not payable, a message will be displayed stating that
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,136,0)
        the prescription must have a payable status to be filled.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,137,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,138,0)
     E. For rejects that remain in suspense, the user will be allowed to
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,139,0)
        process the rejection as indicated above, however no labels will
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,140,0)
        be printed until the prescription is pulled early or printed from
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,141,0)
        suspense.  Upon resolving the reject, the user will be notified
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,142,0)
        of this information.  CMOP prescriptions will function in the same
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,143,0)
        manner.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,144,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,145,0)
4.  In preparation for a future ePharmacy patch the following fields are 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,146,0)
being added to PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for original fills and refills:
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,147,0)
DATE NDC VALIDATED field (#83) and NDC VALIDATED BY field (#84).  
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,148,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,149,0)
5.  For ePharmacy prescriptions, the price per dispense unit for the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,150,0)
NDC will be saved in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  For original fills, the  
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,151,0)
UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#17) will be updated.  For refills, the CURRENT
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,152,0)
UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#1.2) of REFILL multiple (#52.1) will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,153,0)
updated. If the NDC chosen is the default NDC, the value stored will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,154,0)
taken from PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).  If the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,155,0)
NDC selected is a synonym, the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#404) of
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,156,0)
SYNONYM multiple (#9) of DRUG file (#50) will be saved. In the case of
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,157,0)
CMOP fills, only the default NDC price will be stored which is taken from
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,158,0)
PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,159,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,160,0)
6.  (Dormant) - If ECME's status on the claim remains in an "In Progress"
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,161,0)
state past the processing time out during finish of the prescription,
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,162,0)
Tricare prescriptions will not be allowed to be filled and must be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,163,0)
discontinued.
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,164,0)
 
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,165,0)
7.  (Dormant) - If the pharmacy is active for ePharmacy processing but the
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,166,0)
insurance plan is not linked or not active, Tricare prescription will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,167,0)
allowed to be filled normally.  The phrase "Inactive ECME Tricare" will be
"PKG",206,22,1,"PAH",1,1,168,0)
displayed during Finish.
