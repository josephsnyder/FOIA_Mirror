 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1.  HD0000000127869 -  Activity Log does not show when a refill is
                        deleted.
  
     Problem:  
     -------- 
     When a non-suspended refill is deleted, there is no entry added into
     the Activity Log to reflect this.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------- 
     Need to modify routine PSOORED2, tag RFX, to create an Activity Log 
     entry in the Prescription file (#52).
  
 2.  HD0000000224285 - Outpatient Pharmacy error printing Medication
                       Instructions
  
     Problem:
     --------
     An undefined error occurs when selecting Print Medication Instructions
     after selecting Action Profile (OP) from the Other OP Actions in 
     Backdoor Pharmacy.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify the code so when printing Medication Instructions the RX0 variable
     is set.
  
 3.  HD0000000207738 -  <UNDEFINED>h+7^IBCSCU - Refer to PSO Tier 3
     
     Problem:
     --------
     An error occurs when billing is processing claims.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     When processing a bill for a claim for a prescription that expires the
     previous day an error occurs.  If the prescription should be expired, a
     call is made to update the prescription status to expired.  In this 
     process the VADM array is killed off so when returning to the billing
     process it is no longer defined and an error occurs.
  
 4.  HD0000000223077 - Med profile issue
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When changing a prescription from a co-pay to a non co-pay
     prescription, the $ still displays on the ePharmacy Medication Profile
     (View Only) screen.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify the routine PSOPMP1 to check the Co-pay Transaction Type and 
     only display the $ if it exists.
