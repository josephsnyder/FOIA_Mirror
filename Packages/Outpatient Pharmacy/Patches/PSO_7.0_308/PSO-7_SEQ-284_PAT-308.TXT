 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000237955 - Drug Text issue Error <UNDEFINED>PROVCOM+13^PSOORFI4
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 If a provider comment line entered in CPRS is longer than 32 characters 
 with no spaces, an error occurs in Outpatient Pharmacy when the 
 pharmacist is processing the pending order and answers "YES" to the 
 prompt:
  
 Copy Provider Comments into the Patient Instructions? No// YES
      MAX OF 32 CHARACTERS ALLOWED BETWEEN SPACES.
  
 <UNDEFINED>PROVCOM+13^PSOORFI4
  
 The provider comments are passed into the input transform code 
 SIGONE^PSOHELP, but fails because the input transform does not allow text 
 longer than 32 characters with no spaces.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modify routine PSOORFI4.  If the user answers "YES" to the prompt "Copy 
 Provider Comments into the Patient Instructions?", the Provider Comments 
 will be checked before being passed to the input transform.  If any line 
 is longer than 32 characters with no spaces, the following message is
 displayed:
  
 *** Provider Comments CANNOT be copied ***
 They contain a word longer than 32 characters, which is not allowed in
 the Patient Instructions.  You need to enter this manually.
 Press Return to continue:
  
 The user can then continue processing the order. 
  
      
 =================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  Users may be on the system.  
 However, since some options will be marked out of order, it is recommended
 that it be queued for off-peak hours.

    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select

       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*308)

          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
