Description:
============

 The FY10 Q2 Enhancement Release includes the following two enhancements.
  
 1. Canned Report for Outpatient Prescription Activity (NSR #20081114)
  
 A new option named Prescription List for Drug Warnings [PSO RX LIST]
 provides a report capable of identifying all prescriptions that have
 been finished with a particular medication(s) within a given date range.
 This report was developed by converting Class III functionality to a
 standardized, nationally released report.
  
 This new option has been placed under the Output Reports [PSO OUTPUTS]
 menu and uses a sort template PSO DRUG WARNINGS.
  
  
 Example of Input Prompts:
  
         **  To avoid undesired wrapping of the output data,   **
         **  please enter '0;256;999' at the 'DEVICE:' prompt. **

 The output of this report is in a delimited output format suitable for 
 export to MS Excel and includes data from original prescription fills,
 refills and partial fills. The report output is sorted primarily by
 patient name and secondarily by prescription number.
  
 Each fill of the prescription is printed on a separate line. Each 
 prescription detail line starts with a double backslash followed by an
 identifier to denote the type of fill (ORIGINAL, REFILL, PARTIAL). 
 Each line contains 38 fields separated by up-arrow ("^") as described 
 below:
  
    1. FILL TYPE (e.g.,\\ORIGINAL\)    2. RX #
    3. DRUG NAME                       4. PATIENT NAME

 MISCELLANEOUS FIX:
 ------------------
  
 The recently released patch PSO*7*326 provided the enhanced functionality
 to look up patient by prescription number in backdoor pharmacy. After
 installing this patch, four sites reported that they were unable to
 retrieve patient information by swiping the Veterans Identity Card (VIC),
 which had not been a problem before patch 326 installation. 
  
 The output of this particular card reader is in the format:
 "%99999999^XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^99999999^^^^N^9999999999?"
  
 The code change that was made to retrieve patient by prescription number 
 in patch 326 was not allowing the use of up-arrow ("^") characters as 
 part of the input data, hence the failure. This patch 348 addresses the 
 issue.
