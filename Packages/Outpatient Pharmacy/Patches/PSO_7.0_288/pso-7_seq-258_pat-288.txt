 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000210748     $ZE= <SUBSCRIPT>EN+7^PSOHCSUM  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 There are incomplete Non-VA Med records in the PHARMACY PATIENT 
 file (#55).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch adds one new menu option to the Maintenance menu [PSO 
 MAINTENANCE] option under Outpatient Pharmacy Manager menu [PSO 
 MANAGER].  The new option is, Pharmacy Patient Non-VA Meds 
 Report/Clean-up [PSOZ NON-VA MEDS REP/CLEAN].  The new menu option 
 contains two new options under it: Pharmacy Patient Erroneous Non-VA Meds 
 Report [PSO NON-VA MEDS REPORT] and Clean up Pharmacy Patient Non-VA Meds
 data [PSO NON-VA MEDS CLEAN-UP].
  
  
  
 When running option Pharmacy Patient Erroneous Non-VA Meds Report a 
 report will be sent to the user listing the patients and the erroneous
 Non-VA Meds entries and sorted by Division.  This report can be run 
 multiple times but should be run off hours.  Each time it is run it will
 only contain those entries that still need to be fixed.  The report data 
 will be stored in the ^XTMP("PSOP288") global and will be purged 90 days 
 after the create date.  After this date the user will need to re-run the 
 report to re-create the data that still needs to be cleaned up.

 NO ERRONEOUS ENTRIES FOUND
  
 Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// 
  
  
 To clean up the entries listed in the report, the user can run menu option
 Clean up Pharmacy Patient Non-VA Meds data.  This will prompt the user 
 for patient.  If the patient was not one identified on the report, the 
 user will receive '??' and be returned to the Patient prompt.  When a 
 valid patient is selected, the user is prompted for the Non-VA Meds fields 
 from the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) using a Fileman call to prompt for 
 each field.
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 The following Outpatient Pharmacy manuals were updated to reflect the 
 addition of a new option Pharmacy Patient Non-VA Meds Report/Clean-up 
 [PSOZ NON-VA MEDS REP/CLEAN].  This option is used to run a report of 
 erroneous Non-VA Meds entries in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) and 
 clean up these entries.
  
   
 The revised Outpatient Pharmacy manuals are available on the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories at one of the following Offices of
 Information (OI) Field Offices. These files need to be retrieved in binary
 format.
    
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
   
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the 
     first available FTP server.
    
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
    
       Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
       Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
       Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
    
     The documentation distribution includes:
