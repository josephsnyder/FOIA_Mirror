Description:

 PSO*7*328 is an informational patch that provides instructions for

 This revised version should be installed prior to patch OR*3*290 at

 Overview:
 =========
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A VA Medical Center reported that an unexpected narcotic order had 
    replaced an audiology consult order. When the situation was examined
    it was discovered that the audiology consult had been overwritten by
    the controlled drug order, which was a renewal order generated by the
    AudioCare AudioRENEWAL function.
  
    The AudioCARE AudioRENEWAL Module was de-activated by all 43 locations
    on Jan.16, 2009 to prevent the problem from occurring.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A new Class I interface has been written that allows the AudioCARE 
    renewal process to obtain the assigned order number the same way that
    Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS) does. Patch OR*3*290
    installs the new Class I interface. Modifications to the renewal code
    in the Class III routine VEXRX were necessary to implement the new
    interface. The refill code of the VEXRX routine was not affected.
  
    PSO*7*328 is an informational patch that provides instructions for 
    obtaining and installing the updated version of the Class III AudioCare
    routine VEXRX. This revised version of VEXRX should be installed prior
    to patch OR*3*290 at all Sites using AudioCARE applications.
