Subject: ePharmacy Enhancements - Tricare Active

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.
  
 This patch is being released along with PSS*1*139 and IB*2*405.  These
 patches can be installed in any order but the full functionality 
 for Nutritional Supplement additions contained within these patches will
 not be available until all 3 patches are installed.
  
 Tricare functionality described in this document will become active when 
 IB*2*405 patch is installed and a Tricare Payer Sheet is subsequently 
 defined for the site.  For sites that do not bill Tricare, the software 
 will remain dormant.  For sites who bill Tricare prescriptions, the 
 ePharmacy Implementation Team will notify them when they should activate 
 ePharmacy Tricare billing.
  
 This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
 below:
     
 1.  Modifications to change the default answer of (I)gnore on the Reject 
 Processing Screen to (Q)uit which automatically sends the claim rejection 
 information to the Pharmacy Reject Worklist for new orders, copies, edits 
 that create new orders, and renewal functions.
  
  
 2.  Additional software to handle the new "N" for Nutritional Supplement
 DEA special handling code added in patch PSS*1*139.  This new "N" code
 will be treated the same as supply items and investigational drugs in
 Outpatient Pharmacy.  Copay will not be charged, and third party billing 
 for these type drugs will only occur when the drug is also marked with 
 "E" for Electronically Billable.  When the drug is not defined to be 
 electronically billable, the ECME Log will reflect drug not billable.  
 For prescriptions where the eligibility changed since the last refill, a 
 "PRESCRIPTION QUESTIONS REVIEW NEEDED" MailMan message is sent.  The last 
 paragraph of this message will be changed to include nutritional drugs:
  
      Supply, nutritional and investigational drugs are not charged a VA
      copay but could be reimbursable by third party insurance.
  
 3.  For the ePharmacy Medication Profile (VIEW ONLY) [PSO PMP] option,
 flagged pending orders will be notated on the medication profile screen by
 highlighting the sequence number shown on the left side of the screen.  
 Note that the "Flagged by..." information shown once the prescription is
 selected is already present with the PSO*7*225 release.
  
 4.  For Tricare Reversal/Resubmit actions sent to ECME with NDC changes,
 the text for the ECME activity log was too large to fit in the field
 without being truncated.  The log entry text "Reversal/Re-submit sent"
 has been abbreviated to "Rev/Resubmit" to ensure the entire NDC is
 viewable in the log entry.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
   
   1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 download.vista.med.va.gov, 
      which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
   
   2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
 specific
      server as follows: 
    
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
   
  The documentation distribution includes:

  It is recommended that this patch be installed while no Outpatient 
  Pharmacy users are on the system.  The installation time should be less
  than 2 minutes.

         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
