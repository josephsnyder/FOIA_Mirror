This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
"BLD",7710,1,2,0)
Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
"BLD",7710,1,3,0)
pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.
"BLD",7710,1,4,0)
 
"BLD",7710,1,5,0)
All sites should install this patches regardless of whether or not they 
"BLD",7710,1,6,0)
have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO).  
"BLD",7710,1,7,0)
After the installation of these patches, the activation status of the 
"BLD",7710,1,8,0)
site will not be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy 
"BLD",7710,1,9,0)
product will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not to 
"BLD",7710,1,10,0)
activate unless instructed specifically by the CBO.
"BLD",7710,1,11,0)
 
"BLD",7710,1,12,0)
This patch is being released along with PSS*1*139 and IB*2*405.  These
"BLD",7710,1,13,0)
patches can be installed in any order but the full functionality 
"BLD",7710,1,14,0)
for Nutritional Supplement additions contained within these patches will
"BLD",7710,1,15,0)
not be available until all 3 patches are installed.
"BLD",7710,1,16,0)
 
"BLD",7710,1,17,0)
This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
"BLD",7710,1,18,0)
below:
"BLD",7710,1,19,0)
    
"BLD",7710,1,20,0)
1.  Modifications to change the default answer of (I)gnore on the Reject 
"BLD",7710,1,21,0)
Processing Screen to (Q)uit which automatically sends the claim rejection 
"BLD",7710,1,22,0)
information to the Pharmacy Reject Worklist for new orders, copies, edits 
"BLD",7710,1,23,0)
that create new orders, and renewal functions.  This patch, PSO*7*303,  
"BLD",7710,1,24,0)
includes the modifications for these functions.
"BLD",7710,1,25,0)
 
"BLD",7710,1,26,0)
2.  Additional software to handle the new "N  for Nutritional Supplement
"BLD",7710,1,27,0)
DEA special handling code added in patch PSS*1*139.  This new "N" code
"BLD",7710,1,28,0)
will be treated the same as supply items and investigational drugs in
"BLD",7710,1,29,0)
Outpatient Pharmacy.  Copay will not be charged, and third party billing 
"BLD",7710,1,30,0)
for these type drugs will only occur when the drug is also marked with 
"BLD",7710,1,31,0)
"E" for Electronically Billable.  When the drug is not defined to be 
"BLD",7710,1,32,0)
electronically billable, the ECME Log will reflect drug not billable.  
"BLD",7710,1,33,0)
For prescriptions where the eligibility changed since the last refill, a 
"BLD",7710,1,34,0)
"PRESCRIPTION QUESTIONS REVIEW NEEDED" MailMan message is sent.  The last 
"BLD",7710,1,35,0)
paragraph of this message will be changed to include nutritional drugs:
"BLD",7710,1,36,0)
 
"BLD",7710,1,37,0)
     Supply, nutritional and investigational drugs are not charged a VA
"BLD",7710,1,38,0)
     copay but could be reimbursable by third party insurance.
"BLD",7710,1,39,0)
 
"BLD",7710,1,40,0)
3.  For the ePharmacy Medication Profile (VIEW ONLY) [PSO PMP] option,
"BLD",7710,1,41,0)
flagged pending orders will be notated on the medication profile screen by
"BLD",7710,1,42,0)
highlighting the sequence number shown on the left side of the screen.  
"BLD",7710,1,43,0)
Note that the "Flagged by..." information shown once the prescription is
"BLD",7710,1,44,0)
selected is already present with the PSO*7*225 release.
"BLD",7710,1,45,0)
 
"BLD",7710,1,46,0)
4.  For Tricare Reversal/Resubmit actions sent to ECME with NDC changes,
"BLD",7710,1,47,0)
the text for the ECME activity log was too large to fit in the field
"BLD",7710,1,48,0)
without being truncated.  The log entry text "Reversal/Re-submit sent"
"BLD",7710,1,49,0)
has been abbreviated to "Rev/Resubmit" to ensure the entire NDC is 
"BLD",7710,1,50,0)
viewable in the log entry.
