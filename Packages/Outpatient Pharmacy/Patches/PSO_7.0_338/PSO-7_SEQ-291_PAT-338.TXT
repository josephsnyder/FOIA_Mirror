Subject: FY10 Q1 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The FY10 Q1 Enhancement Release includes the following.
  
 1. PSPO #1167
    The following enhancements were made for the Flagged Pending Orders.
    a. When using the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option,
       the message "<There are ## flagged orders for INSTITUTION>" is
       displayed in reverse video to alert the user that there are
       flagged pending orders.
  
    b. At the prompt, "Select By:  (PA/RT/PR/CL/FL/E): PATIENT//", the help
       text "FL FLAG" was changed to "FL FLAGGED".
  
 2. PSPO #1101 - Remedy Ticket #275487
    The following enhancements were made to the prescription laser label.
    a. The current title "Additional Warning Labels" that is printed at
       the top of the Patient Medication Information (PMI) section was
       renamed to "Additional Warnings".
  
    b. If the warning label is lengthy, requiring more than the four 
       provided lines, the label is truncated so the text "... See printed 
       Additional Warnings." can replace the fourth line.
  
    c. The truncated warning label and its code are printed in their 
       entirety at the top of the PMI section under the "Additional
       Warnings" section.
  
  
 3. Remedy Ticket #345084
    The warning message "<There are ## flagged orders for INSTITUTION>" is not
    displayed when there is only one associated CPRS ordering institution 
    with an outpatient site. Routine PSOORFI2 was corrected to fix this 
    problem.
