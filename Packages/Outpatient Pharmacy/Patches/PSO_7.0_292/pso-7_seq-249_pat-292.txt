Subject: RENEWED STATUS IN CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 PROBLEM:
 --------
 HD214867 - Renewed orders remaining active
  
  
 PSI-06-177 - RENEWED ORDERS REMAINING ACTIVE
 (Note: Other scenarios related to renewed orders are being corrected in
 patch PSO*7*257).
  
 1. If expiring or discontinuing a prescription that also has a pending
 renewal, the "renewed from" CPRS order's status is changed to expired or
 discontinued instead of staying as "renewed".
  
 2. If you cancel a pending renewal for a previously expired (or 
 discontinued) prescription that has been renewed after it expired, the 
 "renewed from" CPRS order should go back to "expired" (or "discontinued")
 instead of remaining as "renewed".
  
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 1. PSOHLSN1 - If  expiring or discontinuing a prescription that also has a
 pending renewal, keep the "renewed from" CPRS order's status as "renewed".
  
 2. PSOHLSN: - If you cancel a pending renewal for a previously expired (or
 discontinued) prescription that has been renewed after it expired (or 
 discontinued), set CPRS order's status back to expired (or discontinued).
