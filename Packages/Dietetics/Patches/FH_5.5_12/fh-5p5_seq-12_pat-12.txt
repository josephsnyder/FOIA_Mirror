============

 This patch will resolve the following 3 issues.

 [FHSELA] the user has the ability to modify the Food Preference name 
 and alter the LIKE/DISLIKE field.        
  
 #2 Nutrition and Food Service patch FH*5.5*8 created a new Clinician

 When utilizing menu option Create/Map Food Preferences to Allergies 
 [FHSELA],  the user has the ability to modify the Food Preference name 
 before it is filed.  The user can also change the LIKE/DISLIKE field from 
 the default DISLIKE to LIKE.

 edit the Food Preference name and the LIKE/DISLIKE field will no longer 
 be available for edit.
         
 Problem #2  HD0000000210883  POST FH*5.5*8 RELEASE ISSUES
 -------
 Patch FH*5.5*8 created a new multiple field, CLINICIAN(S) (#112), in the
 NUTRITION LOCATION file (#119.6) which allows for multiple clinicians to
 be defined for a location.  The following menu options allow the user
 update and display access to the old clinician field:
      
 DIETETIC FACILITIES
 WE  Enter/Edit Nutrition Locations [FHPRO2]
           
 DIETETICS MANAGEMENT/CM-CLINICAL MANAGEMENT/ XM-CONSULT MANAGEMENT
 WE  Enter/Edit Ward Assignments [FHORC5]

 Resolution #2

 Modifications will be made in routines FHPRO and FHSELA1 to eliminate 
 access to the old clinician field (#1) and print template - FHORWRD
 will be modified to no longer print/display the old clinician field.

 -------                      FIELD
 Menu option WL  List Nutrition Locations [FHPRO6] currently displays 
 the contents of the old clinician field from the NUTRITION LOCATION 
 file (#119.6).  This should  display the contents of the new Clinician's 
 Multiple field (#112).
      
 Resolution #3
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to routine FHPRW to now utilize the new 
 Clinician's multiple field (#112) when displaying the Nutrition Location
