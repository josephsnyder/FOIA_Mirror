Subject:  FOOD ALLERGY UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When mapping food preferences to food allergies, recent additions to 
 the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) are not being presented for mapping.
 This patch will add 10 new food/drug allergies to the hard coded list 
 in routine FHSELA2 so that they can be mapped in the N&FS menu option
 Create/Map Food Preference to Allergies [FHSELA].

   Patient Safety Issue:
   ---------------------
   PSPO 1380
  
   Problem:
   --------  
   The Create/Map Food Preferences to Allergies [FHSELA] option displays
   a list of all available food allergies that have not been previously
   mapped.  The available list of food allergies can be displayed using 
   the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) but the list of food allergies
   displayed in the Create/Map Food Preference to Allergies [FHSELA] is
   presented using the hard coded list contained within routine FHSELA2.  
   The ten new food allergies listed below were previously added to the GMR
   ALLERGIES file (#120.82) but the hard coded list was not updated with
   the same food allergies.  Therefore, an incomplete list of food
   allergies is presented to the user.  
  
   The following food allergies were previously added to the GMR ALLERGIES
   file (#120.82) using the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) push:
  
   - Agave
   - Canola Oil
   - Erythritol
   - Hemp Milk
   - Kale  
   - Margarine
   - Raw Onions
   - Raw Vegetables
   - Taro Root
   - Turmeric
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine FHSELA2 will be modified to display the ten new food allergies
   that were added to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) so that the user 
   can select the food allergies for mapping. To complete this process upon
   installation, sites must manually "map" the food allergy to the Food
   Preference file in the N&FS package.
  
   TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
   ==================
   The option Create/Map Food Preferences to Allergies [FHSELA] calls 
   routines FHSELA1 and FHSELA2 to map the allergies. FHSELA2 creates a 
   worklist of all food allergies.  FHSELA1 takes that work list and
   removes foods that have been previously mapped to allergies and presents
   the unmapped allergies to the user.  FHSELA1 handles the user's input
   and performs the mapping of the food preference to allergy.
  
   Routine FHSELA2 does not read the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) and
   dynamically create a work list of all food allergies. It uses the hard
   coded allergies listed in the routine FHSELA2. 
   
   The additions to the new GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) are not carried
   over in the work list routine.
