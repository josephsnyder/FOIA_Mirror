 REMEDY OVERVIEW: 
 ================
 1.  HD0000000204950 - Option FHDCRP to print Diet Cards   
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 When option FHDCRP, Print Diet Cards, is rerun to print diet cards for 
 new or updated meals, all diet cards for outpatient are being reprinted
 when they should not.
  
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 Modify routine FHDCR1A to additional screening to prevent the diet cards 
 for outpatient meals from reprinting.
  
 2.  HD0000000227233 - $ZE= <UNDEFINED>P3+4^FHORE21
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 Running option List Early/Late Trays [FHOREL1] for outpatients 
 encounters an undefined variable error and crashes the routine FHORE21. In
 routine FHORE21 the variable IS is conditionally set. If the conditions
 are not meet, the variable IS would remain undefined and the routine
 tries to use the undefine variable.  
  
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 Modification of routine FHORE21 to set the variable IS unconditionally to 
 a null value before the conditional logic to change its value. This way 
 when the routine FHORE21 is ready to use the variable IS it has been 
 defined.
  
 3.  HD0000000236902 - UNDEFINED ERROR FHOMCBRP
  
 PROBLEM 1:
 ----------
 When running option Combined Outpatient Meals Report [FHOMCBRP], the user 
 is asked to select from the following options: Location, Comm Office, 
 Production Facility, or All. When entering P for Production Facility the 
 user is then prompted to select a Production Facility. Entering a '^' at 
 this prompt will cause the option to error out with an Undefined error. 
 When entering a '^' the variable FHSLPRO is not set causing the undefined 
 error.
  
 RESOLUTION 1:
 -------------
 Modification of routine FHOMCBRP called by option FHOMCBRP to set the 
 variable FHSLPRO to a null value when the user enters a '^' at the prompt 
 to select a production facility.
  
 Problem 2: 
 ----------
 When running option Combined Outpatient Meals Report [FHOMCBRP], the user 
 is asked to select from the following options: Location, Comm Office, 
 Production Facility, or All. When entering C for Comm Office the user is 
 then prompted to select a Communication Office. Entering a '^' at this 
 prompt will cause the option to error out with an Undefined error.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 Modification of routine FHOMCBRP called by option FHOMCBRP to set the 
 variable FHSLCOM to a null value when the user enters a '^' at the prompt 
 to select a communication office.
