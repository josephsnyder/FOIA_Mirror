Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1.  When a nutritional assessment is completed and sent to CPRS progress
 notes, the laboratory test results indicator of "L", "L*", "H" and "H*"

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1.  HD0000000213478, HD0000000213076(d), HD0000000216413(d)
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 When a nutritional assessment is completed and sent to progress notes the 
 laboratory test result(s) indicators of "L", "L*", "H", and "H*" are lost 
 in the progress note.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of the formatting of the progress note to not overwrite the 
 laboratory result indicators.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000215699, HD0000000217901(d)
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 Sometimes the default height in the nutritional assessment will appear as 
 a future date in the internal VA FileMan format.
  
 This happens when:
 1. A patient has not had a previous nutritional assessment done.
 2. A patient has had a previous nutritional assessment done, but no 
    height was recorded.
 3. A patient has not had a height recorded in the 
    Vital Signs package.
 4. A diet order was placed for the patient which has an expiration date 
    for it. Such as a diet order placed followed by an NPO order.
  
 When entering a nutritional assessment the user is presented with the 
 current diet order for the patient. A work variable is set to the diet's 
 expiration if it has one. This same work variable is used to set the 
 default height of the patient. This work variable is not re-set after 
 getting the current diet and the routine use this for the default height.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of the routine to re-set the work variable after the user is 
 presented with the current diet.
  
 3.  HD0000000216692, HD0000000230671(d)
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 When editing a "Work In Progress" nutritional assessment, the protein 
 level entered by the user is ignored when calculating the protein 
 requirements based on the patient's age. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of the routine to use the user entered protein level if it 
 does not equal the protein level based on the patient's age.
  
 4.  HD0000000222243, HD0000000223763(d), HD0000000229858(d)
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 The nutritional assessment saved to Progress Notes shows a time of 00:00 
 in the Date/Time Created. The API used to create the time has a timestamp 
 input variable that was being set to the current date only and not the 
 current date and time.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of the timestamp variable for the API used to create the 
 progress note to be set to the current date and time.
  
 5.  HD0000000225833
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 When editing a "Work In Progress" nutritional assessment, it will 
 overwrite the "Date Weight Last Taken" with a null.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of the routine to protect the value of the "Date Weight Last 
 Taken" during the editing of a "Work In Progress" nutritional assessment.
  
 6.  HD0000000230708, HD0000000215026(d), HD0000000224294(d)
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 The outpatient nutrition assessments are creating notes in TIU. According 
 to the documentation in both the patch and the Nutrition and Food Service 
 User Manual, the notes are to be created for inpatients only. The routine
 FHASM7 performs a check to make sure that TIU are done only for patient's 
 with an record in the PATIENT file(#2).  It does not perform the
 extra check needed to make the patient is an inpatient.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of routine FHASM7 to perform the additional check to make 
 sure the patient the assessment is done for is an inpatient. If the 
 assessment is entered for an outpatient the save to TIU is skipped.
