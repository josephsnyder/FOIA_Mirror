Subject: ADD NEW FOOD ALLERGIES TO FHSELA2 & ADDRESS UNDEFINED ERROR IN FHOMGP1

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issues:
  
 1. It will add new food allergies RAW APPLES and RAW CHERRIES to the 
 mapping capability for food preference dislikes (aka the Create/Map Food
 Preferences to Allergies [FHSELA] option).
  
 2. It will correct an <UNDEFINED> variable error in routine FHOMPG1 when 
 the user up arrows out of selecting either a Communication Office or 
 Production Facility.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------
 1. INC6742271 - FH Patch needed for RAW APPLES and RAW CHERRIES: FOOD 
    allergy type
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added RAW 
 APPLES and RAW CHERRIES as FOOD allergy types to the GMR ALLERGIES file
 (#120.82). These new FOOD allergies must be added to the routine FHSELA2
 to be mapped as allergy type food preference dislikes in the Dietetics
 package.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard-coded list of food allergies. It presents this 
 hard-coded list to the user when adding a food allergy preference dislike
 to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then maps it to a matching
 record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). The new allergies have been
 added to the hard-coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so that
 they may be presented to the user. To keep with the naming convention in
 the option, RAW APPLES and RAW CHERRIES will be presented to the user as
 APPLES, RAW and CHERRIES, RAW.
  
 2. INC7176688 - Post Linux Migration Error: <UNDEFINED>EN+9^FHOMGP1
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When running the Print Guest Meal List [FHOMGP] option and the user up
 arrows out at either the Select Communication Office or the Select
 Production Facility prompts, a hard M error occurs. An <UNDEFINED> M
 error is generated and the user's session is terminated.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine FHOMGP1 uses variables to store the IENs of the selected 
 Communication Office or Production Facility the user wishes to run 
 the Guest Meals List report for. If the record lookup is unsuccessful,
 these variables are set to null and the report exits. When the user enters
 an up arrow to exit from either prompt, these variables do not get set,
 causing the undefined error. To correct this, routine FHOMGP1 has been
 modified to set these variables to null before the user is prompted for
 either the Communication Office or the Production Facility. When a user
 enters an up arrow or has a failed record lookup, the option will function
 without error.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 -----------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select Backup a Transport Global and when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch FH*5.5*52. This option
    will create a backup message of any routines exported with this patch.
    It will not backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. If for
    any reason the patch is to be rolled back, this backup will be required
    to restore the patch's routine(s) to the pre-installation version(s).
  
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch: FH*5.5*52 
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
