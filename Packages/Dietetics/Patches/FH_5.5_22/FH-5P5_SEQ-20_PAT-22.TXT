 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. HD0000000343683 - <DIVIDE>SDAT+8^FHASM7 error
   
   Problem:
   --------
   When a user enters an "^" at the "Height:" prompt of the Enter/Edit 
   Assessment [FHASM1] option, a question is presented to the 
   user: "Do you wish to SAVE this Assessment Y//".  If the user accepts 
   the default of "Y", an error will occur.  A division by zero error
   occurs in routine FHASM1 because the application fails to properly 
   evaluate the "^" and presents the user with the "Do you wish to SAVE
   this Assessment" prompt. The "Height:" prompt is the first prompt
   in the Enter/Edit Assessment option and at this point there is
   no data for the assessment.  By accepting the default of "Yes",
   routine FHASM7 is called to calculate the patient's Body Mass Index 
   (BMI) but has no data in the Height field to use in the calculation, 
   therefore, generating an error. 
   Entering an "^" at any input prompt should exit the user out of the 
   current option and return them to the calling menu option. 
  
   
   Resolution:
   ------------
   A modification will be made to routine FHASM1 to properly test the
   user's input of "^" and exit the user from the Enter/Edit 
   Assessment option [FHASM1].
