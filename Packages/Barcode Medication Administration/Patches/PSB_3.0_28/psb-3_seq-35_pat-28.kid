This patch is a component of the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
Version 3.0 Managing Scanning Failures (MSF) project.  The main function
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
of PSB*3*28 and the corresponding BCMA GUI software (BCMA Version 3 Patch
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
28 [3.0.28]) is to document scanning failures during BCMA patient and
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
medication verification. Please see Release Notes document for more 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
details on the following enhancements.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
1. Enhancement:  Document Unable to Scan events. This patch will enable
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
   the user to document Unable to Scan events that occur during BCMA
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
   patient and medication verification.  The Computerized Patient Record
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
   System Medical Order Button and the creation of ward stock orders in
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
   BCMA will not be fully supported by the Unable to Scan functionality.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
2. Enhancement:  Send a MailMan message for each Unable to Scan event.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
   When a user documents an Unable to Scan event, a message will
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
   be sent to persons who are members of the mail group established
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
   via the BCMA Site Parameter's Unable to Scan mail group field
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
   setting. This message will also be sent to the user submitting
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
   the Unable to Scan event documentation.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
3. Enhancement:  Add two new Unable to Scan Reports.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
   Detailed and summary reports of BCMA Unable to Scan data may be
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
   executed by persons holding the PSB UNABLE TO SCAN security key.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
4. Enhancement: Added Division Filtering to Unable to Scan Reports.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
   The user's division is detected upon login, and used to filter
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
   Entire Facility and Nurse Unit options on the Summary Report, and All
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
   Patients/Wards option on the Detailed Report.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
5. Enhancement: Added new PSB*3*32 functionality to the MSF reports.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
   Patch PSB*3*32 created new report functionality requirements, such as
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
   allowing a start and stop time, and report preview. For consistency,
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
   these have been included in the MSF reports.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
6. Enhancement: Usability.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
   Made changes based on feedback from the MSF usability study.
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
 
"PKG",536,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
