Description:
============

  
 ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately
 after the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
  
                    WARNING FOR ALL SITES CURRENTLY USING WMA
                      (Wireless Medication Administration)
                                From CareFusion
  
 Installation of BCMA Patch PSB*3.0*28 may cause your WMA application to stop
 functioning as you would expect it to. In order for the WMA devices to work
 properly with PSB*3.0*28 installed, you must contact CareFusion, the WMA
 vendor, to obtain the most current version of the WMA software.
  
 Please test this patch thoroughly in your TEST environment before installing
 into PRODUCTION. If you encounter any issues with the WMA application,
 please report them to CareFusion.
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
 This patch is a component of the Bar Code Medication Administration
 (BCMA) V. 3.0 Managing Scanning Failures (MSF) project.  The main
 function of PSB*3*28 and the corresponding BCMA GUI software is to
 document scanning failures during BCMA patient and medication verification.
  
 Please see the Release Notes for more details on the following enhancements.
  
 1. Enhancement:  Document Unable to Scan events. This patch will enable
    the user to document Unable to Scan events that occur during BCMA
    patient and medication verification.  The Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS) Medication Order Button does not support Unable to Scan
    functionality. Administration of Ward Stock IV orders is partially 
    supported by Unable to Scan functionality. Users can select Unable to
    Scan - Create WS, enter a reason for the scanning failure and optional
    comment, then proceed with the normal ward stock work flow.
  
 2. Enhancement:  Send a MailMan message for each Unable to Scan event.
    When a user documents an Unable to Scan event, a message will
    be sent to persons who are members of the mail group established
    via the BCMA Site Parameter's Unable to Scan mail group field
    setting. This message will also be sent to the user submitting
    the Unable to Scan event documentation.
  
 3. Enhancement:  Add two new Unable to Scan Reports.
    The Unable to Scan Detailed and Summary reports provide BCMA wristband
    and Medication scanning failure data. These reports can only be executed 
    by persons holding the PSB UNABLE TO SCAN security key. Users can  
    specify a variety of selection criteria at report run time. These 
    new reports are only available through the BCMA GUI.
  
 4. Enhancement: Added report enhancements to the MSF Unable to Scan reports 
    to be consistent with other BCMA reports. Features include: 
    Added user specified report criteria on report headers; added preview, 
    print (directly to printer), and queuing functionality; added print by 
    Ward functionality; added check boxes on report dialogs to filter 
    ward drop-down list.
  
 5. Enhancement: Added Division Filtering to Unable to Scan Reports.
    The user's division is detected upon login, and used to filter
    Entire Facility and Nurse Unit options on the Summary Report, and All
    Patients/Wards option on the Detailed Report.
  
 6. Enhancement: Replaced Take Action on WS with Take Action on Bag.
    Added Take Action on Bag option to the IV Bag Chronology Window to
    allow user to take action on Infusing or Stopped bags without having
    to rescan the IV bag or enter a duplicate Unable to Scan event. 
    This new option applies to both pharmacy IV bags and Ward Stock IV bags.
  
 7. Enhancement: Added a new mode called "Limited Access BCMA" that 
    provides medication administering users the ability to access BCMA 
    without being at the patient's bedside. It allows access to patient 
    records for non-medication administration documentation, review, 
    and reporting purposes, without having to scan patient wristbands 
    or register erroneous Unable to Scan events.
