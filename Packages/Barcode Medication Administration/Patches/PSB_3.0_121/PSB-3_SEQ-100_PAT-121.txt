Subject: RX ONE-TIME W/PRN ORDERS NOT REVERT TO ACTIVE WHEN UNDO IN BCMA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
  
 1. INC6279084 - Rx ONE-TIME PRN orders not revert to active when undo on
                 BCMA
   
 Defect Tracking System Ticket & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC6279084 - Rx ONE-TIME PRN orders not revert to active when undo on 
                 BCMA
                 
 Problem: 
 --------
 When a ONE-TIME with PRN order is administered in BCMA and then later
 reversed through the EDIT MED LOG option with a status of undo-given the
 order does not become active, but instead, remains discontinued/expired.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify code to allow an Rx ONE-TIME with PRN order to be reverted from 
 recently discontinued/expired status back to active status in BCMA when 
 the EDIT MED LOG option is used to change the status to undo-given.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routine PSBLM2 adding code at UPDATED+148 that will revert an Rx 
 order from discontinued status back to active status when that order has 
 an ORDER STATUS of "PRN".

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 It is not necessary to disable any options.  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes to 
 install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSB*3.0*121).
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not backup any
       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
    
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
   
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//" respond NO.  
   
 6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
   
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
  ;;3.0; BAR CODE MED ADMIN;**[Patch List]**; Mar 2004
   
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 To verify that the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
