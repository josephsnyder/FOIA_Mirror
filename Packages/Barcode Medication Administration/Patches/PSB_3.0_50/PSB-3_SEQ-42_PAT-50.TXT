Description:
============

 This patch addresses Patient Safety issue PSPO #1401 and 
 three additional issues in Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA):
 
 1. PSPO #1401 - When a pain score is entered through BCMA and then marked 
    "entered in error" in Vitals, the errant pain score still shows on the 
    BCMA Coversheet and other reports.
 2. Receiving an error "Error - <UNDEFINED>SCANFAIL+9^PSBMLEN1" when 
    running the MANUAL MEDICATION ENTRY [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option.
 3. Receiving error "<SUBSCRIPT>EN+12^PSBOMH1" when running the Medication 
    Administration History (MAH) report when the nurse has given a 
    medication and does not have his/her initials in the NEW PERSON 
    file (#200).
 4. The Medication Therapy report does not contain PRN Effectiveness 
    information.

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 =============================
 
  1. HD0000000322046  PSPO #1401 - Vitals signs entered in error and 
     corrected are not corrected on the BCMA Cover Sheet and other 
     reports when related to a PRN order.
                     
  Problem:
  --------
  When a pain score is entered through BCMA and then marked "entered
  in error" in Vitals, the errant pain score still shows on the BCMA 
  Coversheet, BCMA Med Log and CPRS Med Log.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  This patch will correct PSPO #1401.
  Routine PSBCSUTL was modified to check if a Pain Score was entered through
  BCMA and then marked "Entered in Error." If this is the case, an additional
  comment will be added to log saying "*Pain Score of _ entered in Vitals via
  BCMA at _ may have been marked 'Entered in Error'. See Vitals Package for
  an updated score."  Also, when a PRN Effectiveness is marked "Entered
  in Error" the comment "**Pain Score of _ entered in Vitals via BCMA at _ may
  have been marked 'Entered in Error'. See Vitals Package for an updated 
  score." will be added to the COMMENT (#.3) sub file of the BCMA 
  MEDICATION LOG (#53.79) file.  Routines PSBOMH1, PSBOMT, PSBOCE1, PSBOCM1,
  PSBOML and PSBOCP were modified for the Medication Administration History 
  (MAH) report and other reports that may display the PRN Effectiveness but not
  comments.  These reports include the Medication Log, along with the Medication
  Overview, PRN Overview and Expired/DC'd/ Expiring Orders Coversheet reports.  
  The message "**This Pain Score may have been Entered in Error.  See Vitals 
  Package.** will be added to the end of the PRN Effectiveness on these reports.
  Routine PSBO was modified to check if a Pain Score was entered in error each 
  time a report is run that contains comments or PRN Effectiveness.
 
  2. HD0000000330712  Error - <UNDEFINED>SCANFAIL+9^PSBMLEN1
                     
  Problem:
  --------
  Receiving error "Error - <UNDEFINED>SCANFAIL+9^PSBMLEN1" when running 
  the MANUAL MEDICATION ENTRY [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option for an IV
  Piggyback (IVPB) medication that has a premixed solution with no additive.
  Also, the Solution will not be stored in the BCMA UNABLE TO SCAN LOG
  (#53.77) file.
 
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine PSBMLEN1 was modified so it no longer assumes an additive 
  exists preventing the undefined error.  Routine PSBVDLU3 was also 
  modified to store the solution in the BCMA UNABLE TO SCAN LOG (#53.77)
  file.
 
  3. HD0000000336728  <SUBSCRIPT>EN+12^PSBOMH1
                     
  Problem:
  --------
  Receiving error "<SUBSCRIPT>EN+12^PSBOMH1" when running the Medication 
  Administration History (MAH) report when the nurse that has given a 
  medication does not have their initials in the INITIAL (#1) field in the 
  NEW PERSON FILE (#200).
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine PSBOMH1 to allow a null string to be passed back for 
  nurses initials on the MAH if the users initials are not in the INITIAL 
  field (#1) of the NEW PERSON file (#200).
 
 4. HD0000000397966  Medication Therapy report does not contain PRN
    Effectiveness info
 
  Problem:
  --------
  The Medication Therapy report does not contain PRN Effectiveness
  information.
 
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine PSBOMT to include PRN Effectiveness information
  on the Medication Therapy report.
