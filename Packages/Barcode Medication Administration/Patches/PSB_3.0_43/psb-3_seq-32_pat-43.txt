 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000224103 - Meds intermittently do not display med admin history
 
   Problem
   -------
   When attempting to run the Medication Administration History (MAH) report 
   from within the BCMA application, the error message "Request Log Locked" 
   intermittently displays and the requested report is not produced.
 
   Resolution
   ----------
   The Medication Administration History report attempts to lock the BCMA 
   REPORT REQUEST file (#53.69) when starting. The routine PSBO1 has a lock 
   timeout of zero seconds. If the lock cannot be obtained, the error message 
   is displayed immediately. The lock timeout was changed to 30 seconds which 
   will allow the process that has locked the file to complete before 
   displaying the error message.
