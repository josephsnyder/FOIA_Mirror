Associated patches: (v)OR*3*304    <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMRC*3*70'

Subject: CONSULT NOTE ON WRONG PATIENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When a user was on the Consults tab of CPRS GUI v27 and the user timed 
 out, when they resumed work on the Consults, there was the potential to 
 attach the Consult Results to the wrong patient. 
  
 Also, in the past, there have been Consult Results attached to the wrong 
 patient due to a problem encountered during the upload process.
  
 This patch searches the entire REQUEST/CONSULTATION file for Consult
 Results that have the potential to be attached to the wrong patient
 record regardless of the source of the problem and creates a Mailman
 message containing a report of those records so they can be evaluated
 by the site and corrected, if needed.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000281049 - Consults ending up on wrong patient
  
 Problem:
 --------
 CPRS v27 could cause incorrect patient information to be displayed.  On 
 the Consults tab, when the incorrect patient information was displayed,
 the user could attach a result note to the wrong patient's record.
  
 Patch OR*3.0*304 corrected the incorrect patient display issue which 
 caused the Consult Result records to be attached to the wrong patient.  
 This patch identifies the consult records which have result records 
 attached to a different patient.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Created post-installation routine GMRCYP70 to search through the
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) looking for ASSOCIATED RESULTS.
  
 The patient IEN from the ASSOCIATED RESULTS file (8925, 691, 691.1, etc.) 
 is compared to the patient IEN stored on the consult in the 
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION file.  
  
 If the patient IEN values are different, the results are determined to 
 have the "potential" to be on the wrong patient and are written to the 
 report contained in a MailMan message.
  
 During installation of this patch, the installer will be prompted to 
 enter the names of the persons who should receive the MailMan message.
 The MailMan message will then be sent to those persons plus the installer
 of the patch.  The message will include the CONSULT #, CONSULT NAME,
 CONSULT DATE/TIME, CONSULT PT IEN, RESULT PT IEN, RESULT TYPE, RESULT DOC #,
 and the RESULT DATE/TIME.  The results will be sorted by division.
  
 The RESULT TYPE on the report represents the file number where the RESULT
 DOC # can be found.

 This message (1 of 1) has been sent by routine GMRCYP70 at the completion
 of the Consult Result evaluation.
   
 In the report below, the patient IEN from the ASSOCIATED RESULTS file (8925,
 691, 691.1, etc.) does not match the patient IEN stored on the consult
 in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file.
  
 A team including a Clinical Application Coordinator, Chief, Health
 Information Management, and other pertinent facility staff should
 review the results of the report generated by this patch. This step is
 critical to ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the Consult data at
 your facility.
  
 See the description for patch GMRC*3.0*70 in the National Patch Module
 for further explanation of this report and for instructions on how to
 correct the listed entries.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system.  Installation time
 will be less than 2 minutes.
  
 The post-install routine may run for several minutes to 1 hour depending 
 on the number of records it has to search through.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
  2.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               
           1      Load a Distribution

 POST-INSTALLATION
 =================
 A team including a Clinical Application Coordinator, Chief, Health 
 Information Management, and other pertinent facility staff shall be 
 formed to review the results of the report generated by this patch. 
 This step is critical to ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the
 Consult data at your facility.
  
 Because no automated functionality exists, each record on the report that 
 potentially has a consult report for a wrong patient must be reviewed to 
 determine that it actually does have an incorrect patient record.  Once 
 determined that it exists, the consult for the incorrect patient must be 
 printed before the incorrect record is deleted from the file (via VA 
 Filemanager).  A copy of the incorrect report along with documentation of 
 this process must be maintained at the facility.  It is recommended that 
 this action be reviewed and documented in your facility Medical Record 
 Committee (or equivalent).  Also, prior to deletion, each affected record 
 specified on this report must be manually reviewed to determine if the 
 incorrect consult attached to the record has been included in a release 
 of information.  If it has, the facility Chief, HIM and Privacy Act 
 Officer must review and take appropriate actions.  
  
  
 ----------- How to fix the mismatched consult/documents ---------------
 1.  Identify the correct document for the consult and determine
     the IEN of that document.
  
 2.  To remove the incorrect Document associated with the consult use 
     Enter/Edit FileMan.
     Select the Consult and delete the incorrect document from its
     associated Results using the following example.
  
     Select VA FileMan Option:  Enter or Edit File Entries
     INPUT TO WHAT FILE: REQUEST/CONSULTATION//  
     EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// 50 ASSOCIATED RESULTS (multiple)
     EDIT WHICH ASSOCIATED RESULTS SUB-FIELD: ALL// 
     THEN EDIT FIELD: 
     Select REQUEST/CONSULTATION FILE ENTRY DATE: `3972191 (IEN of the
                                                            consult)

 3.  To add the correct Document to the consult use Enter/Edit FileMan.
  
     Select the Consult and add the correct document to the Associated
     Result using the following example.
  
     Select REQUEST/CONSULTATION FILE ENTRY DATE:  `3972191 (IEN of the 
                                                             consult)
