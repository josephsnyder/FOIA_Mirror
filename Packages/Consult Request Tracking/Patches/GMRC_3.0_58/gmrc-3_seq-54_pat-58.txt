Subject: UNKNOWN PATIENT ERROR REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch makes updates to the IFC Patient Error Report (#201) by 
 including the Ordered Service for the first report received at 3 hours,
 by setting the priority of the SUICIDE HOTLINE Consult messages, and by 
 correcting the "from" in the 24 hour report.  This patch also creates two 
 new error reports #702 "Service is Disabled" and #703 "Procedure is 
 Inactive" to alert the user when a service/procedure is 
 disabled/inactivated by the Consulting Site.  Updates to the 
 Inter-Facility Implementation Guide have also been made to include the 
 two new reports.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1.  HD0000000206372    2 IFC error messages need enhancement
  
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 1a. The Patient Error Report (#201) sent at 3 hours does not contain the
     Ordered Service, but the same report sent at 12 hours does contain the
     Ordered Service.
  
 1b. SUICIDE HOTLINE Consults are sent with a normal priority.
  
 1c. The 24 hour report has the Consulting Site as the "from" in the 
     message body instead of the Requesting Site.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 1a.  Modify NW^GMRCIACT to send variable OBR (set from 
      ^TMP("GRMCIN",$J,"OBR")) when calling PTERRMSG^GMRCIERR.
  
 1b.  Modify PTERRMSG^GMRCIERR to set the priority flag for Ordered 
      Services containing "SUICIDE HOTLINE".
  
 1c.  Modify EN^GMRCIBKG to correctly send the value of the Requesting Site
      to PTERRMSG^GMRCIERR.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000193888    VAMHCS-Disabled Consult Service still receiving 
                        IFC requests.
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 2a. The Consulting Site is able to receive Consult Requests for Consult 
     Services that have been disabled by the Consulting Site.
  
 2b. The Consulting Site is able to receive Consult Requests for 
     Procedures that have been disabled by the Consulting Site.
  
 Resolution 2:
 ------------- 
 2a & 2b. Modify EN^GMRCIBKG and GMRCIUTL to produce two new report errors
          #702 Service is Disabled and #703 Procedure Is Inactive to alert
          the user when the Consulting Site has disabled/inactivated the
          requested Consult or Procedure. The Consulting Site will no
          longer receive disabled or inactivated requests.
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 The revised INTER-FACILITY CONSULTS Implementation Guide is available 
 on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of 
 Information (OI) Field Offices. These files should be retrieved
 in binary format.
     
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the file from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from 
      the first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
        Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
 The documentation distribution includes:
