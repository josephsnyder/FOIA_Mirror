Subject: INTER-FACILITY CONSULTS NOT TRANSMITTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses Patient Safety Issue PSPO #1619, an issue which 
 causes an Inter-Facility Consult (IFC) to appear as a local consult and 
 not transmit correctly to the consulting site.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000342037 - IFC consult not showing in system as IFC
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering an Interfacility Consult request, if a user copies data into
 the Provisional Diagnosis field by utilizing the cut, copy and paste
 functions (CNTL-X, CNTL-C, CNTL-V, or through menu options), unseen
 control characters may be introduced in the data.
  
 When the data is stored to a file, the control characters captured from
 the cut & paste cause an error during the save which leaves the file
 incomplete.  The missing data just happens to be needed to determine if
 the Consult Request is an Inter-Facility Consult.  Since the consult is
 not recognized as an IFC, it is never transmitted to the consulting site.
  
 Since the consulting site does not receive the consult order, the consult 
 is not performed, possibly causing harm to the patient.  This has resulted
 in Patient Safety Issue PSPO #1619.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The resolution will be in 2 parts:
 1.  Routine GMRCHL7A was modified to remove any control characters from
     the Provisional Diagnosis field before saving the data. 
  
 2.  A post-init routine, GMRCYP68, will examine the system and determine
     when the IFC functionality was installed and then will search the
     REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file for any entries back to that date,
     in a "ACTIVE", "PARTIAL RESULTS", "PENDING", or "SCHEDULED" status and
     appearing as local consults but should have been IFCs.  
  
     When the patch installation is completed and some bad IFCs were found,
     a MailMan message will be sent to the installer.  This message should
     be forwarded to the appropriate Clinical Application Coordinator or
     others responsible for the Consult/Request package at your site for
     their review.  The patch does not make any changes to existing 
     consults - they can only be changed by following the instructions in
     the MailMan message.
  
     If no bad IFCs were found, no Mailman message will be sent but the
     following message will be displayed during the install.
  
     Starting Post-init...
  
     Searching for Consult Request which should be Inter-Facility
     Consults, but are displaying as local Consults.
  
     0 Total Invalid IFC Consult Request Records Found.
  
     No invalid entries found.
  
     Post-init complete.
  
  
 Sample MailMan Message:
 -----------------------
 Subj: GMRC*3*68 - IFC CONSULTS NOT SENT  [#588209]     07/28/10@09:38  
 From: PATCH GMRC*3.0*68 POST-INIT  In 'IN' basket.     Page 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This message has been sent by patch GMRC*3.0*68 at the completion of
 the post-init routine.
  
 This message was sent because Inter-Facility Consult records were found
 which were not sent as Inter-Facility Consults and appear as local
 Consults. These IFC Consults are listed in this Mailman message so the
 proper action may be taken to correct the erroneous IFC Consult Request
 Records. We have identified two different ways in which sites may correct
 these incorrect IFC entries:
  
   Option 1: After identifying and verifying the problem entry, forward the
             problem entry to a different consult service/procedure and 
             then forward the entry back to the original service/procedure.
             This action will correct the problem and allow the consult to
             transmit properly to the consulting facility. If this option
             is used, it is suggested the forwarding to service be made
             aware of these pending actions and a standard message be
             devised to be included as a comment for the effected consult
             entries.
  
  
   Option 2: After identifying and verifying the problem entry, contact
             the ordering provider to determine if the order is still
             needed. Have the provider Discontinue the order. If the
             order was no longer needed, then this is all that is needed.
             If the order is needed, then the provider should re-order
             it. Sites may want to create a standardized message for the
             discontinued orders and new orders if appropriate.

 POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 Check the messages displayed during the install.  If you get the message 
 that no records were found, you may delete the routine GMRCYP68.
  
 If you get the message that records were found, check your mail for the 
 message 'GMRC*3*68 - IFC CONSULTS NOT SENT' and forward it to the 
 appropriate staff.
  
 If you need to rerun the post-init routine, you may do so at the 
 programmer's prompt:
  
 >D POST^GMRCYP68
  
 This will generate a new MailMan message if records are found or will 
 display the message that no records were found if the clean up efforts 
 were successful.
  
 NOTE:
 =====
 There is an existing 'Lock missing Timeout' error displayed when utilizing
 XINDEX.  This error is not being addressed by this patch but is being
 rectified in patch GMRC*3.0*66.
