Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports two enhancements:
 1. Add the ability to identify patients eligible for scheduling
    preference based on Combat Veteran status.  Specifically, this patch 
    supports the request to display the combat veteran eligibility status
    on the Consults SF 513.
 2. Alter the format of the SF 513 such that:
    2.1 Patient demographic data is moved to the header.
    2.2 Patient demographics are printed at the top of each page.
    2.3 Page numbers are printed at the bottom of each page in the 
        following format: Page 1 of 3, Page 2 of 3, etc).
  
 If the patient's combat veteran eligibility status is still valid, the 
 SF513 will display the following information immediately below the 
 Primary Eligibility:
  
 Combat Vet Eligible:           YES
  
 For eligible patients, this marker will display when:
 1. Viewing consult/procedure request details in CPRS GUI or List Manager.
 2. Displaying the SF 513 in CPRS GUI via the Action menu.
 3. Printing a hard copy SF 513 from CPRS GUI or List Manager.
