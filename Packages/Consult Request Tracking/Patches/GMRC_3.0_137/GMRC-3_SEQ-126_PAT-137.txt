  - Informational

Description:
============

  
 **************************************************************************
 This is an informational patch explaining changes in Consult Toolbox.
 NOTE: This patch is loaded on individual PC workstations via SCCM 
 software update push from local/regional OIT. 
 There is nothing that local sites can or need to do besides communicate 
 changes to the clinical users. No code changes were made to the Consult 
 application to accommodate these enhancements. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 Version 1.9.0054 modifies the Consult Toolbox application as described 
 below: 
  
 1. The CTB User Interface has been updated as follows:

       options. New options have been added for New Community Care Program.
  
    b. The Forward to Community Care panel has been updated as follows:
       i.   "Nature of simplicity of service (UEXB)" changed to "Nature of
            simplicity of service"
       ii.  "Explain (UEXB)" changed to "Explain"
       iii. "Unusual or Excessive travel Burden (type and explanation of 
            UEXB required)" removed as an option
  
    c. The ability to select a Category of Care from a drop down list has 
       been added to the Authorization tab  
  
    d. The MSA Elig. Verification tab/Specific Eligibility Verified has 
       been modified to add the following options:
       i.   "Drive Time not Distance"
       ii.  "BMI - Hardship"
       iii. "BMI-BMI per Episode of Care"
       iv.  "Quality Standard not met"
       v.   "Grandfathered under Choice"
       vi.  "No Full Service available VA in State"
  
    e. The MSA Elig. Verification tab/Specific Eligibility Verified has 
       been modified to remove the following options:
       i.   "Air, Boat, Ferry" 
       ii.  "UEXB-Geographical Challenges"
       iii. "UEXB-Environmental Factors"
       iv.  "UEXB-Medical Condition"
       v.   "UEXB-Nature or simplicity of services"
    
    f. The "Send to HSRM" functionality has been updated to insert a copy
       of the last inserted SEOC after the ICR Consult Factor to allow 
       ingestion by HSRM.
  
 2. The following DST related functionality has been updated:
    a. DST has been updated to detect Chrome browser tab closure and/or 
       Chrome browser window closure
    b. Consult information is now passed from CTB to DST so complete 
       context is available when DST is launched from a signed consult
    c. The Link DST Data window has been eliminated, and text is 
       directly inserted into the Reason for Request field
    d. DST can now be opened regardless of what information is passed as 
       a CID
    e. CTB has been updated to work with DST Auto Forwarding functionality 
  
 This software was created by the Atlanta VA Medical Center in response to 
 a need to manage the process of consult management. During the life of a 
 consult, there are prescribed steps of actions to be taken, and there is 
 a need to be able track these steps at an individual patient level. 
 Additionally, there is a need to be able to understand the overall status 
 of consult management at a macro level, and identify specific services 
 needing attention or resources. Without opening and reading a patient 
 medical record, it is difficult to identify which patients have had which 
 scheduling steps completed.
  
 This software does several things. First, it makes it very easy for staff 
 to document actions completed quickly and consistently. Second, it uses 
 consistent verbiage to document these steps. Third, it eliminates the 
 need to take a second action or make a separate entry to track scheduling 
 steps. Fourth, this consistent verbiage allows software analysis of 
 records without needing to have software changes to VistA or CPRS.
  
 A separate process using corporate data warehouse queries and reports 
 allows creation of views showing such things as patients who have not had 
 first call, second call, scheduling letter sent or how much time has 
 passed between these events.
  
 Together, these allow tracking and managing consults without the need to 
 keep a separate list or other workflow to know which consults need 
 attention.
  
  
 Additional Information:
 ----------------------- 
 This software watches keyboard and mouse activity, and comes to life 
 when certain conditions occur.
  
 1. It only activates when the currently active windows title 
    "Receive Consult", "Add Comment to Consult" or "Discontinue Consult." 
    Otherwise nothing happens 
  
 2. When the user initiates a trigger event when either of 
    these windows have the focus, then depending on the open window a menu 
    appears for the user to select the appropriate action, then the
    software inserts the appropriate text into the comment box.
  
 3. The defined trigger is a right mouse click in the supported CPRS 
    consult actions.
