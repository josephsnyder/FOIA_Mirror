Description:
============

 This patch will update the CONSULTS PERFORMANCE MONITOR REPORT [GMRC RPT 
 PERF MONITOR] to reflect the revised FY08 national performance monitors
 for consult completion rates.
  
 The timely scheduling and completion with results of consults and 
 procedure requests within CPRS is critical to effective communication 
 between the requesting clinician and the specialty care service.  The 
 timeliness of this communication also impacts the overall satisfaction of 
 our veteran patients as related to communication of test or consultation 
 results.  A delay in the clinical completion and/or communication of 
 consultation and procedure results has a potentially negative impact on 
 the provision of timely and safe healthcare to the veteran patient.  In 
 an ongoing effort to improve the processes related to timely transmission 
 and clinical completion of consult results, the monitor of 
 consult/procedure completion has been revised.
  
 Final completion rate definitions will be posted here:

 b_performance_measures/2008_perf_meas/Monitors/MonitorsFY2008-FINALreforma
 tted.doc
  
 The FY08 update to the monitor definitions has four areas of measurement:
  1. Monitor #1 (Quarterly report until 100%): Implementation of use of 
 Class I Consult-Scheduling Appointment Linkage Software.
  2. Monitor #2 (Quarterly report): Percentage  of all consults for 
 outpatient procedures and other types of outpatient specialty care 
 services requested since 30 days before beginning of this quarter and 
 until 30 days before the end of this quarter, that have been clinically 
 completed with results within 30 days of request (or within 30 days of 
 the "soonest appropriate date for this service" once CPRS Version 28 has 
 been released to provide for entry of this field associated with each 
 consult request).  
  3. Monitor #3 (Quarterly report): Percentage of all consults for
 outpatient procedures and other types of outpatient specialty care
 services requested since 60 days before beginning of this quarter and
 until 60 days before the end of this quarter, that have been clinically
 completed with results within 60 days of request (or within 60 days of the
 "soonest appropriate date for this service" once CPRS Version 28 has been
 released to provide for entry of this field associated with each consult
 request).  
  4. Monitor # 4 (All quarters):   Percentage of unresolved consults 
 requested at any time prior to 60 days before the beginning of the quarter
 for which reporting.
  
 Given the variance of practice across VHA and the flexibility of the 
 Consults/Request Tracking software, it is important to note that the 
 report does not attempt to exclude any procedure requests, requests for 
 Non-VA care, or non-formulary drug requests.  Sites will need to make 
 local decisions about which services are appropriate for inclusion in the 
 report and/or further refine the report output prior to submitting data 
 for the national reporting requirement. In addition, this patch only
 addresses monitors #2-4; monitor #1 is not included in the Consults
 Performance Monitor.  
  
 The report will exclude the following types of requests:
 -Administrative requests as marked via the new fields in files 123 and 
  123.5
 -Requests placed for a test patient
 -Requests to services flagged as part of the interface between 
  Consults/Request Tracking and Prosthetics
 -Requests not specifically identified as "OUPATIENT" via the SERVICE 
  RENDERED AS IN OR OUT field of file 123.
  
 The report data is built using the "AE" cross-reference of file 123.  
 This is a cross-reference of TO SERVICE, CPRS STATUS, and DATE OF 
 REQUEST.  If an entry in file 123 is missing values for any of these 
 fields, that entry will not be present in the index and therefore 
 excluded from the report.
