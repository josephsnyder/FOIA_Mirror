Subject: DECISION SUPPORT TOOL V1.1

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Description:
 ------------
 This patch is a modification to the existing Decision Support Tool (DST) that 
 is used in conjunction with Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and 
 the Community Care directives. This patch supports the new feature of 
 AutoForwarding to the DST. 
 
 When a consult has been determined to require forwarding by the DST software, 
 the content of the data returned by DST to the Order will indicate that this 
 consult should be AutoForwarded. The new function will look for this new data 
 which will contain the name of the consult being forwarded to, and then this 
 software will use the existing forwarding functionality in CPRS and 
 automatically forward the consult.
 
 For Story 1076064, this Functionality adds the feature of AutoForwarding 
 functionality to CPRS. When the Decision Support Tool returns
 a value of YES in the "DAF-DST Forwarding:" text the CPRS
 Forward functionality will be invoked and the consult
 will be forwarded to the consult named in the
 "AFD-DST Forward To:" text.

 Context Root component for DST GET ID SERVICE has changed from
 vs/v1/consultFactor to vs/v2/consultFactor. The Post Processor
 will make this change.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 Should it become necessary to back out this patch. A reinstallation of
 the installation save set will restore the routine GMRCDST to the
 GMRC*3.0*124 version. 
 It is possible to re-install patch GMRC*3.0*124 which will overwrite
 the GMRC*3.0*139 version of the GMRCDST routine. However it is then
 necessary to verify the WEB SERVER and WEB SERVICE settings for DST
 as the GMRC*3.0*124 patch will modify those values.
