 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  HD0000000214417 -  Consult # & description not printing correctly.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The SF 513 report only allows for a Consult Name of 38 characters to 
     print before the Consult No. starts printing in column 55.  If the
     Consult Name is longer than 38 characters, the report will print the
     rest of the Consult Name after the Consult No. prints.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify HDR^GMRCP5D to print the Consult No. on the line following the 
     Consult Name at column 55.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000067640 - Reports not pulling same Completion #
    
     Problem:
     --------
     The Completion Time Statistics and Print Completion Time Statistics
     reports will not print completed consults for the last date entered.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify ODTSTR^GMRCSTU to add 1 to variable GMRCDT2 to allow the last
     date to be printed on reports.
