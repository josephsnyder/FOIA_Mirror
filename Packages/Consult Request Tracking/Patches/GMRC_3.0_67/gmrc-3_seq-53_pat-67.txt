Subject: LOCAL COMPLETION RATE REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch GMRC*3.0*60, FY08 UPDATE CONSULTS PERFORMANCE MONITOR, updated the 
 Consults Performance Monitor report [GMRC RPT PERF MONITOR] to the fiscal 
 year 2008 performance monitor definitions.  In making the report option 
 comply with the updated definitions, sites no longer have the ability to
 use the option to locally track completion rates in an effort to improve 
 process and thereby improve performance on the national monitor.
  
 This patch will create a new reporting option under the CONSULTS 
 TRACKING REPORT [GMRC REPORTS] menu called CONSULTS LOCAL COMPLETION RATE
 [GMRC RPT LOCAL COMPLETE RATE]. This report is essentially a mirror of
 the report functionality found in the original Consults Performance
 Monitor report (GMRC*3.0*41) with one minor enhancement. The patch will
 provide the local sites with an option to generate a report listing
 consults requested, consults completed, consult completion rates,
 completed consults with results attached and rate of completed consults
 with results attached for a user determined date range. Similar to 
 other GMRC reports, the original DATE OF REQUEST field from the
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION file is the date value used to filter report 
 data. The output is either an easy to read summary format, or a comma
 delimited format for importing into spreadsheet or database software.  If
 a disabled service is included in the report, it will be marked as such
 for easy identification.  For example, SERVICE: ARTHRITIS   <disabled>
   
 The following consults will be excluded from the report:
 *Prosthetics consults where the service is identified as linked between 
  the Consult/Request Tracking and Prosthetics packages.
 *Consults with a status of Cancelled or Discontinued.
 *Inter-facility Consults (IFC) requests where the reporting site is the
  sending site for the IFC.
 *Consults created for test patients
