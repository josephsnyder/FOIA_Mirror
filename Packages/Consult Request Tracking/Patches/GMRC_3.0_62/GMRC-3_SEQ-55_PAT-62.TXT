Description:
============

 This patch corrects the Service Consults Schedule-Management Report [GMRC
 RPT SD SCH-MGT CONSULTS] option to allow printing of all services under
 the Service/Specialty entered regardless of where it falls in the
 hierarchy. Help text (?SH) is also added for that same option.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:

 1.  HD0000000205175    SH report not working correctly
      Duplicate: 
       HD0000000168769    Service Consults Schedule-Management Report
  
    Problem:
    --------
    1.  When the Service Consults Schedule-Management Report [GMRC
    RPT SD SCH-MGT CONSULTS] option is printed for grouper services, if
    there are services in two deep or more from the grouper entered those
    services will not print on the report.
  
    2.  The PSI Workgroup recommended adding help text (?SH) same option 
    (from the menu).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    1.  Modify START^GMRCONS1 to include all services in the hierarchy 
    related to the user's selection in the array the report uses to print
    the results.
  
    2.  Add help text to the description for Service Consults 
    Schedule-Management Report [GMRC RPT SD SCH-MGT CONSULTS] option.
