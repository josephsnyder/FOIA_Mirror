Subject: CONSULT STATUS REPORT TOTALS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following items in the CONSULT/REQUEST 
 TRACKING package:
  
 1.  When 80 column Consult Service reports are run to the screen or
     printer with long consult service names, truncation can occur,
     resulting in false interpretation of the report.
  
 2.  When running the Service Consult by Status report for pending 
     consults, the report quits before reaching the end of the report.  
  
 3.  The Consult Service reports have different totals when run for a
     grouper than by the individual services when the services can be 
     found in multiple groupers.
  
 4.  When running the Consult Service reports for ALL SERVICES and ALL
     STATUSES, the reports do not print anything for a Consult Service
     if that service had no requests (0) for the time frame specified.
  
 5.  Using the option GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES [Set up Consult 
     Services], the user receives an undefined error when deleting a
     Consult Service at the SERVICE NAME prompt.
  
 6.  When alerted for ORDERER-FLAGGED RESULTS, FLAGGED OI RESULTS - 
     OUTPT or FLAGGED OI RESULTS - INPT, only one command "DD", "RT",
     or "PT" can be used.  After that, all the actions do not produce any
     output.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000067624 - PR and PC report options don't agree
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When 80 column Consult Service reports (PC, CC, CP, IFC, IR, NU, and SC)
   are run to the screen or printer with long consult service names,
   truncation occurs.  The truncation can be in the total amounts and could
   lead to false interpretation of the report.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify LISTTOT^GMRCSTL1 to reformat how the totals sections is printed 
   for Service and Groupers.  The new format will look more like the
   Consult Performance Monitor Report's totals section.
  
   Update the examples in the Consult/Request Tracking Technical Manual and
   the Inter-Facility Consults Implementation Guide to show the new report 
   format.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000090619 - Consult tracking report problem
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When running the Consult Services reports for pending consults,
   the "enter" value switches to "Quit" before end of the report.  After 
   using the arrows to position the report to receive the Quit, the page 
   numbers are invalid.  Then, after the  "Quit" is received, the down
   arrow will not work until another key is used.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify LISTTOT^GMRCSTL1 to increase the variable COUNT inside of the
   loop "I GMRCTOTS D" instead of immediately prior to the loop.  
  
  
 3.  HD0000000068174 - Accuracy of Consult Status Reports
  
   Problem:
   --------
   The Service Consults by Status "SC" reports have different totals if run
   for a grouper than by the individual services when there are services
   that can be found in multiple groupers.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify ADDTOT^GMRCSTL2 and STAT^GMRCSTLM to omit duplicate service
   totals from the total section.
  
   Note:
   -----
   A consult service appearing as part of the Consult service hierarchy in 
   more than one place (i.e. a sub-service of more than one parent) has the
   potential to skew the results of the Consult Performance Monitor Report 
   [GMRC RPT PERF MONITOR].
  
  
 4.  HD0000000067632  PUG-0503-50941  Cons rpt doesn't show svc if '0'
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When running the Consult Service reports for ALL SERVICES and ALL
   STATUSES, the reports do not print anything for a Consult Service if
   that service had no requests (0) for the time frame specified. This 
   was causing the users to think that those services were not part of 
   the Consult Hierarchy.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify PRINTST^GMRCSTLM to print a listing of services whose total 
   requests were zero (0) for the time frame selected. 
  
  
 5.  HD0000000241239 - UNDEFINED error when deleting a service
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Using the option SET UP CONSULT SERVICES, the user receives an undefined
   error when deleting a Consult Service at the SERVICE NAME prompt.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify EN^GMRCSRVS to check to see if the service is deleted before 
   executing the code at EN+13.
  
  
 6.  HD0000000173664 - "RT" won't display document in VISTA for flagged 
                       OI-when resulted alert
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When alerted for ORDERER-FLAGGED RESULTS, FLAGGED OI RESULTS - 
   OUTPT or FLAGGED OI RESULTS - INPT, only one command "DD", "RT",
   or "PT" can be used.  After that, all the actions do not produce any
   output.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   SET^GMRCSLM1 resets GMRCDA and GMRCIFN to the + value of XQADATA which 
   for this alert is the order number and not the consult number.  Recode 
   the logic to correctly pull the consult number "IF" the order number is 
   included in the alert.  Modify ENTRY^GMRCSLMA to correctly display the 
   page number after refreshing the screen.
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 The revised NURSE'S USER MANUAL and PHARMACIST'S USER MANUAL is 
 available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the 
 following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These files 
 should be retrieved in binary format.
     
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from 
      the first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
        Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
      The documentation distribution includes:
  
      File Name      Description                                   Protocol
