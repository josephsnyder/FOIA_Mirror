Subject: Release of IHTA 6.0.0

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch is to announce that the IHTA 6.0.0 updates to 
 the Integrated Home Telehealth Application (IHTA) will be nationally 
 rolled out Saturday, March 29, 2014, beginning at 12:00 PM 
 ET.
  
 IHTA 6.0.0 builds on the current IHTA 5.5.0 release with enhancements to 
 the HT Reports, Inventory Tracker (Manage QIRs), and the DMP Development 
 Process modules of IHTA. Enhancements to the HT Reports module include 
 the ability to search on aggregate patient survey response data (V1.0, 
 2.0, and VR-12) from the Health Data Repository (HDR) to view the 
 following reports:
 - Distribution of Surveys
 - Satisfaction Survey Results
 - Satisfaction Survey Trend Charts
 - Vendor Submission Report
 - VR-12 Surveys
  
 Also included in this release are enhancements to the Manage Quality 
 Improvement Reports (QIR) functionality of the Inventory Tracker module 
 and to the DMP Development Process Tool.
 IHTA is a Web-based portal application sponsored by the VHA Office of 
 Telehealth Services (OTS).  IHTA is designed to provide a flexible, 
 maintainable, and resilient platform for Home Telehealth (HT) business 
 functions.  Each business function supported by IHTA is constructed as an 
 application module of IHTA.  IHTA 6.0.0 includes the following modules:  
 My Profile, Administration, Inventory Tracker, which includes the Manage 
 QIR functionality, DMP Development Process, and HT Reports.  Details on 
 each module are provided below:
 - Inventory Tracker: Designed to enable Care Coordinators and Program 
 Support Assistants (PSA) to generate reports on device availability and 
 vendor compliance.  Reports can be saved for later viewing in native, 
 Excel, and PDF formats.  To round out this module, three searches provide 
 the capability to search for home devices/appliances based on serial 
 number, activation date, and patient name.  
 - Manage QIRs: Inventory Tracker also contains the Manage QIR 
 functionality, which allows Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT) 
 staff to electronically submit, process, track, and print QIRs that 
 document quality and patient safety issues related to HT devices.  This 
 functionality replaces the legacy VA Reporting and Processing Medical 
 Materiel Complaints/ Quality Improvement Report form (VA Form 0729).
 - Administration: Provides IHTA administrators with the ability to 
 approve or reject registrations and assign roles to users.  This module 
 also allows administrators to manage and schedule batch jobs (i.e., 
 Weekly Vendor Compliance Report E-mail, Purge Completed Reports, Vendor 
 Response Due Date).
 - DMP Development Process: Provides DMP Administrators and assigned VHA 
 Subject Matter Experts (SME) with the ability to create and update DMPs 
 and their associated clinician alerts and patient health information in a 
 Web-based development tool.
 - HT Reports: Provides Home Telehealth management with the ability to 
 search on aggregate HT response data from the Health Data Repository 
 (HDR) to produce and export to Excel various reports.
 - My Profile: Allows the user to view his/her system information and 
 adjust personal application settings.
  
 Intended users of IHTA include National, Veterans Integrated Service 
 Network (VISN) and Facility Administrators, Care Coordinators, PSAs, 
 Program Office Managers, National Home Telehealth Training Center (NHTTC) 
 staff, and VHA SMEs.
