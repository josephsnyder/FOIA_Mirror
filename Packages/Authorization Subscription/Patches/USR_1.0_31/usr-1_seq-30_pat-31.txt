Description:
============

              ******************************************************
                   Sites must change exported ASU Business Rules   
              ******************************************************
  
 As a result of an Office of Inspector General (OIG) inspection and in
 accordance with VHA Handbook 1907.01, certain exported ASU Business Rules
 are to be changed.  There are 3 sets of rules to be changed, LR ANATOMIC
 PATHOLOGY rules, rules referencing obsolete Status PURGED, and rules for
 deleting documents of status DELETED.
  
 This patch provides instructions for making these changes.
  
 These changes require access to the User Class Management option on the
 TIU MAINTENANCE MENU.
  
  
 I.  Changes to LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY Rules
     ======================================
  
 For the first set of changes, use Search Category DOCUMENT DEFINITION
 under option Manage Business Rules, and select LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY (the
 Document Class). Then EDIT each rule, changing the User Class as described
 below.
  
                   ******* Warning *******
     Do NOT DELETE these LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY rules!
                       ***************
  
  
 Sites must change the current User Class (LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS)
 for these existing rules:
  
 1    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE AMENDED by 
 a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS
  
 2    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may HAVE ITS 
 TITLE CHANGED by a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS
  
 3    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE COPIED by 
 a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS 
  
 4    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE DELETED by 
 a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS
  
 5    An UNTRANSCRIBED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE 
 ENTERED by a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS
  
 6    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may HAVE 
 SIGNERS IDENTIFIED by a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS
  
 7    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE ADDENDED 
 by a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS 
  
 8    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE PRINTED by 
 a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS
  
 9    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE REASSIGNED 
 by a LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS
  
  
 The User Class in these 9 exported rules must be changed to: 
   CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM if your site has that class instead]
  
  
 Your changed rules should look like this:
  
 1    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE AMENDED by 
 a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 2    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may HAVE ITS 
 TITLE CHANGED by a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 3    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE COPIED by 
 a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 4    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE DELETED by 
 a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 5    An UNTRANSCRIBED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE 
 ENTERED by a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 6    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may HAVE 
 SIGNERS IDENTIFIED by a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 7    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE ADDENDED 
 by a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 8    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE PRINTED by 
 a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 9    A COMPLETED (DOCUMENT CLASS) LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY may BE REASSIGNED 
 by a CHIEF, MIS [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
  
                   ******* Warning *******
     Do NOT DELETE these rules for LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY!
                       ***************
  
  
     Why LR ANATOMIC PATH rules MUST NOT BE DELETED
     ==============================================
 These rules prohibit permissions regarding these actions from being
 inherited from TIU Document Class CLINICAL DOCUMENTS.  If these rules 
 were deleted, incorrect permissions would be inherited from CLASS 
 CLINICAL DOCUMENTS. These rules (with a changed User Class) MUST CONTINUE
 TO EXIST as Business Rules to avoid this unwanted inheritance.
  
     Where the LR ANATOMIC PATH rules came from
     ==========================================    
 These rules were created when the following option, exported by 
 TIU*1*137, was run after patch installation:
   Create DDEFS, Rules for Anat Path [TIU137 DDEFS & RULES, ANATPATH]
 The rules concern documents completed in the Lab Anatomic Pathology
 package and automatically entered into the TIU DOCUMENT FILE. Any
 necessary changes to these documents must be made through Lab,
 not TIU or CPRS GUI.
  
 Although these rules may look like they PERMITTED actions, they actually 
 prohibited actions since the User Class LR ANATOMIC PATH EMPTY CLASS does 
 not have any members (unless someone has been entered by mistake into 
 that class).  However, someone COULD be entered by mistake into that
 class, and the OIG has stated that these rules must be changed.
  
  
 II.  Changes to Rules Referencing Obsolete Status PURGED
      ===================================================
  
 Sites must DELETE Rules Referencing Obsolete Status PURGED.
  
 To delete these rules referencing Status PURGED you must have access to
 the TIU MAINTENANCE MENU, User Class Management option. Use Search
 Category DOCUMENT DEFINITION, select Document Definition CLINICAL 
 DOCUMENT, select action FIND, and find 'PURGED'. Then delete each rule
 referencing Status PURGED.
  
 We are aware of the following rules referencing Status PURGED:
  
 1. A PURGED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may BE DELETED by a CHIEF, MIS
 2. A PURGED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may BE VIEWED by a USER
  
  
 Although these rules are not in effect since no document has status 
 PURGED, please delete them to avoid misunderstanding.
  
  
 III.  Change to Rules Permitting Deletion of documents of status DELETED.
       ===================================================================
  
  For this change, use Search Category DOCUMENT DEFINITION, select Document
 Definition CLINICAL DOCUMENT, select action FIND, and find  'A DELETED'.
  
 We expect that you will find 2 rules regarding deleting Clinical Documents
 of status DELETED:
  
 A DELETED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may BE DELETED by a Clinical 
 Coordinator 
  
 A DELETED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may BE DELETED by a CHIEF, MIS 
 [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
 Delete the first rule, the rule for Clinical Coordinators.
  
 You will then have only one rule regarding deleting Clinical Documents of
 status DELETED:
  
 A DELETED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may BE DELETED by a CHIEF, MIS 
 [or CHIEF, HIM]
  
  
     Deleting a Deleted Document - Some History
     ==========================================
 When TIU was released in 1997, there was no way to remove a faulty 
 document from general view while maintaining it intact electronically for 
 legal purposes.  When a completed document was deleted (a rare event), 
 the text was deleted from the record, leaving only a stub record of 
 status DELETED, and an audit record of the Delete action.  
  
 Now, with the existing "Retract" functionality, when the Delete action is 
 taken on a completed document the original document is kept intact in a 
 RETRACTED status.  Documents are no longer given status DELETED.
 However, old documents of that status may still exist.
  
 Deleting a DELETED document (i.e., a stub document) essentially changed it
 from status DELETED to status RETRACTED.  This allowed sites who chose to
 do so to eliminate documents of status DELETED.  We know of no mandate or
 recommendation to do this; we are merely explaining the likely source of
 the rule permitting Clinical Coordinators to Delete DELETED documents.
  
 Although the rule does not IN FACT remove the document from the 
 discoverable record, the rule APPEARS to allow a broad group, Clinical 
 Coordinators, to do so.  This rule must therefore be deleted so that 
 Clinical Coordinators no longer have such permission.

 V. Documentation:
 =================
 Two TIU Manuals have been updated to reflect the changes described in this
 patch. The updated documentation is available in the form of (.PDF) files,
 as follows:
  
    PDF File    Manual                                   Download Format
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    TIUUM.PDF   TIU Clinical Coordinator & User Manual   BINARY
    TIUIM.PDF   TIU Implementation Guide                 BINARY
  
 These files can be retrieved in BINARY format by FTP. The preferred
 method is to FTP the files from
  
     download.vista.med.va.gov    
  
 which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
 The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP location
 at the following locations:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------

    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
    The documentation can also be found on the System Design and
    Development Web page: (http://www.va.gov/vdl).
