  - Routine

Description:
============

 I. Description:
    ===========
  
 Description:
  
 Patch USR*1*33 supports the Reminders Polytrauma Marker patch PXRM*2*17.
 Patches USR*1*33 and PXRM*2*17 are sent out together in a
 single distribution, with PXRM*2*17 requiring  USR*1*33.
  
 Patch USR*1*33 changes displays of User Class Names in Authorization and
 Subscription Utility (ASU) options. User Class Names are now shown by the
 name of the entry in the User Class File (File #8930).  Previously they
 were shown by their display names. In particular, the User Class
 Definition Option [USR CLASS DEFINITION] has been changed to show the
 entry name of the User Class.
  
 The User Class Definition Option [USR CLASS DEFINITION] is found under
 the User Class Management Menu [USR CLASS MANAGEMENT MENU], which is 
 found under the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU].
  
 In addition, the module used to list what User Classes a particular user
 belongs to has been enhanced. It may now be set to list classes by entry
 name rather than by display name if desired.
  
 These changes are necessary because it is the entry name of the Class
 which users see in User Class edits and various ASU modules. Using the
 same name in displays avoids confusion.
  
 Technical Description:
 Note that ASU options are sometimes referred to as USR options since USR 
 is the namespace used.
  
 The entry name now used in User Class lists is the NAME, field .01 of the
 entry in file 8930.  The name previously used was the DISPLAY NAME, field
 .04 in file 8930.
  
 The enhanced module which list classes a user belongs to, is WHATIS^USRLM.
 The enhancement is backward compatible, with a new optional parameter,
 NAME01.  If NAME01 is sent equal to 1, the .01 Name is used.
