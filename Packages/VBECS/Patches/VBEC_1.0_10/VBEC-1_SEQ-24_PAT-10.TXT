Description:
============

 VBEC*1.0*10 is exported as part of the VistA Blood Establishment 
 Computer System (VBECS) Version 1.5.1.0 release.
  
 VBECS related VistA patches require customer validation in local 
 Test accounts prior to installation in Production to meet Food & 
 Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the 
 Blood Bank software for its intended use prior to its acceptance 
 and use for patient care.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that OI&T Field Operations coordinate 
 the installation of Blood Bank software patches with Pathology & 
 Laboratory Medicine Service staff to allow adequate time for impact 
 analysis and testing the changes prior to installation in Production. 
  
  
 The VBEC*1.0*10 patch, in conjunction with LR*5.2*401 address several
 issues. Refer to the VBECS 1.5.1.0 Release Notes for sample validation 
 scenarios: 
  
  1. 086 Vista MR 110909 - This will implement an improved validation 
     method of the LRBL and VBEC namespaced routines during the 
     quarterly integrity check by no longer calling the LRBLINTG 
     routine; instead the new VBECSRV routine will be used to utilize 
     MailMan server functionality to retrieve all checksum updates.
  
  2. 087 VistA MR 112309 - This will correct workload reporting 
     problems with the workload code suffix, also called the workload 
     method. The suffix is converted to a pointer to the 
     WKLD SUFFIX CODES (#64.2).
  
  3. 088 VistA MR 010710 - Reactivated clinics (those inactivated and 
     later reactivated) are now available for selection in VBECS. 
  
  4. 089 VistA MR 011310 - Class III and vendor supplied code causes 
     the VBECS ADT-A08 Router subscriber to the VAFC ADT-A08 SERVER 
     protocol to produce an error if the Class III or vendor supplied 
     code doesn't properly maintain the HL array. An additional call 
     to initialize the HL array is added to prevent the error.
  
  5. 090 VistA MR 020910 - VistA will no longer display an error 
     when processing the nightly workload reporting.
  
  6. 091 VistA MR 030910 - The REQ BLOOD KIND prompt will display 
     blood products for a patient Surgery event. Entering one or more 
     question marks at this prompt produces a list of available blood 
     product types entered for the patient.
  
  7. 098 VistA MR 070810 - The LRTASK NIGHTY process will processes 
     all workload and no longer cause a fatal error. 
  
  8. 101 VistA MR 092210 - Adding the "M" flag to the $$FIND1^DIC call 
     forces a multi-index lookup. This will force the call to search all
     available cross references for a match when looking up the Division
     during workload processing.
  
 There is also a VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 
 1.5.1.0 server update patch that is also being released. Please refer 
 to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 1.5.1.0 
 Release Notes for detailed information about corrections in that patch. 
 These documents will be found in the VBECS_1_5_1_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file.
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE: 
 =====================
  EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*1*10 contains 
  changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of

  does not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design 
  safeguards or safety critical elements functions.

 INSTALLATION INFORMATION:
 ==========================
  
 The file listed below is obtained via the controlled VBECS software 
 FTP. The installation of VBECS and its related patches are being 
 handled as a controlled release until all sites have installed. 
  
 Sites that have already installed VBECS in test or production must 
 obtain the VBEC*1.0*10, LR*5.2*401, and VBECS 1.5.1.0 patches from 
 the controlled VBECS software FTP site at: 
      IP: 10.3.21.76 
      Port: 20001 
  
      Enter your Domain and NT user name and password to gain access.
