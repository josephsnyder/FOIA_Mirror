Subject: Release of VBECS 1.5.2 Server Patch

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This information patch serves to alert VA facilities using the Vista 
 Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that the VBECS 1.5.2 
 server patch is available for immediate installation.
  
 If the VBECS servers are serviced by a second group, i.e. a Regional 
 Data Center, it is the responsibility of the local IRM support person 
 for VBECS to ensure that all parties who need to take action on this 
 information for 'their' VBECS system sees it. The local support should 
 follow local policies to forward such information to their Server 
 Administrators. 
  
 Sites who have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch is released with a forty-five (45) day compliance because the 
 patch addresses defects in system operation and includes performance 
 enhancements. A full description of patch changes are included in the 
 VBECS 1.5.2 Release Notes.
