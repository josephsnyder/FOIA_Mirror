Subject: MICROSOFT SQL SERVER SECURITY UPDATE FOR VBECS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch serves to alert VA facilities using the Vista Blood 
 Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that a Microsoft SQL Server
 Security Update is available for immediate installation.
  
 If the VBECS servers are supported by a second group, i.e. a Regional 
 Data Center, it is the responsibility of the local IRM support person 
 for VBECS to ensure that all parties who need to see this Update 
 Information for 'their' VBECS system sees it. The local support should 
 follow local policies to forward such information to their Server 
 Administrators. 
  
 Sites who have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch is released with a seven (7) day compliance because the 
 updates address security vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server. Failure 
 to comply with the installation of SQL Server Updates could expose the 
 VBECS servers and databases to security threats.
