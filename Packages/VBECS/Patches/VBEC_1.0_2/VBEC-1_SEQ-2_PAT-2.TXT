Subject: VBECS UPDATES REMINDER

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch serves as a reminder to VA facilities using the Vista Blood 
 Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that Microsoft Windows Updates 
 are available for immediate installation.
  
 Sites who have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch is released with a 7 day compliance because the updates 
 address security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. Failure to comply 
 with the installation of Windows Updates could expose the VBECS servers 
 and software to security threats.
  
 These Microsoft Windows Update patches were released on 7/14/09 and must 
 be installed on the VBECS servers:

 Windows Updates
 ===============
 If your servers are maintained at a data center, ignore this section 
 since data center personnel will install updates.
  
 The VBECS development team must test every Microsoft Windows update. Once 
 the development team is satisfied that the update causes no adverse 
 effects, Clinical Product Support (CPS) will give the sites permission to 
 apply the update by releasing this informational patch. 
  
 Updates are approved with Windows Server Update Service. Approved updates 
 will be downloaded to your servers automatically. However, a server 
 administrator must install the updates locally.
  
 Windows Update instructions:
 ============================
 1) Since most updates require a reboot, coordinate a time with the 
    Blood Bank manager to apply the updates. All Blood Bank users must 
    be logged off the VBECS server before updates can begin. 
  
 2) At the agreed upon down time, log on to the VBECS cluster server. 
  
 3) Use the Cluster Administrator Tool to verify which node is active 
    (Windows Updates should not be installed on an active node):
  
    a. Click on START, CONTROL PANEL, ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS, CLUSTER 
       ADMINISTRATOR.
    b. If the OPEN CONNECTION TO CLUSTER window appears, enter the 
       VBECS cluster name and click OK. 
    c. When Cluster Administrator has opened click on the folder titled 
       "Groups". 
    d. The server name listed on the right side under the Owner column 
       is the "Active" node.
    e. Record the server name listed under Owner, this is the active 
       node. The other server in the VBECS cluster is the passive node.
  
 4) Log on to the passive node of the VBECS cluster as a user with 
    server administrator privileges.
  
 5) Verify all users are off the VBECS server (do not proceed until all 
    Users are logged off):
  
    a. Click on START, CONTROL PANEL, ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS, double click 
       On TERMINAL SERVICE MANAGER. 
    b. Click on THIS COMPUTER. The users who are logged on to the server 
       will be displayed in the window pane on the right hand side under 
       the Users tab. 
    c. Right click on each user's name and click on SEND MESSAGE to send
       a message to the user asking them to log off the system.
    d. Close Terminal Service Manager.
  
 6) A yellow shield shaped icon will appear in the System Tray (lower 
    right corner of desktop) indicating updates are ready for 
    installation. Click on the shield icon in the System Tray. 
  
 7) Leave Express Install selected. Click INSTALL. 
  
 8) When the update process is complete, you may be prompted to reboot.
    Reboot the server at this time.
  
 9) Log on to the passive node that is now fully patched. Open the 
    Cluster Administrator tool and do the following: 
    a. Expand the Groups folder. Right click on CLUSTER GROUP, 
       select MOVE GROUP and wait until all the listed resources are 
       Online, this may take up to one minute. 
    b. Right click on GROUP 0, select MOVE GROUP and wait until all 
       the listed resources are Online, this may take up to one 
       minute. 
    c. Right Click on GROUP 1, select MOVE GROUP and wait until all 
       the listed resources are Online.
    d. Close Cluster Administrator.
  
 10) Log off the patched server which is now the active node.
  
 11) Log on to the other server and repeat steps 6-8.
