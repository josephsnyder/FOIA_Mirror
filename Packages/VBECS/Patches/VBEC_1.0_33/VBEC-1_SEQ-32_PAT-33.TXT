Subject: FIRMWARE UPDATE VERSION 9.30 FOR VBECS SERVERS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch serves to alert VA facilities using the Vista Blood 
 Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that a VBECS System Firmware 
 Update to Version 9.30 is available for immediate installation on the 
 VBECS servers.
  
 If the VBECS servers are supported by a second group, i.e. a Regional 
 Data Center, it is the responsibility of the local IRM support person 
 for VBECS to ensure that all parties who support the facilities VBECS 
 servers see this Update Information for 'their' VBECS system sees it. 
 The local support should follow local policies to forward such 
 information to their Server Administrators. 
  
 Sites that have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch is released with a fourteen (14) day compliance because the 
 updates address system diagnostics and hardware operation of the VBECS 
 servers. Failure to comply with the installation of the VBECS System 
 Firmware Update to Version 9.30 could lead to erroneous alert 
 messages, premature component failure and unnecessary downtime. Hewlett 
 Packard (HP) requires server firmware be up to date. Failure to update 
 the firmware could also lead to a delay in HP service support. 
  
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE 
 ===================== 
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*1.0*33 contains 
 changes to the deployed VBECS hardware. This patch does not alter or 
 modify any VBECS software design safeguards or safety critical elements 
 operation.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*1.0*33 have no effect on VBECS 
 functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 Firmware Version 9.30 Update 
 ============================ 
 VBECS is installed on HP ProLiant DL380 servers at the facility or 
 datacenter. Periodically HP releases a Firmware update for hardware to 
 optimize performance in the field. The VBECS development team created the 
 Firmware Version 9.30 package for the VBECS servers and verified there 
 are no adverse effects to VBECS. Clinical Product Support (CPS) will give 
 the sites permission to apply the update by releasing this 
 informational patch.
