 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*2*5 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*2*5 have no effect on VistA 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
 ========================
 The VBECS 2.3.2 Rev A server patch requires customer validation in the 
 local Test account prior to installation in Production to meet Food & 
 Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank 
 software for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for patient 
 care. 
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that the AITC coordinate the installation of 
 the VBECS 2.3.2 Rev A server patch with Pathology & Laboratory Medicine 
 Service staff to allow adequate time for impact analysis and testing the 
 changes prior to installation in Production. The VBECS 2.3.2 Release 
 Notes contain descriptions of the changes made in this patch and includes 
 validation scenarios.
