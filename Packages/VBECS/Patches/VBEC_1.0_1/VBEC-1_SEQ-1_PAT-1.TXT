  Installation Information:
 ==========================
  
 VBEC*1*1 is being exported as part of the VBECS package release.  The 
 installation of VBEC*1*1 will be controlled by phase a phased release.  
 An Implementation Manager will be assigned to your site and will contact 
 your POC for VBECS and will provide your site with the location of the 
 KIDS Host Files prior to your scheduled installation date. 
  
 Installation Sequence
 =====================
  
 The patches listed below represent those that will be part of the 
 controlled phased release.  Follow the sequence listed below when your 
 phased installation occurs.
  
   1. LR*5.2*335
   2. LR*5.2*367
   3. VBECS Bundle (consisting of VBEC*1*0 and LR*5.2*325)
   4. VBEC*1.0*1
   5. OR*3.0*212
  
  Installation File:
  
 VBEC_1_1.KID 
 The VBEC_1_1.KID file will be made available by the Implementation 
 Manager prior to your site's implementation schedule along with 
 instruction to retrieve. 
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Although this is a controlled, phased released, the user & technical 
 documentation will be available to all sites when the patch is officially 
 released and the phased implementations start.  This will allow sites the 
 opportunity to retrieve the documents before their phased installation 
 date
  
  
 Documentation is available for the VBECS package on the 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of 
 Information (OI) Field Offices. Sites will be able to utilize
 Documentation in either the ".PDF" or "DOC" format after they extract the
 ZIP file.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
 Download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
 specific server as follows:
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 NOTE:  The ZIP file listed below will be listed in each of the 
 VBECS and LR patches that are part of the VBECS package and associate 
 patches, it only needs to be downloaded once.

 VBECS_1_4_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP                   BINARY
  
  
  
 The following files are contained in the VBECS_1_4_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file 
 and will not be individually located on the OI Field Office Anonymous 
 Directories.
