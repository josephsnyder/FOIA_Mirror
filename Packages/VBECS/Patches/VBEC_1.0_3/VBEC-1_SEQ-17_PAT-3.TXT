Subject: VBEC Namespace updates

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VBEC*1.0*3 is exported as part of the VistA Blood Establishment 
 Computer System (VBECS) Version 1.5.0.0 release.
  
 The VBEC*1.0*3 patch addresses these issues: 
  
  1. Update the file location for CPT codes as required by the 
     anticipated release of patches ICD*18.0*40 and ICPT*6.0*46. 
  
      Test Case: Verify that HCPCS codes are available for use in VBECS 
      Log into VBECS and go to TOOLS, BLOOD PRODUCTS, select any blood 
      Product type and verify that the HCPCS Code list is populated.
  
  2. Remove the restriction on read access to the VBECS DSS EXTRACT 
     file (#6002.03). There are no test cases for this update. 
  
  3. Improved error message reporting for the VistA VistALink listener 
  
      Test Case: Users can disconnect VistALink from VBECS and place 
      an order or open the Blood Bank Report in CPRS. This message will 
      display: "Unable to retrieve patient information at this time, 
      please contact the Blood Bank. [restart VBECS VistALink listener]" 
  
  4. Corrects the problem that a Rh test result entered as "ND" (not 
     done) in VistA Blood Bank will display as "Neg" in CPRS Blood 
     Bank report. 
  
      Test Case: Users can verify this update by entering a Rh test as 
      ND and verifying that result appears as ND in the CPRS Blood 
      Bank Report. 
  
  5. Adds operating room locations to the VistA Hospital Locations Remote 
     Procedure Call. This will allow operating room locations 
     established at a site to appear in VBECS as an issue to location. 
  
      Test Case: Users can verify this update by issuing a unit and 
      selecting an operating room location. 
  
 There is also a VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 
 1.5.0.0 server update patch that is also being released. Please refer 
 to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 1.5.0.0 
 Release Notes for detailed information about corrections in that patch. 
 These documents will be found in the VBECS_1_5_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file.
