Subject: APRIL 2011 WINDOWS UPDATES FOR VBECS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch serves to alert VA facilities using the Vista Blood 
 Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that Microsoft Windows Updates 
 are available for immediate installation.
  
 If the VBECS servers are serviced by a second group, i.e. a Regional 
 Data Center, it is the responsibility of the local IRM support person 
 for VBECS to ensure that all parties who need to see this Update 
 Information for 'their' VBECS system sees it. The local support should 
 follow local policies to forward such information to their Server 
 Administrators. 
  
 Sites who have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch is released with a seven (7) day compliance because the 
 updates address security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. Failure 
 to comply with the installation of Windows Updates could expose the 
 VBECS servers and software to security threats. 
  
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE 
 ===================== 
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*1.0*26 contains

 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 Windows Updates 
 ================ 
 If your servers are maintained at a data center, ignore this section 
 since data center personnel will install updates.
  
 These Microsoft Windows Update patches were released on 04/13/11 and must 
 be installed on the VBECS servers*: 
  
      Internet Explorer 7
      KB2485663
      KB2508429
      KB2506212

      KB890830**
  
   *Note: Your server(s) may not request all of these updates. As long 
          as you've followed the instructions detailed below, this is 
          acceptable. 
  
  **Note: Windows Update KB890830 is a malicious software removal tool 
          and does not appear in the list of applied patches after 
          installation. 
  
 The VBECS development team must test every Microsoft Windows update. Once 
 the development team is satisfied that the update causes no adverse 
 effects, Clinical Product Support (CPS) will give the sites permission to 
 apply the update by releasing this informational patch. 
  
 Updates are approved with Windows Server Update Service. Approved updates 
 will be downloaded to your servers automatically. However, a server 
 administrator must install the updates locally.
  
 Windows Update instructions:
 ============================
  
 1) Since most updates require a reboot, coordinate a time with the 
    Blood Bank manager to apply the updates. All Blood Bank users must 
    be logged off the VBECS server before updates can begin. 
  
    Note: This month, we are deploying Internet Explorer 7 (IE7). 
          After IE7 is installed, the system will require reapplication 
          of previously released updates. After the initial update and 
          reboot, log on again. If the update shield doesn't prompt 
          with additional updates, execute the WUAUCLT /DETECTNOW command.
          Install subsequent updates until no more are available. 
  
 2) At the agreed upon down time, log on to the VBECS cluster as a user 
    with server administrator privileges. 
  
 3) Use the Cluster Administrator Tool to verify which node is active 
    (Windows Updates should not be installed on an active node):
  
    a. Click on START, CONTROL PANEL, ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS, CLUSTER 
       ADMINISTRATOR. 
    b. If the OPEN CONNECTION TO CLUSTER window appears, enter the 
       VBECS cluster name and click OK. 
    c. When Cluster Administrator has opened click on the folder titled 
       "Groups". 
    d. The server name listed on the right side under the Owner column 
       is the "Active" node.
    e. Record the server name listed under Owner, this is the active 
       node. The other server in the VBECS cluster is the passive node.
    f. Log off of the VBECS cluster server once the server name of the 
       active node is determined. 
  
 4) Log on to the passive node of the VBECS cluster as a user with 
    server administrator privileges. 
  
 5) Verify all users (other than the user installing the Windows updates) 
    are off the VBECS server (do not proceed until all users are logged 
    off):
  
    a. Click on START, CONTROL PANEL, ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS, double click 
       on TERMINAL SERVICE MANAGER. 
    b. Click on THIS COMPUTER. The users who are logged on to the server 
       will be displayed in the window pane on the right hand side under 
       the Users tab. 
    c. Right click on each user's name and click on SEND MESSAGE to send 
       a message to the user asking them to log off the system. 
    d. Close Terminal Service Manager.
    e. Do not proceed with installation until all users have logged off 
       the server. 
  
 6) A yellow shield shaped icon should appear in the System Tray (lower 
    right corner of desktop) indicating updates are available and ready 
    for installation. 
  
 7) If the yellow shield shaped icon fails to appear after waiting one 
    minute, perform the following steps: 
  
    a. Click on START, RUN. 
    b. Type CMD in the RUN window and press ENTER to open a command 
       shell. 
    c. Type WUAUCLT /DETECTNOW at the command prompt and press ENTER. 
    d. Close the command shell.
    e. The yellow shield shaped icon can take up to 30 minutes to appear 
       after entering the WUAUCLT /DETECTNOW command. 
    f. If the icon does not appear after 30 minutes, contact the VA 
       Service Desk (VASD)or file a Remedy ticket. 
  
 8) Click on the yellow shield shaped icon in the System Tray. 
  
 9) Leave Express Install selected. Click INSTALL. 
  
 10)When the update process is complete, you may be prompted to reboot. 
    Reboot the server at this time. 
  
 11)Log back on to the same server and install any remaining updates 
    by repeating steps 6-10. Only stop when there are no additional 
    updates.
  
 12)After the reboot is completed (this may take several minutes), log 
    on to the passive node that is now fully patched. Open the Cluster 
    Administrator tool and do the following: 
  
    a. Expand the Groups folder. Right click on each active group, select 
       MOVE GROUP and wait until all of the listed groups are Online, this 
       may take up to one minute per group.
    b. Examine the Resources folder. All resources should be owned by the 
       system that has just been patched (making it the active node).
    c. Close Cluster Administrator.
  
 13)Log off the patched server which is now the active node.
  
 14)Log on to the other server and repeat steps 5-10.
  
 15)At this point, if the Server Windows Update process is complete and 
    there are no outstanding issues, notify the Blood Bank Manager that 
    the VBECS system is once again available for use. If any issues are 
    encountered, contact the VA Service Desk (VASD)or file a Remedy 
    ticket.
