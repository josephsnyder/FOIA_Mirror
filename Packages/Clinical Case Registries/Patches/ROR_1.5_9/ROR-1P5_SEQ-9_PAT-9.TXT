Subject: CORRECT AIDS OI CHECKBOX ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the issue that occurs when the Center for 
 Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) form is saved on an HIV patient in
 the Clinical Case Registries GUI.  Data is being inappropriately populated
 in two fields located in the ROR HIV RECORD FILE (#799.4).
 The two fields that are being populated are: 
 CLINICAL AIDS (#.02) 
 CLINICAL AIDS DATE (#.03) 
 These fields should only be automatically populated when an AIDS Indicator
 Disease is specified in Section VIII of the CDC form.  
 Inadvertently populating  this data triggers the checkbox in the GUI to be
 checked which signifies that the patient has an AIDS Indicator 
 Disease.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================     
 HD0000000319731 - Checkbox becomes checked
      
       
 Problem :
 ---------
 The AIDS OI checkbox is, at times, being checked to denote a patient has
 an AIDS Indicator Disease.  The process to automatically check this box is
 based on data being populated in the fields CLINICAL AIDS (#.02) and
 CLINICAL AIDS DATE (#.03) in the ROR HIV RECORD FILE (#799.4).  This data
 is currently being populated when the CDC form is saved.  It should only
 populate this data if an AIDS Indicator Disease is specified in section
 VIII of the CDC form. 
                  
 Resolution :
 ------------
 Remove the additional code in routine RORRP027 that is setting the 
 data unconditionally.  There is a current trigger in place to 
 populate the data correctly in the ROR HIV RECORD FILE.
