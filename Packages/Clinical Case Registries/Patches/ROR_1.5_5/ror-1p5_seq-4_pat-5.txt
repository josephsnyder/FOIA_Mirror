Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues:

 sent to the AAC. (National Database)  The encounter
 provider is an optional field and should not prevent CPT from
 being sent.
      
 #2 One additional drug has been identified as being 
 needed for the nightly ROR registry update and data extraction.

 ------- 
 One Generic drug has been identified as needing to be added to

 ----------
 The drug listed above will be added to the ROR GENERIC
