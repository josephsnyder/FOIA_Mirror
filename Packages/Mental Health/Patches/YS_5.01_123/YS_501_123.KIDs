"BLD",9473,1,2,0)
makes the following changes for Mental Health Assistant (MHA).
"BLD",9473,1,3,0)
 
"BLD",9473,1,4,0)
MHA is moving the scoring logic for instruments from the YS_MHA_AUX.dll 
"BLD",9473,1,5,0)
to the M server side.  This patch converts the following instruments  
"BLD",9473,1,6,0)
from scoring in the DLL to M: AUDC, BAI, BAM-C, BAM-R, BASIS-24, BDI2, 
"BLD",9473,1,7,0)
BHS, BSS (formerly BSI), CDR, CEMI, FAST, ISMI, MINICOG, MMPI-2-RF,
"BLD",9473,1,8,0)
NEOP-I-3, PC PTSD, PHQ-2, POQ, QOLI, STMS, VR-12, WHODAS 2, and WHYMPI.
"BLD",9473,1,9,0)
 
"BLD",9473,1,10,0)
MHA now stores scale scores for all instruments in the MH RESULTS file. 
"BLD",9473,1,11,0)
Additionally, should an instrument need to be rescored for any reason, 
"BLD",9473,1,12,0)
there has been functionality added to maintain an audit for previous 
"BLD",9473,1,13,0)
scores.
"BLD",9473,1,14,0)
 
"BLD",9473,1,15,0)
The BSI was renamed to the BSS.  Additional modifications were made
"BLD",9473,1,16,0)
and can be found in the patch.
"BLD",9473,1,17,0)
 
"BLD",9473,1,18,0)
The responses for Question 7 in the VR-12 were corrected.
"BLD",9473,1,19,0)
 
"BLD",9473,1,20,0)
The Progress Note was modified to remove extra linefeeds when multiple
"BLD",9473,1,21,0)
instruments were administered.
"BLD",9473,1,22,0)
 
"BLD",9473,1,23,0)
The "skip" question logic in the Administer one item at a time for an
"BLD",9473,1,24,0)
instrument was corrected.

See the patch description for more detailed information.  This build 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
makes the following changes for Mental Health Assistant (MHA).
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
MHA is moving the scoring logic for instruments from the YS_MHA_AUX.dll 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
to the M server side.  This patch converts the following instruments  
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
from scoring in the DLL to M: AUDC, BAI, BAM-C, BAM-R, BASIS-24, BDI2, 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
BHS, BSS (formerly BSI), CDR, CEMI, FAST, ISMI, MINICOG, MMPI-2-RF,
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
NEOP-I-3, PC PTSD, PHQ-2, POQ, QOLI, STMS, VR-12, WHODAS 2, and WHYMPI.
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
MHA now stores scale scores for all instruments in the MH RESULTS file. 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
Additionally, should an instrument need to be rescored for any reason, 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
there has been functionality added to maintain an audit for previous 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
scores.
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
The BSI was renamed to the BSS.  Additional modifications were made
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
and can be found in the patch.
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
The responses for Question 7 in the VR-12 were corrected.
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
The Progress Note was modified to remove extra linefeeds when multiple
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
instruments were administered.
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
 
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
The "skip" question logic in the Administer one item at a time for an
"PKG",166,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
instrument was corrected.
