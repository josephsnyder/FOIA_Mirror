Subject: National Clozapine Registry (NCR) Hot Fix version 1.0.0.4

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of Mental Health patch YS*5.01*159 is to provide 
 information regarding a hotfix for version 1.0.0.4 of the National 
 Clozapine Registry (NCR) graphical user interface (GUI).  The NCR is 
 maintained by the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC).  The 
 NCCC is responsible for VA's compliance with the clozapine Risk 
 Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which was mandated by the Food 
 and Drug Administration (FDA) for tracking clozapine patients.
  
 The NCR v1.0.0.4 GUI is only available to staff at the NCCC.  The 
 software for this hotfix will be hosted in the VA cloud servers.  No site 
 involvement is needed and there are no components added to VistA.  This 
 patch provides documentation of the changes made to this cloud-based 
 application. 
  
 The issues below are listed with their Team Foundation Server (TFS) and 
 Rational Tools identifiers (IDs).  In the issues listed below there are 
 references to the Structured Query Language (SQL) Server Reporting 
 Services (SSRS) which are used in the NCR architecture.
  
 Hotfix v1.0.0.4 addresses the following defects:
  
 Issue 1:
  Move NCCC ID Generation to Initial Form Save
  TFS ID: 1112 Rational ID: 1175295
  
 This fixes a problem where the NCCC ID was only created after the 
 application was "submitted".  The defect is fixed by moving the NCCC ID 
 generation to the initial form save, so that users can create a 
 placeholder application.
  
 Issue 2:
  Requestor Search - Return Parent and Child Facilities
  TFS IDs: 1120, 1099, 1073 Rational ID: 1175301
  
 This fixes a problem where stakeholders no longer wanted the search 
 restricted to a Prescriber's associated facilities, but to instead look 
 at associated facilities and any in the group of Parent and Satellite 
 Facilities for any associated Facility.  The defect is fixed by searching 
 on all Parent and Satellite Facilities for the selected associated 
 Facility. The user can then associate Prescribers from related Facilities 
 instead of only the ones directly associated to the Facility.
  
 Issue 3:
  Restore "Remove Patient" Prompt on Discontinue
  TFS ID: 1062 Rational ID: 1175313
  
 This fixes a problem where the reminder popup box needs to be shown when 
 a current and active treatment is set to be discontinued.  The defect is 
 fixed by enabling the display to show on status change of "active" to 
 "discontinued", so that the user is reminded to also check VistA and set 
 the patient's treatment status accordingly.
  
 Issue 4:
  Prescribers Search - Remove Facility Requirement
  TFS ID: 1096 Rational ID: 1175314
  
 This fixes a problem where the Prescribers index page was filtering 
 entries that had no associated Facility.  The defect is fixed by allowing 
 all Prescribers to display, so that newly entered, or otherwise 
 unassociated Prescribers, will be searchable.
  
 Issue 5:
  Fix Reports Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in Production
  TFS ID: 1100 Rational ID: 1175318
 This fixes a problem where the SSRS production instance is not currently 
 running and the displayed URL is incorrect.  The defect is fixed by 
 configuring the SSRS production instance to use the production database 
 so that the NCR application pulls the correct reporting URL from the 
 updated configuration file.
  
 Issue 6:
  Search Returns Inactive Providers 
  TFS ID: 1289
 This fixes a problem with the search for the listed Requestor of a 
 monitoring change. Stakeholders no longer wanted all Facilities 
 associated with the Prescriber to be part of the results.  The defect is 
 fixed by including the active flag in the filter, so that only facilities 
 which are associated and active are returned in the search.
  
 Issue 7:
  Stop Date Selection not Allowing Current Date
  TFS ID: 1388
 This fixes a problem where the Stop Date field was excluding "today" as a 
 clickable option.  The is fixed by changing the maximum date selection to 
 include "today".
  
  
 Issue 8:
  When Treatment Status is Changed back to Active, 
  Clear Stop Date and Stop Code
  TFS ID: 1407
  
 This fixes a problem where a "Discontinued" Treatment was changed to have 
 a Status of "Active", the old Stop Date and Stop Code would still be 
 set.  The Stop Date and Stop Code fields are now cleared when the status 
 is change from "Discontinued" to "Active", so that the Treatment does not 
 have erroneous values associated with it.
  
 Issue 9:
  Stop Date not Displaying for Discontinued Treatment
  TFS ID: 1407
 This fixes a problem where the Stop Date was not displaying for a 
 discontinued treatment.  The Stop Date will now be displayed.
  
 Issue 10:
  Update search help for Prescriber and Requestor Search to
  Display "Enter name or station ID"
  TFS ID: 1411
 This fixes an issue problem where different placeholder text was desired 
 by the stakeholders.  The text was changed to match the updated 
 requirements.
  
 Issue 11:
  Standardize Save messages for all forms
  TFS ID: 1410
 This fixes a problem where save messages were not consistent.  The save 
 message was changed to "The application has been saved successfully." so 
 that there is a consistent User eXperience (UX) across the website.
