  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  HD0000000300466 - MULTIPLE TEST ADMINISTRATIONS NOT SHOWING 
                    UP IN MHA3 GUI 
  Problem
  -------
  When multiple instruments are administered for the same encounter/visit 
  through the CPRS Clinical Reminder Dialog, only the result of the last 
  instrument is displayed in the MHA3 Instrument Results Review GUI.
  
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  This patch modifies the Mental Health software so that all 
  assessments/Tests that are administered through the CPRS GUI Clinical 
  Reminders Dialog will now display regardless of encounter/visit date.  
  Now, if a user should happen to administer one or more of the same test 
  and/or surveys for the same date, all results will populate and be 
  displayed in the MHA3 Instrument Results Review GUI.
