============

 DESCRIPTION: ***YS*5.01*85 needs to be installed prior to PXRM*2*6*******
  
 The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Action Agenda for implementing the 
 President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health recommendations regarding 
 the use of information technology to enhance the care of Mental Health patients
 states, "VHA should make the integration of MHA and HealtheVet Desktop (HeVD) 
 an explicit goal and should provide the OI with sufficient resources to 
 accomplish this goal in collaboration with the Mental Health Strategic 
 Healthcare Group (MHSHG) Informatics Section.  The integration should 
 eliminate the need for Mental Health clinicians to change applications.  
 Further, the integration should make appropriate Mental Health assessment 
 tools available to clinicians outside Mental Health (e.g., depression and 
 alcohol screening instruments should be made available to primary care 
 clinicians)."
  
 This revision of MHA creates a closer integration with CPRS, by placing the MHA
 GUI on the CPRS Tools Menu.  Additionally, functionality was created to allow 
 a site to place an individual instrument on the Tools menu, allowing widespread
 access to that specific instrument without having to issue the menu for the MHP
 to all clinicians.
  
 Additional functionality that strengthens the tie to the patient's medical 
 record is the creation of a progress note in CPRS when an instrument is 
 completed through MHA.
  
 Furthermore, MHA maintains and strengthens its ties to the Clinical Reminders 
 program, which allows for the presentation of specific instruments through 
 reminder dialogs to all clinicians who resolve reminders.
  
 Clinical reminders has also developed a new patch, PXRM*2.0*6 that allows 
 reminders to work with the new MHA file structure.   YS*5.01*85 should be 
 installed just before PXRM*2*6.  If YS*5.01*85 is installed without 
 PXRM*2*6, reminders will not be able to recognize MHA instruments 
 administered after the file structure changes with YS*5.01*85.
  
 Additionally, the files of the MHP have been restructured to initiate the 
 migration toward re-engineering and placing MHA as a component of HealtheVet 
 Desktop when it is implemented.
  
 To better meet the needs of clinicians and patients in different programs, 
 particularly non-traditional settings, MHA can now run in a standalone mode to
 administer instruments offline for later uploading to VistA.
  
 VistA Mental Health Assistant NEW features in MHA3:
 ---------------------------------------------------
 1.  Completely re-organized VistA Mental Health database files to 
     simplify migration to HDR. 
      
 2.  MHA3 must be invoked from the CPRS Tools menu, for interaction with 
     VistA and patient selection. Patient-selection is done entirely by
     interaction with CPRS. 
      
 3.  MHA3 can run in standalone mode, but only for administering offline 
     tests-which later must be uploaded to VistA.
   
 4.  MHA3 allows the CPRS Tools menu to invoke any number of single types 
     of instruments, without the need to go directly to the MHA3 Main form. For 
     instance, a CAGE menu item can be added to the Tools menu, which would 
     invoke only a CAGE data entry form. 
  
 5.  Major functionality (GAF, ASI, Results, etc.) is now presented on 
     individual forms, as opposed to as tabs on one main form. 
  
 6.  MHA3 now provides a new Battery Wizard form to simplify creating 
     batteries of instruments.
  
 7.  There is a new & improved SecureDesktop component that now uses stronger 
     code to prevent hacking. 
      
 8.  "Clerk entry" data-entry-mode form for psych tests has been removed. 
  
 9.  All completed administrations now automatically generate a progress note 
     for review in CPRS.
      
 10. All test scores are now saved in VistA, instead of calculated on-the-fly. 
  
 11. There is now a Hospital Location associated with an administered 
     instrument, for progress notes purposes. 
  
 12. The accompanying MHA3 help file is supplied only for describing the 
     functions of the ASI Manager forms. All other tests and interview have 
     built-in help that is retrieved directly from the MHP when using the 
     "Description" pop-up menu function in the Instrument Manager. 
  
 13. MHA3 now recreates a debug log file named "c:\documents and
     settings\username\application data\mha3\mha3_debug.log" for each MHA3
     session. This file can be emailed to developers to assist in remote 
     debugging. No patient-identifying data is collected in this file. 
  
  
 This patch contains 23 new Mental Health files, 58 new Mental Health
 Remote Procedures, 57 new Mental Health routines, 1 option, 2 Protocols, 
 1 HL7 application parameter and 1 HL logical link.
  
  
   23 New Mental Health files to be released in this patch:
   --------------------------------------------------------
   MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71)
   -----------------------------------
   This file defines the interviews, surveys and tests available in the Mental
   Health Assistant. Attributes of the instruments include authoring credits,
   target populations, normative samples and copyright information. Actions
   available including privileging, reporting of full item content and
   transmission to the Mental Health National Database are also specified. 
  
   Entries may be made through the provided Mental Health Authoring software. 
   Direct entry through Fileman or the programmer prompt is prohibited.
  
   MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72)
   ---------------------------
   This file contains a listing of all questions for all Psychological 
   Interviews, Surveys and Tests.  This allows usage of questions by multiple 
   instruments. Each question can also linked to an entry in the MH 
   INTRODUCTIONS file (#601.73), the MH CHOICES file (#601.75), the MH 
   CHOICETYPES file (#601.751) and the Hint field (#8) in the MH QUESTIONS 
   file (#601.72). 
  
   MH INTRODUCTIONS file (#601.73)
   -------------------------------
   This file contains the introductory information given at the beginning of 
   each instrument or at the beginning of a new section of an instrument. The 
   introduction text motivates, gives instructions and sets the frame for the 
   task the patient must complete. The same introduction text can be used by 
   multiple instruments.
  
   MH RESPONSE TYPES file (#601.74)
   --------------------------------
   This file contains what type of response from the user is required for a 
   question.  Response types contained in the file include MCHOICE (multiple 
   choice), Integers, Strings, Dates, Memos and Currency.  These entries are 
   pointed to the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72).
  
   MH CHOICES file (#601.75)
   -------------------------
   This file contains the individual selections possible in a multiple choice 
   question.  Examples are Yes or No, True or False, 1.  Abraham Lincoln, 2.
   George Washington, 3. George W. Bush or 4. Richard Nixon. For instruments 
   first defined in the legacy system MH INSTRUMENT file (#601), a single 
   character is specified for a multiple choice answer.  If George Washington 
   was the choice selected the legacy value would be 2.  
  
   Choices are pointed to by the MH CHOICETYPES file (#601.751) which is a 
   collection of choices.  Choices are referenced in the MH ANSWERS file 
   (#601.85) as a pointer to the full response.
  
   MH CHOICETYPES file (#601.751)
   ------------------------------
   This file contains a collection of choices from MH CHOICES file (#601.75) 
   and their display sequence.  This allows sets of choices to be specified by 
   the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72).  An example of an entry would be: 1. True 
   2. False 3. Undecided  Each multiple choice question must specify a 
   ChoiceType. In this way a ChoiceType can be used by multiple instruments 
   and multiple questions.
  
   MH INSTRUMENT CONTENT file (#601.76)
   ------------------------------------
   This file specifies which entries from the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72) are 
   parts of which instrument in the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71).  It is 
   the "table of contents" for an interview, survey or test. Also specified are 
   the sequence of questions and display attributes for the introductions, 
   questions and choices.  Display attributes can be bold, underlined and font
   size for the introductions, questions and choices.
  
   MH BATTERIES file (#601.77)
   ---------------------------
   This file contains a list of interview, survey and test order sets.
  
   MH BATTERY CONTENTS file (#601.78)
   ----------------------------------
   Ties the entries in the MH BATTERY CONTENTS file (#601.78) to the 
   instruments in the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71). 
  
   MH BATTERY USERS file (#601.781)
   --------------------------------
   This file contains a list of all interviews, surveys and tests associated 
   with an entry in the MH BATTERIES file (#601.77).  The order of presentation 
   of the interviews, surveys and tests within a battery and which battery 
   belongs to which user in the NEW PERSON file (#200) is also specified.
  
   MH SKIPPED QUESTIONS file (#601.79)
   -----------------------------------
   This file specifies the questions to be skipped (by question IEN) if a rule 
   is met for a given question in a given instrument.
  
   MH SECTIONS file (#601.81)
   --------------------------
   This file specifies sections within an interview, survey and test. The first 
   MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72) is specified along with captions (tab and 
   overall). Display characteristics can also be set.
  
   MH RULES file (#601.82)
   -----------------------
   This file contains the rules used in administering an interview, survey or 
   test. A rule is an action that is performed when a specified question is 
   answered in a specified manner. An example of a rule would be to enter 'Not
   applicable' to the Question, "Are you pregnant?" if the patient has had a
   hysterectomy. Rules are complex logic based entries that enables the user to
   create complex scripts.
  
   MH INSTRUMENTRULES file (#601.83)
   ---------------------------------
   This file ties together an instrument in the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file 
   (#601.71), a question in the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72) and a rule in the 
   MH RULES file (#601.82). This allows a rule to be used in multiple 
   instruments and for different questions.
  
   MH ADMINISTRATIONS file (#601.84)
   ---------------------------------
   The MH ADMINISTRATIONS file (#601.84) contains the data collected during 
   the administration of a specified instrument from the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS 
   file (#601.71) given to a patient at a specific date and time. For each 
   administration of a specified instrument from the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file 
   (#601.71) there will be an entry in this file. 
  
   An entry in this file does not store the results of the instrument's 
   administration but is an index to the instrument's administration. The entry 
   indicates whether the instrument has been completed, who ordered the 
   instrument, how many questions were answered and if the test has been 
   electronically signed.
  
   MH ANSWERS file (#601.85)
   -------------------------
   When a patient answers a question, the results are stored in this file. An 
   entry for each question answered, in each administration is stored. Each 
   entry  has an MH ADMINISTRATON ID field(#.01) of the MH ADMINISTRATION file 
   (#601.84), a Question NUMBER field (#.01) of the MH QUESTIONS file (601.72) 
   and the response.
  
   MH SCALEGROUPS file (#601.86)
   -----------------------------
   ScaleGroups are collections of MH SCALES file (#601.87) that are logically 
   displayed together. Information needed to graph the scales are stored here.
   This includes the ordinate title, minimum and maximum values, graph 
   increments and grid lines.  
  
   All scales need to be associated with a MH SCALEGROUP to be displayed. MH 
   SCALEGROUPS file (#601.86) and MH SCALES file (#601.87) allow multiple 
   scoring possibilities within a single instrument.
  
   MH SCALES file (#601.87)
   ------------------------
   A MH SCALE is one dimension of measurement in an instrument. An example may 
   simply be a TOTAL as in a spelling test or multiple scales in a personality 
   disorder instrument (depression, anxiety, thought disorder etc.). Each scale 
   has at least one associated entry in the MH SCALEGROUP file (#601.86) and an 
   entry in the MH SCORING KEYS file (#601.91).
  
   MH DISPLAY file (#601.88)
   -------------------------
   This file contains the entries to set the Windows display attributes for 
   the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72), MH INTRODUCTIONS file (#601.73) and the 
   MH RESPONSE TYPES file (#601.74). Windows display attributes include fonts, 
   bolding, underline, colors and columns.
  
   MH CHOICEIDENTIFIERS file (#601.89)
   -----------------------------------
   This file specifies the displayed numeric options that go along with a 
   multiple choice item.  Choice type identifiers can be numbered starting from 
   one, from zero or remain unnumbered.
  
   MH SCORING KEYS file (#601.91)
   ------------------------------
   This file contains the scoring keys.  The scoring keys are the "answer 
   sheet" for the specified scale entry in the MH SCALES file (#601.87).  When 
   an answer the matches the Target value (ie, is correct) a specified value is 
   added to the score.  An example would be: if the question is "How much is 5 
   plus 3", the target value would be 8 and 10 points would be added to the 
   total score (grade) in a ten question test to make a possible score of 1
  
   MH RESULTS file(#601.92)
   ______________________________
   This file contains results of the scored output of completed
   instruments.
   
   MH REPORT file (#601.93)
   ------------------------------
   This file contains the reporting format for a specified instrument. Input
   into this file must be entered only through the Mental Health Editor software
 .

    Installation Instructions:
    ==========================
    1. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the PackMan menu. The
       Host File name is YS_501_85.KID.  Answer YES to the question:
       "Want to Continue with Load? YES//"
  
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to install the Transport global. 
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
       following options:
  
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Backup a Transport Global
  
  
    3. Users may remain on the system, but installation should be done 
       at off peak hours.  During testing, it was noted that if a user had 
       a reminder dialog open when the install took place, the reminder
       dialog would not load and work properly until CPRS was logged off.
  
    4. Installation will take less than five minutes. 
  
    5. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
       'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'YS*5.01*85'
       and proceed with install.
   
    6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
       install//', respond NO.
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? YES//', respond NO
   
    7. Place the MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANT VERSION 3 USER MANUAL in a
       location that can be accessed by MHA users.
  
    8. Please refer to the INSTALL WINDOWS ILLUSTRATION  section of the 
       MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANT VERSION 3 INSTALLATION GUIDE to install
       the MHA software.
  
    9. The Secure Desktop feature in the MHA software is a security 
       feature that locks down computers when patients are completing 
       assessments directly in MHA.  Because it locks down all other 
       applications on the computer when activated, it must be loaded
       directly on the PC where it will be used.  It should only be loaded
       on machines that will be used for patient administered
       assessments.  It should not be pushed out to all machines on the
       network.  More detailed information is found in the MHA VERSION 3
       INSTALLATION GUIDE.
  
    10. Place the option YS BROKER1 [YS BROKER1] on the Mental Health 
       users secondary menu. Consider adding this option to all users that 
       have the menu option OR CPRS GUI CHART in support of PXRM*2*6 
  
    11. Enter appropriate members into the Mail Group YS MHA-MHNDB to
       the system, but installation should be done at off peak hours.
  
    12. Place the MHA application on the CPRS Tools menu.
  
    13. Create progress note title of "Mental Health Diagnostic Study 
        Note" in the progress note hierarchy.  This is needed for MHA to 
        automatically pass a note to CPRS from instrument administrations 
        completed within MHA.
  
    14. A new entry is created in File 771, the HL7 Application Parameter
        File: YS MHA.  It is exported as Inactive and should be set to
        Active after install.
  
    15. A new entry is also created in File 870, the HL Logical Link file.
        This entry is YS MHAT. The logical link named YS MHAT is used by
        the HL7 package to send VistA ADT HL7 messages containing patient
        demographics, patient administration and patient answers.
