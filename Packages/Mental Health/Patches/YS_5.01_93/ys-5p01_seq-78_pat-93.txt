Subject: TURN OFF HL7 MESSAGE GENERATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  This patch is intended to prevent the generation of HL7 messages to the 
  YS MHAT Logical Link within the Mental Health package.
  
 With the installation of patch YS*5.01*93 the HL7 Mental Health messages 
 will no longer be generated. Patch YS*5.01*93 will not delete or change 
 the status on the HL7 Mental Health messages that have already been 
 generated and not sent. If you have the HL PURGE TRANSMISSIONS 
 background job queued to run, these messages will be deleted within the
 number of days set in the  PURGE ALL MESSAGES field of the HL
 COMMUNICATION SERVER PARAMETERS file. If sites have any questions in
 regards to these HL parameters, please input a remedy ticket to HL7 1.6.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
  Problem: 
  ========
  With the release of the Mental Health Assistant 3 patch YS*5.01*85, it 
  was the intention of the developers to release this with HL7 messaging 
  disabled.  Unfortunately, messaging was enabled and now the transmission
  of these messages to the Mental Health National Database (MH-NDB) is 
  failing.  This is resulting in unsent messages building up in the YS MHAT
  Logical link, even if it is turned off.
   
  Resolution:
  ===========
  The generation of HL7 messages to the queue will be turned off by
  commenting out the line of code DIRECT+1^YTQHL7.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
    
  The revised MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANT VERSION 3 (MHA3)INSTALLATION GUIDE
  manuals are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories at one of 
  the following Office of Information (OI) Field  Offices. These files 
  need to be retrieved in binary format.
     
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the 
      first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
        Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
      The documentation distribution includes:
