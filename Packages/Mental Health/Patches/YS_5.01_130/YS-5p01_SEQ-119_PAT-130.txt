Subject: MHA WEB PATIENT ENTRY

Category:

  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to enable patients to enter mental health
 assessments themselves via a new web application.  There is no longer a
 need to use Secure Desktop for patient entered assessments (and Secure
 Desktop does not function with Windows 10). When "Instrument
 Administration" is used in the Mental Health Assistant (MHA) client
 application, clicking the "Patient Entry" button will now display a
 five-digit number rather than activate the secure desktop. This number is
 entered at a kiosk or on an iPad to bring up the assigned assessment(s)
 for a patient.
  
 The kiosk workstations and iPads will need to be configured for operation 
 at each facility.  For additional information about configuring these
 devices see the MHA3 Installation Guide (YS*5.01*130).

 Installation:
 ============= 
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be installed when user activity is low. Installation time will be
 less than 5 minutes.
   
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
 2.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
     [XPD MAIN]: 
   
          Edits and Distribution ...  
          Utilities ...  
          Installation ...  
   
     Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
          1      Load a Distribution
          2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          3      Print Transport Global
          4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
          5      Backup a Transport Global
          6      Install Package(s)
                 Restart Install of Package(s)
                 Unload a Distribution
   
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter YS*5.01*130):
       
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
         patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
   
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     YS*5.01*130.
  
     a.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion
         of Install? NO//", answer NO.
     b.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
         install? NO//", answer NO.

         Options and Protocols? NO//", answer NO.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 After the KIDS build for YS*5.01*130 is installed, the existing MHA
 executable (1.0.3.75) and the new MHA executable (1.0.3.80) will both
 still function.  A simultaneous update of the Windows executable is not
 required.  This provides the option of having some users continue with the
 existing executable while others (perhaps those with access to iPads or
 kiosks) use the new executable. Adding another MHA item to the CPRS Tools
 menu can accomplish this.  These are the basic steps:
  
  o  Rename the new "YS_MHA.exe" to something like "YS_MHA_130.exe" and
     place it in the directory where you currently have YS_MHA.exe.
  o  Edit the parameter, ORWT TOOLS MENU, and add another item named
     something like "MHA Patient Entry" that invokes the executable that
     you just renamed.
  o  When you are ready for all users to use the new executable, simply
     delete the YS_MHA.exe file and rename "YS_MHA_130.exe" to
     "YS_MHA.exe".  Don't forget to remove the temporary item from the 
     ORWT TOOLS MENU.
  
 If your site's workstations are all Windows 10 and you are not using 
 "Secure Desktop" with MHA anymore, you can just move to the new YS_MHA.exe
 immediately, without adding a new item to the CPRS Tools menu.
