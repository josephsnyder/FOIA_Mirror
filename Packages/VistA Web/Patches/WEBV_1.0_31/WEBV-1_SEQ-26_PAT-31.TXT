 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) INC000000934827 - Add a new location from which VistAWeb will pull 
    'Immunization Name' data
    
    Problem:
    ========
    VistAWeb does not find data for the 'Immunization Name' column of the
    'Immunization' section located in Patient Summary Report. This data is
    located in a different XML location than the XML location VistAWeb
    looks in.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Update VistAWeb code so that it goes to new location that data for 
    'Immunization Name' column is sent in.
  
 2) INC000000937678 - Incorrect display of 'Source' column in 'Allergy' and
    'Problem' sections
    
    Problem:
    ========
    VistAWeb does not find data for the 'Source' column of the 'Allergy'
    and 'Problem List' sections located in Patient Summary Report. This
    data is located in different XML locations than the XML locations
    VistAWeb looks in.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Update VistAWeb code so that it goes to the new location where data for
    the 'Source' column is sent.
  
 3) INC000000937819 - Incorrect display of 'Provider' column in 'Problem'
    section
    
    Problem:
    ========
    VistAWeb does not find data for the 'Provider Name' column of the 
    'Problems List' section located in the Patient Summary Report. This 
    data is located in a different XML location than the XML location 
    VistAWeb looks in.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Update VistAWeb code so that it goes to the new location where data for
    'Provider Name' column is sent.
  
 4) INC000000938564 - Update page text from 'NwHIN Documents' to 
    'Non-VA Health Summaries'
    
    Problem:
    ========
    The term 'NwHIN' (Nationwide Health Information Network) is no longer
    in use, therefore the wording needs to change.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Update text to say 'Non-VA Health Summaries'.
  
 5) INC000000891067 - Populate 'Provider' column of 'Problem' section with
    provider name from Healthcare Provider module
    
    Problem:
    ========
    VistAWeb does not find data for the 'Provider Name' column of the 
    'Problems List' section located in the Patient Summary Report. This 
    data is located in a different XML location than the  XML location 
    VistAWeb looks in.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Update VistAWeb code so that it looks for data in the new location 
    where data for the 'Provider Name' column is sent.
  
 6) INC000000883111 - In 'Lab Results' section, do not display '--' for
    individual results, leave the table cell blank
    
    Problem:
    ========
    VistAWeb displays '--' in the 'Lab Results' section next to each  
    individual lab performed in the 'Date/Time' column. This column will
    always be empty because 'Date/Time' will be displayed in the main row
    for the lab and individual lab work done doesn't need individual '--'s
    and can be completely empty.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Update VistAWeb code to not show '--' in the 'Date/Time' column of the
    individual lab.
