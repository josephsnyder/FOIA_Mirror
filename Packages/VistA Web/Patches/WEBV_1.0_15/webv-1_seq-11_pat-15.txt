 The primary VistAWeb server will be changing from Silver Spring, MD to
 Falling Waters, WV.  This is currently planned to be sometime after
 October 1, 2008.
  
 As part of the preparation for this move, this patch is being sent out
 to update the REMOTE APPLICATION file, 8994.5.  Please read the DATA
 DICTIONARY description of this file for more information.
  
 This patch contains a single routine, which is a post install routine that
 is automatically executed after patch installation.  This routine simply
 adds one entry (VISTAWEB-FW) to the REMOTE APPLICATION file, which is the 
 Broker Security Enhancement entry for the new Falling Waters VistAWeb
 server address.
  
 After patch installation, there will be 2 entries for VISTAWEB in this file.
 Please DO NOT remove the old VISTAWEB entry from this file.  This old entry
 will be dealt with nation-wide by the VistAWeb team following the
 retirement of the hardware at Silver Spring.

 MANUAL POST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 =================================
 Please perform the following manual step after this patch is installed.
  
 This patch also inserts a package entry for VISTA WEB in the PACKAGE file.
 This manual step is necessary because this is the first time that a 
 VISTA WEB M routine is being sent to the field.  Populating the CURRENT
 VERSION field should avoid warning messages about VISTA WEB version mis-
 matches in future VISTA WEB releases of M routines.
  
 These steps should take less than two minutes.
  
  1. Change the CURRENT VERSION field of the PACKAGE file entry for 
     VISTA WEB to 1
  
     (a) From the Systems Manager Menu, select "FileMan" (FM)
  
     (b) From the FileMan menu, select "Enter or Edit" (EN)
  
     (c) At the "INPUT TO WHAT FILE" prompt, enter PACKAGE
  
     (d) At the "EDIT WHICH FIELD" prompt, enter CURRENT VERSION
  
     (e) At the "THEN EDIT FIELD" prompt, press Enter
  
     (f) At the "Select PACKAGE NAME" prompt, enter VISTA WEB (you must include
         the space between the words VISTA and WEB)
  
     (g) At the "CURRENT VERSION" prompt, enter 1 (the number "1")
  
  2. Using FileMan "Inquire to File Entries", verify that the PACKAGE file 
     entry for VISTA WEB contains a CURRENT VERSION field with the number 1 
  
     You should see something like the following:
  
      NAME: VISTA WEB                      PREFIX: WEBV
        SHORT DESCRIPTION: VISTA WEB
      VERSION: 1.0
