 in the Immunization section of the Patient Summary Report.
 4) Renamed column "OCF" to "OFC" in Vitals section of the Patient Summary 
 Report, which stands for Occipital Frontal Circumference.

 in Information Security Program (CRISP) security issues.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) INC000000809508 - VistAWeb stylesheet updates for Indiana
  
    Problem:
    ========
    For IHIE, VistAWeb could not find data located in Patient Summary 
    Report because it was in a different part of the VW code than the 
    part of the code VistAWeb looks in.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Update WV code so that VistAWeb looks in the correct part of the 
    code where IHIE sends data.
  
 2) INC000000892418 - VistAWeb is not displaying lab result interpretation 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    For Hawaii, VistAWeb does not display data in the interpretation 
    section of the lab results in the Patient Summary Report when the
    entry in the interpretation field is only one character in length.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Update VistAWeb code to show the interpretation regardless of length.
  
 3) INC000000881534 - Analyze VistAWeb stylesheets
  
    Problem:
    ========
    VistAWeb doesn't display data in the Immunizations field of the
    Patient Summary Report when the data is only one character long.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Update VistAWeb code so that it returns data that is one character
    long.
  
 4) INC000000881616 - Rename 'OCF' column in Vitals section to 'OFC'
  
    Problem:
    ========
    In the 'Vitals' section of Patient Summary Report there is a column
    called 'OCF.' This needs to be renamed to 'OFC,' which is head
    circumference. 
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Change column header wording from 'OCF' to 'OFC'.
  
 5) INC000000891070 - Invalid data displayed in allergy reaction field
  
    Problem:
    ========
    VistAWeb is displaying allergy severity in the allergy reaction 
    field when reaction isn't provided.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Instead of displaying allergy severity, VistAWeb will now display  
    '--', if there is no allergy reaction data available.
  
 6) INC000000891639 - Address VistAWeb security
  
    Problem:
    ========
    A security scan of VistAWeb revealed that there are a number of 
    potential security issues.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Change VistAWeb code to fix these issues:
    1) Autocomplete HTML Attribute Not Disabled for Password Field
    2) Missing Secure Attribute in Encrypted Session (SSL) Cookie
    3) Cacheable SSL Page Found
  
    Technical Description
    =====================
    The following items describe the three issues from the above.
    1) Autocomplete HTML Attribute Not Disabled for Password Field
    If the 'autocomplete' attribute is missing in the 'password'
    field of the 'input' element, add it and set it to 'off'.
  
    2) Missing Secure Attribute in Encrypted Session (SSL) Cookie
    Basically the only required attribute for the cookie is the
    'name' field. Common optional attributes are: 'comment',
    'domain', 'path', etc. The 'secure' attribute must be set
    accordingly in order to prevent the cookie from being sent
    unencrypted.
  
    3) Cacheable SSL Page Found
    Disable caching on all SSL pages or all pages that contain
    sensitive data. This can be achieved by using
    'CacheControl:nostore' and 'Pragma:nocache' response directives
    in your SSL page headers.
