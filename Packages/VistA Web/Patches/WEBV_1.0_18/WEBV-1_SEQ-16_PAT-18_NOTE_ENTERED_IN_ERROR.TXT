Entered in Error Description:
Version 12 of VistAWeb (patch WEBV*1*18) was  promoted to the VistaWeb 
production  server Monday night
 July 19, 2010, at 9 p.m. EST.
 
This version of VistaWeb did not include any new functionality for report 
retrieval,  however, it has produced a number of 
broker connection errors.  The Vista Web Developers have been analyzing 
the problem all morning and have recommended that 
we revert back to the previous version of Vista Web until the problem can 
be resolved. 
Therefore we have reverted back to VistaWeb version 11 until further 
notice.
