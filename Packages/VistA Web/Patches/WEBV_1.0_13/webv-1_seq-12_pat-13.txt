 VistAWeb V8.0 includes the following enhancements and fixes:
  
 1. Resolved PSP0-970 (Remedy #259376)- Inpatient Medications from a previous  
    VA inpatient stay may not display in Remote Data View (RDV) and 
    VistAWeb "Pharmacy - Medications" view of medications, depending on the 
    current VA patient status. 
    - Resolved PSI-07-009, PSPO #462 (Remedy ticket #174350) - Patient Name 
    Number Does Not Print.
    - Resolved PSI-07-242, PSPO #832 (Remedy ticket #217656) - BHIE DATA not
    populating in RDV and VistAWeb.
  
 2. Standard Printing
    - The print function has been removed from Internet Explorer (IE) and 
      put in VistAWeb.
    - A standard VistAWeb header appears on all printed reports, which 
      contains patient-identifying information on the first page.
    - The footer of printed pages will contain the name of the person who
      printed the report.
    - Line feeds will occur between documents, but not between pages.
  
    - The printouts may not print all of the columns of a grid report 
      depending on the formatting or the size of the browser window. A message 
      has been added to the print dialog window for grid reports and for
      grid report printouts, as follows: 
      ***WARNING: Printed grid reports may not show all columns.
      Check printouts carefully.***
  
 3.  FHIE to BHIE name change: The note at the bottom of the tree view will
     show a dagger symbol and say: Pages with BHIE data (Dept. of Defense)
  
 4.  VistAWeb will display Department of Defense data for Vitals.
  
 5.  The Problem List Report will display Department of Defense data.
  
 6.  The view details windows for Allergies and Outpatient Pharmacy have been
     fixed so that they will no longer be blank.
  
 7.  The special user access message has been changed to:
     "If you need to look up a patient who has not been seen at your VAMC 
      (remote site patient lookup), you must request Special User access to
      VistAWeb.  Ask for special user access by emailing the VHA CO CAPRI
      access team vhacocapri@va.gov."
  
 8.  The OOPS message has been changed to:
     "Oops
     An error has occurred.  If the problem persists please contact your
     local IRM/Computer support staff or log a ticket with the VA Service
     desk (VASD) at 1-888-596-4357.  Please provide the process you were 
     performing and the date/time the error occurred."
  
 9.  A fix has been included in v8 for the problem with multiple threads 
     locking up VistaWeb so that some data may not appear in Notes.
