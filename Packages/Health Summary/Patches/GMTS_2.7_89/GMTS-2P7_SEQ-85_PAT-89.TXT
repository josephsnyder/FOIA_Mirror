Description:
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 The build for this patch is distributed as part of a multi-package build that
 contains PXRM*2.0*12, GMTS*2.7*89, OR*3.0*295, and TIU*1.0*249.
 
 This patch contains an enhancement to Health Summary Objects. Sites will
 now be able to overwrite the "No Data Available" message in the TIU/HS Object
 if the Health Summary Type does not return any data. This was done by adding
 a new field, "OVERWRITE NO DATA," to the Health Summary Object file, file
 #142.5.
 
 To override the No Data Available Message, the Suppress Components without
 Data field must be set to "Yes" and text must be defined in the
 Overwrite No Data Available Message prompt.
 
 Two new national Health Summary Components are being released with 
 this patch.
 
 Clinical Reminders Findings
 Clinical Reminders Last Done
 
 Clinical Reminders Findings works like the Clinical Maintenance component.
 However, it only lists the name of the reminder and the findings evaluation
 for the reminder. It does not display the status line and it does not list
 the frequency line.
 
 Clinical Reminders Last Done components display the reminder name and the
 last done date, if the last done date is defined. If the last done date is
 unknown, the last done date will be blank.
 
 Neither of these components will list the header line:
 
 "--STATUS--  --DUE DATE--  --LAST DONE--"
 
 The output for the Health Summary Components PCE IMMUNIZATIONS and the
 PCE SKIN TESTS are changed in this patch. With this patch, if the name of
 the immunization exceeds 14 characters, the name will be truncated and a "*"
 will appear at the end of the truncated name. If the facility name exceeds
 10 characters, the name will also be truncated at 10 characters and an "*"
 will appear at the end of the name. Also the column has been changed to be
 left-justified instead of center-justified. The comments were moved more to
 the left and they begin with the word "Comments:".
 
 A new API (EN^GMTSDESC) has been created to display the definitions of 
  Health Summary Type, Health Summary Object, and a Health Summary Component
 in a readable output. This API was created to support Clinical Reminders in
 posting a description of a Health Summary Type and Health Summary Objects
 when packing up a reminder dialog that contains a TIU/HS Object.
