Subject: RESTRICT SENSITIVE DATA ON HEALTH SUMMARY PRINT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other

Description:
============

  Patients are often given printed Health Summaries for items such as a
  formatted list of medications.  Because these items are Health Summaries,
  they also contain a standard header which displays the patient's name,
  DOB, and full 9-digit SSN.
  
  Patients, not recognizing that such sensitive information is present,
  may improperly dispose of the list.  To help protect this sensitive 
  information, this patch adds a new field (SUPPRESS SENSITIVE PRINT 
  DATA) to the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE file (#142) to allow control over the
  level of information displayed on a hard copy print of a predefined
  health summary type.
  
  Depending on the value found in the new field, the SSN/DOB information 
  will be in one of the following formats:
   -Full 9 digit SSN and full DOB
   -4 digit SSN and No DOB
   -No SSN and No DOB
  
  Affected Functionality
  ========================
  Predefined health summary type printouts produced from CPRS GUI, List
  Manager, and print menus within the Health Summary package.

                           List Manager         SSN/DOB based on flag value
  
  
  Additionally, the display of a health summary object will be affected by 
  this patch. Information displayed from a health summary object is
  controlled by the choices made during object creation/modification and
  the underlying health summary type.  Unless otherwise suppressed during
  object creation/modification, health summary objects will respect the
  value of SUPPRESS SENSITIVE PRINT DATA found for each object's health 
  summary type.  This applies to viewing objects in electronic AND hard
  copy format.
  
  Usage note regarding List Manager:
  The patient information header in List Manager is separate from the 
  header found on health summary reports.  Any changes to the patient
  information header are outside the scope of this patch.  As a result, any
  hard copy print of a predefined health summary via the List Manager
  interface will still have viewable patient SSN and DOB data.
  
  Note - In an effort to address the urgency of this effort, Ad Hoc health
  summaries were excluded from this request.
