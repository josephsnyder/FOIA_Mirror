Description:

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Health Summary

 1.  Incorrect information is getting appended to the bottom of IMED 
     education notes when displayed with [SPN] (Selected progress notes) 
     Health Summary component. 
  
 2.  Health Summary components [VS] "Vital Signs", [VSD] "Vital Signs 
     Detailed Display", and [SVS] "Vital Signs Selected" are displaying 
     clinically incorrect information.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000418117 - Imed Consent note shows as unsigned
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem occurs when the user selects either Heath summary component 
    "SPN" (Selected Progress notes) or "PN" (Progress notes). If the user 
    selects a "scanned document," VistA will append the text "<  THE ABOVE 
    NOTE IS UNSIGNED  >" and "* DRAFT COPY *" to the bottom of the report 
    even though scanned documents do not require a signature and are not 
    drafts.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Stopped the text from being appended on scanned documents that have an 
    administrative closure date.
  
    Routine GMTSPN2 has been modified to check the TIU Document File. 
    If the "ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE MODE" (1613) field is set to 'S' FOR 
    scanned document, and "ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE DATE" (1606) has a value, 
    the note will be excluded from having the unwanted text appended.
  
  
 2) INC000000752225 - ADHOC HS Vital Signs Detailed Display issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When pain value of 99 is entered in vitals, the ADHOC Health Summary
    components ([VS] "Vital Signs", [VSD] "Vital Signs Detailed Display", and
    [SVS] "Vital Signs Selected") show the text "No Response." When you view
    the same info via the Vitals Cumulative report, it correctly shows the
    text as "Unable to Respond." No response to pain and unable to respond are
    two clinically different things.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed the components to display "Unable to Respond"
  
    Routines GMTSVS, GMTSVSD, and GMTSVSS have been modified to write "Unable 
    to Respond." GMTSVS was also modified to move Pain score to a new third 
    line. GMTSVSS was also modified to allot more space (18 characters) for 
    Pain score.
  
  
 3) INC000000784073 - Importing HS Object Questions
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the [GMTS OBJ EXPORT] option in VistA, if one of the 
    components used in the Health Summary type is a local component or has 
    selected Items, the process completes with no error reported. However, 
    when the receiving CAC  tries to use the imported object, it fails to 
    work. If VistA identifies the component as a local component or one that 
    has selected Items, it simply omits the component without any type of 
    error or warning.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified VistA to return an error message and abort the export if the CAC 
    tries to export a Health Summary Object that is associated with a Health 
    Summary Type with a local component or selected items component.
    The following error messages were approved by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup:
  
 "Can not export a Health Summary Object using a Health Summary Type that 
 contains Local Health Summary Components"
 "Health Summary Type <TYPE> contains Local Health Summary Component 
 <COMPONENT>"
  
 "Can not export a Health Summary Object using a Health Summary Type that 
 contains Health Summary Components with Selected Items"
 "Health Summary Type <TYPE> contains Health Summary Component <COMPONENT> 
 with Selected Items"
  
   Routine GMTSOBE has been modified to check the components prior to 
   export. If it finds a local or selected component it sets flag 
   GMTSCERR=1, displays the message, then quits the routine. 
 
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================

      first available FTP server.
 
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from the 
      ANONYMOUS SOFTWARE DIRECTORY from a specific server as follows:
