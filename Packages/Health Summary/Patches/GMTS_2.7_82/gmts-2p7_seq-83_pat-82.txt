 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000067936 - Exclude HF from Health Summary not working
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There is an option in the Health Factors file (#9999999.64) which
    controls whether or not a Health Factor is displayed on a Health
    Summary.  This option is not working correctly. Despite its value (Yes
    or No), the Health Factor always appears on a Health Summary report.
  
    Resolution: 
    -----------
    A check was added for the value of this option before displaying the 
    Health Factor. It should be noted that a factor's INACTIVE FLAG
    parameter has no effect on its Health Summary display (i.e., inactive
    factors may still display on a Health Summary).
  
    The Health Summary User Manual, Appendix A, Description of Health 
    Factors and Health Factors Select, will be updated with the following
    note to remind the users that these components can be turned off.
  
    "Note: Health Factors have a DISPLAY ON HEALTH SUMMARY Option that 
     determines whether or not they will show on a Health Summary report."
  
    **NOTE:  Patch PX*1.0*185 (released prior to this patch) will update
             the HEALTH FACTORS file (#9999999.94), All DISPLAY ON HEALTH
             SUMMARY field (#.08) to make this a required field and also 
             update any record with a null value to YES.
   
    Routines: GMTSPXFP, GMTSP82
  
  
 2. HD0000000070376 - Long e-sig block has wrap problem
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A user's electronic signature block title has an acceptable maximum 
    length of 50 characters.  However, if a signature is more than 37
    characters long and they sign a progress note, the Progress Notes
    (PN) and Selected Progress Notes (SPN) components display the signature
    incorrectly. The excess characters do not display on the same line and 
    end up on the next line.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The PN and SPN components have been modified to work correctly with the
    50 character limit of the electronic signature title.
  
    Routines: GMTSPN2
  
  
 3. HD0000000068035 - Col hdr missing(TIU-HS Obj): reminder 
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When you elect not to print the component header of a Health Summary
    Object that contains Clinical Reminders components, the column headers
    are also suppressed.  The data may be confusing to clinicians due to
    the lack of column headers.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The column headers are always written, regardless of any Health Summary
    Object parameters.
  
    Routines: GMTSPXHR
  
  
 4. HD0000000068352 - CHECKSUMS FOR CTD INSTALL
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The 'before patch' checksum for routine GMTSROE in the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) Code Text Description (CTD)
    Installation Guide, Appendix A - Checksums, is wrong.
  
    Currently, it shows a 'before checksum' of 17275235 which is incorrect.
                                       
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The document will be updated to show a 'before patch' checksum of
    16210996.
  
    Routines: None
  
  
 5. HD0000000089132  Spelling error in Reminders Summary
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The word IGNORE is spelled incorrectly (IGONORE) in the description of
    the Clinical Reminders Summary component via the [GMTS COMP INQ]
    option.
  
    This same misspelling occurs in the Health Summary User Manual, 
    Appendix A, Reminders Summary section and will be corrected.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The misspelling will be corrected to read IGNORE.
  
    Routines: GMTSP82
