Subject: MHAL AND MHAS COMPONENTS NOT SHOWING ALL ADMINISTRATIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch will correct a defect in the MHAL and MHAS Health Summary 
  components where all Mental Health instruments administered through the
  CPRS GUI do not display.
  
  
  ASSOCIATED NSR(s):
  ==================
  N/A
     
   
  ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
  ==================
  HD0000000299708 - MHAL and MHAS components do not show multiple 
                    administrations for same date
  
  
  
  PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
  =========================
  TBD
      
     
  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  HD0000000299708 - MHAL and MHAS components do not show multiple
                    administrations for same date
  Problem:
  --------
  When multiple instruments are administered for the same encounter date 
  through CPRS GUI Clinical Reminders via the Notes tab, only the results
  of the last instrument display in the MHAL and MHAS Health Summary 
  components.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  This patch modifies the Health Summary software so that all assessments 
  that are administered through the CPRS GUI Clinical Reminders Notes tab
  will now display regardless of encounter date.  Now,  if a user should
  happen to administer one or more of the same test and/or surveys for the
  same date, all results will populate and be displayed in the MHAL and
  MHAS Health Summary components.
  
  
  NOTE: Patch YS*5.01*102 must be installed for this to work.  If not 
  installed, pre-patch functionality will continue to occur.
