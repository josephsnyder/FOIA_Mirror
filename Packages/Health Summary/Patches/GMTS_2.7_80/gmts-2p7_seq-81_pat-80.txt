Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v27.  CPRS GUI 
 version 27 consists of two host files:  OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID and 
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID.  These two host files contain software 
 patches that support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  The host files were 
 created to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
 facilities.  Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.27 and Associated Patches 
 Installation Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document
 is exported as OR_30_243IG.doc and OR_30_243IG.pdf and is included in 
 OR_30_243.ZIP.  
  
 Installation and set-up information specific to GMTS*2.7*80 is included 
 in this patch description.
  
 OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID includes the CPRS and Pharmacy patches required for 
 CPRS GUI v27.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 OR*3*243
 PSJ*5*134
 PSO*7*225
  
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID includes the related and required patches 
 needed to support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  It includes builds for the 
 following patches:
 GMRA*4*38
 GMPL*2*35
 GMTS*2.7*80
 LR*5.2*365
 TIU*1*219
 WV*1*23
  
 Installation of the two CPRS host files should be coordinated among the 
 packages affected since these host files will install the majority of the 
 software needed to implement CPRS GUI v27.
