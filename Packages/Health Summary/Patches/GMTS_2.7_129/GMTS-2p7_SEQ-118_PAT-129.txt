 RTC Task 1010850 - Removing components to support Social Work decommission
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The purpose of this patch is to support patch SOW*3.0*65 (which will 
 completely decommission the Social Work (SOW) package from VistA) 
 and remove all Social Work GMTS code and components.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Remove 2 Social Work routines from the Health Summary namespace 
 (also modify one routine from the Health Summary namespace to remove 
 Social Work entry points in it.)  A post install will find any Health 
 Summary Components (#142.1) that contain GMTSSOWK in the PRINT ROUTINE 
 field and delete them from file #142.1.  These Health Summary components 
 will also be removed from any records in the Health Summary Type file 
 #142.  The post install will find any protocols in file (#101) that 
 contains GMTS SW Health Summary Social Work and remove from file #101.   
 The post install will send a mailman message to the installer 
 listing which components were deleted and from what Health Summary Type 
 records.
  
 References to Social Work will be removed from the Health Summary 
 documents; Installation Guide, User Manuals and Technical Manual.
  
 NOTE: Any GMTS class 3 with any Social Work package references should be 
 reviewed prior to being inactivated or removed.  A ticket to Tier 3 
 should be created if assistance is needed in reviewing these items.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. Because this patch deleted routines and 
 permanently removed several entry points in another routine back-out 
 must be done with the participation of the sustainment team.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 Restoring the components modified in file #101, #142 & #142.1 can only be 
 accomplished with the participation of the sustainment team.
