 Modifications were made to the VistARad software for the Stack Viewer as 
 follows:
  
 Corrected problem where display attributes were not being propagated when 
 the Split Stack feature was used. Now, when a stack is split, the new 
 stacks both have the same display attributes as the original stack.
  
 Corrected error that caused VistARad to stop functioning some time after 
 when split stack feature was used. 
  
 Corrected the calculation problem that occurred when the "Inches" option 
 was used in the Calibrate dialog.
  
 Changed how 'Show/Hide measurements' works in the Stack Viewer.  
 Originally, if there were multiple measurements in a stack, choosing 
 'Show/Hide' from the measurements context menu would hide only the 
 current measurement.  Now, when 'Show/Hide measurements' is used, all 
 measurements are hidden, regardless if the option was selected from a 
 measurement's context menu, or from the stack's context menu.  
  
 Corrected problem where a measurement annotation would be deleted if the 
 image was placed in a new stack using the Split Stack feature. Now, when 
 a stack is split, any pre-existing measurement annotations are retained.
  
 Reversed the direction of stack progression when using a scroll wheel to 
 display images in a stack. Initially, rolling the scroll wheel forward 
 (away from the user) would cause the Stack Viewer to scroll backward in 
 the stack.  Now, rolling the scroll wheel forward causes the Stack Viewer 
 to move forward in a stack.
  
 Corrected problems associated with clicking slice lines in a scout 
 image.  Initially, any mouse movements made while clicking a slice line 
 would interfere with the intended result (display image in associated 
 stack).  Now, small amounts of mouse movement will not interfere with 
 clicking on slice lines.
  
 When a Window/Level operation was performed on the top image in a stack, 
 it wouldn't be applied to the other images when scrolling through an 
 image stack. This has been corrected so that the window/level applied on 
 one image will be applied for all images in the stack.
  
 If a study had two DICOM Study Instance UIDs (Unique Identifiers), the 
 stack viewer would stop loading and wait. Now studies with different 
 Study Instance UIDs will be processed.
  
 There is now a message that appears at the bottom of the stack viewer 
 that states "Processing Complete". This was developed in response to 
 studies that sometimes fail to load. The user now knows when processing 
 is done, or when a failure has occurred in loading the images into the 
 stack.
  
 Corrected problem where the icon in the upper left corner of cells in the 
 stack viewer would disappear.
  
 On the Manager, the custom list button can now be enabled or disabled.  
 Previously, if the user disabled the custom button, all custom buttons 
 were lost and had to be reset by the administrator.
  
  
 Changes made to the DICOM Gateway software are as follows:
  
 Improved DICOM support for both single floating point (FL - 4 bytes in 
 length) and double precision floating point (FD - 8 bytes in length) 
 value representations (VRs) when processing images.  These are encoded 
 using the IEEE 754:1985 32-bit and 64-bit floating point standard. Fix 
 was in response to NOIS entries. 
  
 Modified the software to process Modality Worklist queries that contained 
 a double asterisk for the patient name value; this was required for the 
 GE Sigma MR and is a vendor specific issue.
  
 Changed the delay before a C-MOVE request to an EMED PACS to 8-minutes 
 and made the delay period configurable.
  
  
 The Background Processor has been modified to correct the following:
  
 Fixed a problem on GCC (Generic Carbon Copy) queues entries.  When the
 background processor could not connect to the HEC (Health Eligibility 
 Center) remote network to copy the image, the background processor would 
 attempt the copy indefinitely.  This has been corrected, the background 
 processor will attempt three times to copy the image to the remote 
 network and after the third try will stop and send an email to the 
 defined group. Once the network connection has been resolved, the failed 
 queue entry will require manual intervention by using the 'Queue Manager' 
 to process the failed entry.  Also, corrected the log to record the 
 dialog to identify the network connect attempt.  Previous entries 
 contained erroneous messages such as:  TIF Unable to copy to the current 
 fileserver: 0: No error
  
 Fields USER NAME and PASSWORD are required fields when creating a network 
 location of Storage Type GCC; the Network Location Manager menu option 
 will now require these fields before storing the entry in the Network 
 Location file (2005.2).
  
 Resolved the issue of displaying/deleting the last entry in the Queue 
 Manager display window. 
  
 Corrected the "UNDEF" error that occurred when entering a new Network 
 Location entry if the "Online Status" checkbox was deselected.
  
 The "Help" option on the Background Processor's main window has been 
 moved to the right of View option.
  
 Corrected the display of the HASH SUBDIRECTORY and ROUTER fields when 
 displaying existing network location entries. Previously these entries 
 did not display correctly nor could the user edit and save the settings.  
 Also, corrected the problem where the Background Processor would reset 
 the HASH SUBDIRECTORY field to 'YES' on existing Network Location entries 
 after reviewing the entry using the 'Edit\Network Location' menu 
 option.   The results of this had a major impact on entries of WORM 
 Storage Type (jukebox entries) especially when the initial entry was set 
 to be NO for the HASH SUBDIRECTORY field value and then reset to 'YES' by 
 the Background Processor; the result of this was the jukebox would be 
 unreachable and the status on the log activity would indicate 'JBSleep'. 
  
 The following change is for sites that are actively participating in the 
 Health Eligibility Center (HEC) project where a copy of the scanned means 
 test is exported to their network location. This patch has a post install 
 routine that will evaluate if the Imaging Site Parameter file (2006.1) 
 has the GCC EXPORT LOC (field .07) defined.  If so, it will set the field 
 ACTION IS ACTIVE to YES for entries MEANS TEST (10-10EZ) and MEANS TEST 
 (10-10F) in the MAG DESCRIPTIVE CATEGORY file (2005.81).  This will cause 
 Means Test copies to be sent to the HEC directory.

 Routine modifications
 ==================== 
 The following routines were modified for this patch.
  
  
 DICOM Gateway routines:
 Routines MAGDDR0, MAGDDR2A, MAGDDR3, MAGDD20, and MAGDDW4 were modified 
 to correct the problem with images that require a floating point value 
 conversion.
  
 MAGDEXC1 modified the delay before C-MOVE to 8-minutes and made the delay 
 time configurable.
  
 MAGDFND2 modified to ignore double asterisk "**" for patient name on 
 modality worklist queries
  
 MAGDVRSN is the routine used to verify the latest patched version of the 
 DICOM gateway software and is distributed in all patches for DICOM 
 software.
  
 Background Processor routines:
 Routines   MAGBAPI, MAGQBAB, and MAGQBTM were modified to correct the 
 problem with the management and processing of queue entries.
   
 Data Dictionary
  ============
 A partial dictionary for file 2005.2, NETWORK LOCATION, is included in 
 the KIDS application, sending fields 1, PHYSICAL REFERENCE, and 5, 
 OPERATIONAL STATUS.  The input transform for field 5 has been modified as 
 follows and field 1 is included because both fields are used in the C 
 compound cross-reference. 
 Field 5 input transform:
 OPERATIONAL STATUS INPUT TRANSFORM: Q:DA["+1"  
 S:$P(^MAG(2005.2,DA,0),U,6)="" $P
 (^MAG(2005.2,DA,0),U,6)="0"
