 IMAGE FILE TYPES (#2005.021), The following fields are NEW.
 FORMAT IS SUPPORTED (#021.06)   New. Fields value of YES allows images 
 of the file type to be captured. Field Value of NO means imaging does 
 not support the file type and a message is shown and capture is 
 cancelled.
  
 IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS (#2006.1), The following field is NEW.
 VERSION NAG MESSSAGE (#132)  New. Field value of YES displays a message 
 to users of supported clients that are not the released version. The 
 message informs the user that they should update the client to the 
 Released version. Value of NO will suppress the message, no message will
 display.

 Security Keys
 =============

 still being used in Patch 93 and earlier versions of Clinical Display.
  
 Remote Procedures
 =================
  
 There are no new or modified remote procedures included in this patch.
  
 Menu Options
 ============
  
 The Imaging System Manager Menu [MAG CLIENT VERSION REPORT] is a menu
 option contained in the Imaging System Manager Menu [MAG SYS MENU] sub
 menu. It is a report designed to print all workstations that need to be
 updated before they will be allowed to connect to VistA. It has been
 modified to make the output more useful to the user.
  
 Changes include:
  
 * Limiting the search to a number of days prior to today that a 
   workstation was used to log into VistA.
  
 * Searching for only Workstation names that contain certain text.
  
 * Include all workstations in the report. 
  
 Note:  If this option is selected, then workstations that do not need 
        updated will have an '*' displayed next to their name.
