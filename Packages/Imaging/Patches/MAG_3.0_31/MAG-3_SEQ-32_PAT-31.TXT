Subject: Image Index Maintenance Phase III

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VistA Imaging Patch 31, Image Index Conversion Phase III, contains
 enhancements and fixes to the functionality introduced in Patches 17 and
 25. Patches 17 and 25 added "index" fields to key files in the Imaging
 System and provided conversion tools to populate these fields. Patch 31
 provides an updated version of the conversion tool, and contains 
 enhancements to the index vocabulary files and to the conversion process 
 (to be performed after Patch 31 installation). 
  
 Proper implementation of Patch 31 will ensure that patient images are 
 categorized in a consistent manner from site to site. Future patches will 
 rely on the changes introduced in Patch 31.
  
 Note for sites that have started or performed the Patch 17 or Patch 25 
 conversion:  Installing Patch 31 will not clear any pre-existing index 
 field values. The conversion tool may be rerun against all Image file 
 entries after installing Patch 31, or may be run against only those 
 entries that were previously indexed.  Proper implementation of Patch 31
 will ensure that patient images are categorized in a consistent manner
 from site to site. Future patches will rely on the changes introduced in
 Patch 31. Please review document, MAG3_0P31_Patch_Description.pdf,
 for details and instructions regarding this patch.
  
 Note: Do not install this patch if your site is a test site for the VistA 
 Imaging v2.5 consolidation software.
