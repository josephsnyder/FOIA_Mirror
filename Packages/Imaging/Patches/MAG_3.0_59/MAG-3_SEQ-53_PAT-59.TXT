 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 NOTE:  After installing the KIDS package, determine if version checking 
 for Clinical Display and Capture is to be enabled or disabled (it is 
 enabled by the Install  process). For more information, see "Version 
 Checking for Display and Capture" on page 20 of the Patch Description.
  
 NOTE:  The Post Install of Patch 59 automatically queues the new Imaging
 Index FIX utility.  For more information, see on page 25 of the Patch 
 Description.
  
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 disruption.  Users may be on the system during installation.  
 Installation will take longer than normal due to the Index Fix Utility 
 that is started during the install.  The Fix Utility takes approximately 
 10 minutes for each 1 Million Images.  This patch must be installed by 
 the compliance date to conform with VHA Directive 2001-023.

       option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the 
       patch. 
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM] -
       run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made
       when the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and
       so on) in the patch will be compared.
    c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - run this option if you want
       to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch.
       It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install
    the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
