Description:
============

 VistA Imaging Clinical Document Imaging patch, MAG*3.0*8, includes major 
 enhancements to Clinical Capture and Display.  It also includes 
 enhancements and fixes to the Background Processor.  It introduces the 
 new Diagram Annotation tool. 
  
 NOTE:  Read the Steps to Get Ready For Patch 8.doc first before installing 
 Patch 8.
 
 Major changes are outlined below. 
  
 Clinical Display Changes:
 - Filtering and enhanced index support.  Filters can be used to list 
   subsets of images in the Image List and the Abstract windows based on 
   procedure, specialty, etc..
 - The Full Resolution viewer has been redesigned for display of scanned 
   documents and multiple images. 
 - Enhanced user preferences can now be defined and saved.
 - Numerous usability enhancements and bug fixes for the Full Resolution 
   viewer, the Radiology viewer, the Image List window, and the 
   Abstract/Group Abstract windows.
  
 Clinical Capture Changes:
 - Index field support - Values are specified for new index fields during 
   image capture
 - Workflow enhancements including Hold Value (used to prevent input 
   field values from being cleared until explicitly changed by the user)
 - despeckle and deskew
 - Expanded user preferences
 - Additional properties can now be saved as part of a capture 
   configuration definition.
 - Numerous usability enhancements have been made to the main Capture 
   window, the Configurations dialog, and the Capture Configurations
   dialog.
  
 Diagram Annotation tool (NEW):
 - The new Diagram Annotation tool can be used to select a
   diagram image from a site-defined collection. The 
   selected diagram can then be annotated online and saved
   as part of a patient's record.
  
 Background Processor Changes:
 - Improved abstract processing.
 - Network Location support for Routing and the new Diagram Annotation 
   tool.
 - Assorted bug fixes.
  
 VistA Imaging Host Changes:
 - Post Processing (used for automatic transmission of Means Test forms) 
   has been modified for ease of maintenance and improved flexibility.
 - A new group delete option, available in the Imaging System Manager Menu.
 - New security keys to manage filters, image access, and Radiology 
   viewer presets for Clinical Display.

 v2.5 consolidation software.
