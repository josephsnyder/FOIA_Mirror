Subject: MAG Enterprise Productivity Reports Update

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This emmergency patch, MAG*3*78, will re-establish the date and time of
 the generation of the monthly site report. Prior to this patch the date
 and time was established in Patch 29 as 0400 on the 2nd day of each
 month.  As a result of a request by senior management to produce these
 reports on an earlier date it is necessary to have these reports tasked to
 be generated on the 1st day of each month.
  
 Routine MAGQE4 was modified to reschedule the Monthly Site Usage Report 
 from the second day of the month at 4:01am to the first day of the month 
 at the same time.  When TaskMan schedules this task the task number 
 assigned by TaskMan is stored in the IMAGING SITE PARAMETER file 
 (#2006.1) in field SERVER TASK (#10).  
 When this patch is installed the post install routine will stop the 
 present task and reschedule the task to the 1st day of the month.  
 TaskMan menu option, LIST TASK [XUTM INQ], can be used to verify the 
 schedule time of this task.
