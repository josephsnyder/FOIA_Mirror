  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch 66 Overview:
 ==================
 
 This patch introduces a program to execute queries and export DICOM objects. 
 It will enable current specialty workstations, PACS, and teleradiology 
 systems to query and retrieve images residing on VistA Imaging via the DICOM 
 Gateway. 
 
 This patch will:
 
      - Allow devices outside of VistA Imaging to fetch images without user 
        intervention, thereby reducing the current need for human resources to 
        provide accessibility to images on VistA Imaging.
 
      - Allow communication of VistA Imaging images with commercial PACS and 
        other systems using standard DICOM Query/Retrieve services.
 
 DICOM Query/Retrieve requires configuration for any system that uses it. Care 
 must be taken to comply with HIPAA and Privacy Act regulations. 
 
 NOTE    All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 that have implemented DICOM 
         Gateways must install the KIDS portion of this patch on the VistA 
         System, and the updated DICOM Gateway software on all DICOM Gateway 
         systems.

 Patch 66 Enhancements:
 ======================
 
 Patch 66 is an enhancement patch for the VistA Imaging software. This patch 
 brings about the following enhancements:
 
 Specific Enhancements:
 ======================
 
      - Patch 66 offers the ability to perform DICOM queries against the VistA 
        Imaging system.
 
      - Using the DICOM Query response, Patch 66 offers the ability to 
        perform retrieval of images from VistA Imaging.
 
      - Images associated with patients designated as "sensitive  can also be 
        retrieved. The data elements are not masked, allowing both the patient 
        and the provider to be identified. 
        
 WARNING: Because the medical records of sensitive patients are not blocked 
          and because the data in these records is not masked, control of 
          these records is achieved through the set of authorized users that 
          can query and access the VistA database. It is the responsibility of 
          the VA Medical center that is providing the records that are 
          retrieved using Patch 66 (and Query/Retrieve) to ensure that the 
          privacy guidelines of HIPAA, the Federal Privacy Act, VA Directive 
          6500, and all other applicable regulations are met. For more 
          information about patient privacy and patient privacy regulations, 
          consult your local Privacy and Security Officers. 
 
 WARNING: If a VA Medical Center plans to provide access to Query/Retrieve 
          (Patch 66) to a DICOM device outside the VA, before implementing and 
          activating the connection, the system administrator at the site must
          consult the site Information Security Officer and ensure that the 
          facility has a properly signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA). 
 
 Security Keys:

 Installation:
 =============
 
 Installation Planning:
 ======================
 
 When planning the installation of Patch 66, the following factors should be 
 considered.
 
      - This patch is to be installed on the VistA System and on all DICOM 
        Gateways. Installing the KIDS on the VistA system will take less than 
        one minute. DICOM Gateway installation will take 5 - 30 minutes based 
        on workstation hardware.
 
      - Users may remain on the system during the KIDS installation.
 
      - After the KIDS portion of Patch 66 is installed, the client (DICOM 
        Gateway) portion of Patch 66 may be installed on one DICOM Gateway at 
        a time, or on all DICOM Gateways at once. 
 
      - Before installing Patch 66 on a DICOM Gateway, all processing on the 
        DICOM Gateway being updated must be stopped. However, Cachi must 
        remain active.  Other DICOM Gateways, if present, can remain active. 
 
      - All DICOM Gateways must be updated to Patch 66 by the compliance date
        listed for this patch.
 
 All of the installation instructions in this document should be reviewed 
 before beginning installation.
 
 NOTE    Do not use Remote Desktop to install the DICOM Gateway software. 
         Attempts to install it using Remote Desktop will fail. You can use 
         other applications such as PC Anywhere and DameWare for remote 
         installations.
 
 Installation Prerequisites:
 ===========================
 
 NOTE    It is required that all released VistA Imaging patches, including 
         Patch 54, are installed on the VistA System and on all DICOM 
         Gateways before installing Patch 66. 
 
 Before installing this patch, it is recommended that sites address any failed 
 images using the following two menu options on the VistA System:
 
      - Correct RAD-DICOM File Entries [MAGD FIX DICOM FILE].
 
      - Correct Clinical Specialties DICOM File Entries [MAGD FIX CLINSPEC 
        DICOM FILE] (if sites acquire Consults studies).
 
 NOTE    Create a backup copy of their current dictionary (.dic) files before 
         installing this patch on any DICOM gateways.
 
 You can download the patch installation files from the Imaging FTP site. 
 All instructions in this section presume that files for this patch have been 
 copied to a local storage location. Files included with this patch are listed
 in Section Patch Contents.
 
 Laurel Bridge DICOM Server Runtime License:
 ===========================================
 
 A license key has to be purchased for the Laurel Bridge DCF Local Server 
 Run-time DICOM software used by the Query/Retrieve application. The Importer 
 application uses the same license. There is no need to purchase and install 
 a license if:
 
      - The Query/Retrieve functionality will be used on a DICOM Gateway on 
        which the Importer application is enabled.
 
      - The Query/Retrieve functionality will not be used on the DICOM 
        Gateway. 
 
 How the License Works:
 ======================
 
 Each computer on which the Query/Retrieve application is installed requires a 
 separate license. Because the license is keyed to the computer s MAC address, 
 the license cannot be transferred from one computer to another. As a result, 
 the Laurel Bridge software will no longer function if the network card or if 
 the entire computer is replaced. In these situations, Laurel Bridge needs to 
 be contacted in order to a transfer the license to the new system and get a 
 new key.
 
 Java Engine:
 ============
 
 The Query/Retrieve application requires the Java Engine. The Java Engine must 
 be installed on all workstations on which Query/Retrieve will be used. The 
 Importer application also requires the Java Engine. Computers that are set up 
 to use the Importer already have the Java Engine installed. For instructions 
 about installing the Java Engine, see Running the Java Installer on page 22
 of the MAG3_0P66_Patch_Description.pdf document.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation:
 =================================
 
 KIDS Installation Steps:
 ========================
 
 KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 
 1.  Important: Before installing the KIDS, perform the following steps for 
     each gateway:
 
     a.  Stop each process (use CTRL+C if needed) in each active process/
         telnet window. (Note that clicking [ X ] only closes the window; it 
         does not stop the process).
 
     b.  Navigate to the main DICOM Gateway menu and enter 5 (Quit).
 
     c.  Ensure that Cachi is running. (When Cachi is running, Cachi cube in 
         the Windows taskbar is blue).
 
 2.  On the VistA System, access the Kernel Installation and Distribution 
     System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 
 3.  Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 
 4.  Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps.
 
     a.  Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to load 
         the KIDS distribution.
     
     b.  When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P66.KID) of the 
         Patch 66 KIDS file.
     c.  When prompted to continue with the load, enter YES. A Distribution 
         OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 
 5.  After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the 
     contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
 
     - Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM]   Run this 
       option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the 
       patch.
 
     - Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM]   
       Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made when 
       the patch is installed. All components (routines, options, and so on) 
       in the patch will be compared.
 
     - Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP]   Run this option if you want 
       to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch. It 
       will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 
 6.  After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install 
     the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
 
      a.  Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
 
      b.  When prompted for the install name, enter MAG*3.0*66.
 
      c.  Answer NO to the following prompts:
 
      Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
      Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
      Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
 
 7.  When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will be 
     displayed.
 
 8.  Restart processes on DICOM Gateways as needed.
