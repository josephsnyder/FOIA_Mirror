Subject: Storing DICOM Objects, Phase II

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 VistA Imaging patch 52, Storing DICOM Objects, is phase II in a process 
 that will provide the DICOM storage capability. For historical reasons,
 DICOM images processed by VistA have been converted into a text file
 (*.TXT, for the information in the DICOM header) and a Targa. (TGA) format
 image file and stored in the database.  While the technique has worked
 well in the past when DICOM viewing software was not available, it is
 somewhat limited in that it doesn't support a number of DICOM capabilities
 (multi-frame images, color images, look up tables, imbedded thumbnail
 icons, etc.).  Now that VistA provides DICOM viewing software, the intent
 is to store the images as DICOM objects in VistA exactly as they are
 received.  The text file will continue to be used to redundantly hold the
 DICOM header information for easy retrieval.
  
 This capability will be added to VistA in (a minimum of) three stages.  
 With Patch 10, released November 2003, this DICOM storage was enabled for 
 non-radiology healthcare providers images (dentistry, ophthalmology, 
 endoscopy, cardiology, pathology, etc.)  With patch, MAG*3.0*5, released 
 December 2004, this capability was extended to Bone Densitometry, 
 Ultrasound, and Nuclear Medicine.  With this patch, this capability is 
 expanded to images from the additional modalities listed below which are 
 acquired as a result of requested procedures requested in Consults (CON) 
 Requests.  
  
 Patch 52 is extended to the following modalities, which will be enabled 
 for saving images in native DICOM for Consults (CON) to:
 CD = Color Flow Doppler, 
 DD = Duplex Doppler, 
 ES = Endoscopy,  
 ST =  Single-Photon Emission Computer Tomography, 
 XA = X-Ray Angiography, 
 RF =  Radio Fluoroscopy, 
 GM = General Microscopy,                              
 SM = Slide Microscopy.
  
 Patch 52 accepts Cardiology images by virtue of other Modality Codes in
 the list, with the exception of Waveform images.  For example, Cardiac
 Cath uses such modalities as XA, CD, DD and US.

 Routine MAGIPS52 is a post-init routine that is automatically           
 deleted after the KIDS application installs.  'Old style' checksums are 
 calculated using the Kernel utility program CHECK^XTSUMBLD and 'new 
 style' checksums are calculates using the Kernel utility program 
 CHECK1^XTSUMBLD
  
  
 Installation instructions:
