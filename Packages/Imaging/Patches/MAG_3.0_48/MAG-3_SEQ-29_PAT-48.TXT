Description:
============

  
 VistA Imaging Clinical Document Imaging patch, MAG*3.0*48, is a follow up
 to patch MAG*3*8.  It includes major enhancements to Clinical Capture and
 Display, enhancements and fixes to the Background Processor, and on-line 
 help for the Diagram Annotation window.
   
  
 Major changes are outlined below.
  
 Patch 48 contains the following new functions and features: 
 - There is a new option on the tools menu in Display that allows the 
   user to reopen the Cine View window if it should get closed.
 - The Cine Control window can no longer be adjusted according to size.
 - The maximum number of frames in a selected image is now displayed in 
   the Cine View window.
 - In Display DOD and FEE check boxes were added to the choices for 
   Origin on Image Filter window.  
 - In Capture DOD and FEE were added to Origin field list of values.
 - The type index terms, OUTSIDE MEDICAL RECORD (FEE AND DOD) are no 
   longer available.  These are replaced with the type index MEDICAL 
   RECORD modified by an Origin Index selection.  
 - Sites can enable or disable version checking for Clinical Display 
   and Capture by setting a new field in the IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS file 
   (#2006.1).
 - Support staff may modify the number of days that full images are 
   kept on RAID storage.
 - Auto-purge - new feature that automatically starts and stops the 
   purge process without user intervention.
 - The magnifying glass tool now defaults to the magnify option in the 
   Radiology window.
 - The Private and Public Filters lists in the Image Filter Add/Edit
   window now displays a "delete" option in the popup menu.
 - New functions have been added to the Image Delete window. The functions
   give the user the option of displaying details associated with the Image
   or Image Group.  Also, abstracts and reports can be viewed for images 
   that have Questionable Integrity issues.
 - Image Groups can now be deleted from the Imaging Display GUI.  Users 
   must have the security keys MAG DELETE and MAG SYSTEM.  The 'Image 
   Group Delete' menu option will not be visible for users that do not
   have the required keys.
 - Added '5 years' as a new filter date selection in the Filter Edit window
   "Date Range" dropdown list.
 - The Release of Information (ROI) support staff will now be able to 
   utilize the following new reason "Authorized Release of Medical Records
   or Health Information (ROI )" added to the lists of reasons for
   Print/Copy.
  
 Patch 48 corrects problems so that: 
 - The Radiology viewer will not display FullRes images that have an 
   odd number of columns in the image header information.
 - In DICOM images, the user is now able to adjust the brightness and 
   contrast of color with a right-mouse drag. 
 - The patient's name now appears in the Image Information Advanced 
   window.

   in the FullRes viewer.

   image filename is greater than 80 characters long.
 - The patient's name and SSN are displayed on all printed images. 
 - When editing the "Package" parameter on a Filter, users can now 
   select an entry that is less than three characters, e.g. "CP". 
 - Duplicate Import queue entries are only processed once, but are 
   only re-queued twice when the process is failed.
 - Printing multi-page images will now require a single electronic 
   signature.
 - When selecting an Import Directory, the filename in the Import 
   Directory dialog window defaults to "all files".
 - Defaults are set correctly for paging in Stack Mode for Clinical
   Display client Radiology Viewer.
 - Diagram Annotation will now display the on-line help file correctly.
 - Background Processor log files are no longer automatically purged. 
   They are now placed in their own "LOG" subfolder descending from 
   the application subfolder.
 - The SCHEDULED PURGE TIME field (field# 64 in file #2006.1) will 
   now accept 3 or 4 digits in 24 hour inputs.

   processor display window.
 - "Wrong case/exam/accession number" has been added to the list of 
   "Reasons for deletion" in the Image Delete Window.
 - All images that have Questionable Integrity issues are now allowed to

   lines if the entire toolbar cannot be displayed at once.

   the Right orientation marker "R", users can still view images and 
   markers in a configuration that does not allow much screen space.
 - The Radiology Window images will now allow the caption to include the 
   case number of one or two studies.  The case number is included in 
   each individual stack and a hint is now viewable when mouse stays near
   the caption beneath each individual image.
 - Images that were incorrectly exported to an Imaging magnetic drive,
   instead of being copied to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) share
   will now be correctly exported to the designated HEC share.
 - The report button in the FullRes window now displays a "confirmation 
   message" if the user has not loaded or selected images.
 - Changing associations in the Capture window no longer generates an 
   "access violation".

   when the list is empty.

   List" without a name.

   "Close Selected" and "Close All" buttons as the last two on the first 
   row when the toolbar wraps into two rows.
 - Field Unit Test 51 is included in Patch 48. Field Unit Test 51 
   corrected the error that occurred during the capture process when 
   verifying the value of the Institution.  The error would disable the 
   ability to capture Lab Images from the Capture Workstation.
 - The Online help for the Delete window is now the correct file.
 - The Configuration buttons in Capture will now resize automatically to 
   fit the button title. Buttons will wrap into as many rows needed or 
   display scroll buttons to the right of toolbar if there are more 
   buttons than can fit in a single row.
 - Future dates will no longer be allowed for both the "Study Date" and 
   "Document Date" fields.
