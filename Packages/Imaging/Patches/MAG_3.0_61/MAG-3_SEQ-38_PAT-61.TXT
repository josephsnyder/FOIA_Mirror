  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch provides the utility that will automatically update VistA files 
 including Image Index Term files by processing a VA MailMan message containing 
 new values that have been approved by the VistA Imaging Index Term Review Board.
  
 Sequence of events for Imaging Index Term Updates:
  
 (1)  Person logs into the 'VistA Imaging Index Tracker' Web application and 
 enters a request for an addition or change to the Imaging Index Term Files.  
  
 (2) Requests entered into the Index Tracker are reviewed by the VistA Imaging 
 Index Term Review Board.  Individual requests will be given a status of either 
 Approved, Disapproved or Under Review-Need information from requestor.
  
 (3) Modifications are made to the 'Base' copy of the Index Term Files to reflect
 all Approved requests.  The new 'Base' copy of Index Term Files are sent to all
 sites via a MailMan message.
  
 (4) Personnel at the sites execute the menu option MAG INDEX TERMS UPDATE, 
 which replaces the Index Term Files at the site with the new 'Base' copy of the 
 files.
  
 Additions to the index term files can be requested via the VistA Imaging Index 
 Term Tracker - http://indextracker.imaging.med.va.gov:8080/indextracker/
  
  
 Patch 61 contains two changes to the hospital database of VistA Imaging. 
 1.  New menu options will be added under menu option MAG IMAGE INDEX UTIL:
       
        Image Index Terms Update [MAG INDEX TERMS UPDATE]
        Image Index Terms Restore [MAG INDEX TERMS RESTORE]
        
                
 The above menu options provide a utility, including rollback capability
 that will automatically update VistA files (including Image Index Term
 files) by processing a VA MailMan message containing new values that have
 been approved by the VistA Imaging Index Term Review Board.
  
        Image Index Specialty/Subspecialty Status [MAG INDEX SPECIALTY]
        Image Index Procedure/Event Status [MAG INDEX PROCEDURE]
  
 The user can change the status of an entry in either the IMAGE INDEX FOR 
 SPECIALTY/SUBSPECIALTY (#2005.84) or IMAGE INDEX FOR PROCEDURE/EVENT 
 (#2005.85) file.
  
  
 2.  The VistA Imaging Capture application displays a subset of the entries in 
 the IMAGE INDEX FOR TYPES file (#2005.83) in a 'Doc/Image Type' list for the 
 user to select.  Each INDEX TYPE in file 2005.83 has a CLASS Property and the 
 entries that are displayed in this list are based on the CLASS of the Image 
 being captured.  The following table shows which INDEX TYPES will be selectable
 in the 'Doc/Image Type' list, based on the Class of the Image.
  
 For Document/           Index Types that have these 
 Images of Class --      Classes will be listed for selection:

 ADMIN                    ADMIN, ADMIN/CLIN or CLIN/ADMIN
