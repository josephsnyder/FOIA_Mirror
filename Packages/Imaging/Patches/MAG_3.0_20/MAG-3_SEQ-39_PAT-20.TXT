Description:
============

 This patch provides the necessary changes to the VistA Imaging software in order
 to support multi-divisional and traditional VistA environments with a single 
 Imaging software release.  In the past, multi-divisional sites were supported by
 Version 2.5 and traditional sites were supported by Version 3.0.  In 
 addition, this patch contains several enhancements and fixes for the Background
 Processor (BP) Applications.
  
 This patch includes a KIDS package and the Background Processor Applications: 
 Queue Processor, Verifier and Purge client software. 
  
 FDA regulations require that each Imaging software distribution is 
 documented and tracked by the VistA Imaging project. To receive this
 patch, sites must have a Site Agreement filed with and approved by the 
 VistA Imaging Group.  For information about the status of a Site 
 Agreement, contact the Site Feedback group via email at 
 VHAVISiteFeedback@va.gov.
  
 Detailed patch information and installation instructions can be found in 
 the MAG3_0P20 Patch Description. Any late-breaking information will be 
 documented in a readme file.
