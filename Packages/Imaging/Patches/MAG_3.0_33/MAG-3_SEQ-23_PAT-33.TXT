Subject: Windows XP support for Clinical Display/Capture

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 Patch 33 primarily addresses many permissions issues that system 
 administrators and users are experiencing when installing and running 
 VistA Imaging Clinical Display and Capture on Windows 2000 and Windows XP 
 systems.  This patch automatically sets the appropriate keys and 
 permissions on registry keys, files, and folders to enable a basic user 
 to run the application.  In addition, there are several fixes for the EKG 
 window in Display.  Also there are some changes to the warning messages 
 when users are blocked from viewing images.  Capture will support the new 
 Matrox Mil-Lite Toolkit with support for Windows XP.  A potential patient 
 safety issue concerning clearing patient data when switching to a 
 different patient is fixed.  During capture, failure to set the queue for 
 jukebox copy results in a warning message being sent to the user.  
 Finally, systems with grayscale video cards will no longer be blocked 
 from viewing images.
