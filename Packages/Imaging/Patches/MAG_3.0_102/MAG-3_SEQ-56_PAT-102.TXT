============

 Patch 102 resolves a number of issues with the DICOM Modality Worklist.  
  
 - HL7 transaction time is in seconds while the scheduled time is now in
   minutes with a GMT offset.
 - The G-cross references are now being removed for both Consults and
   Radiology.
 - GMT offsets are now handled properly.  Radiology Patch 84 is the first
   that timestamps with GMT offsets are used.
  
 Radiology Patch 75 introduces the REASON FOR STUDY field, VistA Imaging 
 has made some adjustments to now utilize this field.
