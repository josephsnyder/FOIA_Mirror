Subject: Import API Maintenance

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The VistA Imaging Import API COM object that was released in VistA 
 Imaging v3.0 patch 15 (MAG*3.0*15) has been modified to use the CCOW User 
 Context features implemented by the RPC Broker XWB*1.1*40 patch.  The COM 
 object will no longer require the VA Kernel Auto Sign-on privilege for 
 users of the Import API.  Auto Sign-on will be accomplished through CCOW
 User Context.
  
 The Import API COM object is currently used by the Veterans ID Card (VIC)
 application.  The COM object will be given to the VIC software developer
 (Maximus) who will bundle it with their application.  The PIMS team will 
 be updating their COM object (also used in the VIC application) and 
 will be releasing an informational patch (DG*5.3.724) in conjunction with
 this patch.  The VIC application software will be bundled in InstallShield
 package and will be put on the VA Anonymous FTP server.  The DG*5.3.724
 patch description will give instructions on downloading and installing 
 the VIC application software. 
  
  
  
 Background information:
 ------------------------
 The Veterans ID Card (VIC) application that's currently deployed at all 
 VA medical centers uses 2 COM objects for interfacing with the VistA and 
 VistA Imaging systems at each site.  One COM object was developed by the 
 PIMS team to give the VIC application access to patient and eligibility 
 data.  The second COM object was developed by the VistA Imaging team to 
 allow the VIC application to upload patient photo images into VistA 
 Imaging.  Both COM objects use the VA RPC Broker to control access to the 
 VistA server.  The current VIC application requires the use of the VA 
 Kernel Auto Sign-on feature to eliminate having the user prompted 
 multiple times for sign-on when they run the VIC application.  This 
 feature requires the user to be granted Auto-Sign-on privileges by the 
 local system administrator.  Some sites don't grant these privileges 
 which results in the user having to enter their Access/Verify code pair 
 multiple times when running the VIC application.  This is 
 counter-productive for users when using the VIC (or any) application
  
 The VIC II (part 2) project was initiated to eliminate the need for 
 multiple sign-ons.  The Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) standard 
 has a feature called User Context which allows disparate applications to 
 detect if a user is already signed on when the application is launched.  
 The credentials of the logged in user can be retrieved and used to 
 automatically sign on to the new instance of the application.
