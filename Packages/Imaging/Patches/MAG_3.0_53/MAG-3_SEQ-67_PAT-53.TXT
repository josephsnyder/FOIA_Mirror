Subject: DICOM IMPORT I

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Importer is a new application on the DICOM Image Gateway that can be 
 used to import DICOM objects into VistA Imaging from studies that were
 performed outside of the VA.  Both ordered and unordered studies can
 quickly be imported using this application.  These DICOM objects may be
 transmitted directly from the outside facility to the VA, as in the case
 for the studies for the Polytrauma patients, or they may be loaded from
 portable media (CDs in particular). An important prerequisite is that the
 portable media file set be created as specified by both the DICOM standard
 and the IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Portable Data for
 Imaging (PDI) Integration profile.
  
 The Importer can also be used to correct and import locally acquired DICOM
 objects that were rejected by VistA due to patient and/or study 
 identification information mismatch.
  
 Ordered studies already have corresponding order request information on 
 the local VistA system.  An example of an ordered study is the contracted
 study which is ordered in the VA but is performed at an outside facility
 for a fee.  The locally acquired DICOM study that has erroneous patient
 and/or study identification information may be another example of an
 ordered study.  The Importer handles ordered studies for both Radiology
 and Consults.  DICOM modality worklist is used to identify the ordered
 study on VistA and download the corresponding patient and study
 identification information needed to update the data elements in the DICOM
 images so that they can be automatically associated with the original 
 study on VistA and be imported.
  
 Unordered studies are those that are unknown to the local VistA system.  
 An example of an unordered study is one that was performed while the
 patient was being treated at an outside institution, such as a DoD
 Military Treatment Facility, and was sent to the local VA when the patient
 was going to be transferred for treatment there.  The Importer
 automatically creates a corresponding Radiology Study on VistA for each
 unordered Radiology study and then uses the VistA patient and study
 identification information for the imported DICOM objects.  It is assumed
 that the patient is already registered on the local VistA system. (This 
 automatic ordering capability is not supported for Consults.)
  
 DICOM negotiation requests now require known Called Application Entity
 Titles so that acceptable presentation contexts in SCP_LIST.DIC can be
 properly identified. There is a new Application Entity Title dictionary
 (AE_TITLE.DIC) to facilitate this. The Called Application Entity Title for
 a DICOM request must either be the VistA Application Entity Title name for
 the SCP defined in SCP_LIST.DIC (for example, "VistA_Storage ) or else one
 defined in AE_TITLE.DIC as an alias for the VistA one.  Otherwise, the
 DICOM negotiation request will be rejected.

 Installation 
 ============
  
 Installation Planning
 =====================
  
 When planning the installation of Patch 53, the following factors should 
 be considered.
  
  * This patch is to be installed on the VistA System and on all DICOM 
    Gateways. KIDS installation will take less than five minutes. DICOM 
    Gateway installation will take 5 - 30 minutes based on workstation 
    hardware.
  * Radiology RA*5.0* 90 must be installed on the VistA System as a 
    prerequisite for VistA Imaging MAG*3.0*53.
  * The KIDS portion of Patch 53 must be installed on the VistA System 
    before installing Patch 53 on the DICOM Gateway.
  * Users may remain on the system during the KIDS installation.
  * Setting up the Outside Imaging Locations will require coordination 
    with the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine ADPAC.  A Radiology ADPAC should
    perform modifications to the Radiology Division and Imaging Location 
    Files, prior to importing studies for the first time.  (Refer to the 
    appropriate documentation in MAG3_0P53_Outside_Imaging_Location.pdf.)
  * The new Application Entity Title dictionary (AE_TITLE.DIC) must be 
    populated with all Called Application Entity Titles that are not the 
    VistA Application Entity Title name for the SCP (defined in
    SCP_LIST.DIC) and aliased to the VistA ones.  Otherwise the DICOM
    negotiation will be rejected.
  
 All of the installation instructions in this document should be reviewed 
 before beginning installation.
  
 Installation Prerequisites
 ==========================
  
 Before installing this patch, create a backup copy of current dictionary 
 (.dic) files. 
  
 NOTE Also correct any failed images that may be present.  See
 Chapter 7 in the VistA Imaging DICOM Gateway User Guide for detailed
 information. 
  
 NOTE It is required that all released VistA Imaging patches (KIDS) be 
 installed on the VistA System.
  
 Patch installation files can be downloaded from the Imaging FTP site.  
 All instructions in this section presume that files for this patch have
 been copied to a local storage location and not be installed from a
 network drive.  Files included with this patch are listed in the Data
 Dictionary Section.
  
 Laurel Bridge DICOM Server Runtime License
 ==========================================
  
 A license key has to be purchased for the Laurel Bridge DCF Local Server 
 Run-time DICOM software used by the Importer application.  For information
 about getting a license contact your site Implementation Manager.
  
 How the License Works
 =====================
  
 Each computer where the Importer application is installed will require a 
 separate license.  Because the license is keyed to the computer s MAC
 address, the license cannot be transferred from one computer to another.  
 As a result, the Laurel Bridge software will no longer function if the
 network card or if the entire computer is replaced.  In these situations,
 Laurel Bridge needs to be contacted in order to a transfer the license to
 the new system and get a new key.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Pre-Installation
 ====================================
  
 The following are a set of instructions to prepare to install Patch 53:
  
 Obtain the software from the Imaging FTP folder; the files to be 
 downloaded are itemized in an earlier section. The time needed to download
 these files is dependent on the WAN activity; normally it will take a
 couple of minutes.  Be sure to download using the ASCII switch, not the
 binary transfer method.
  
 The KIDS file can be installed with users on the system and will take 
 less than 5 minutes.
  
 NOTE In general, it is a good idea to schedule the installation of a 
 patch for a time when
  
  * Adequate support resources are available
  * System load is expected to be low
  
 NOTE Before proceeding with the installation, familiarize yourself with 
      the instructions in the VistA DICOM Gateway Installation Guide. The
      instructions below are merely abbreviated reminders that assume that 
      the complete instructions from the Installation Guide are known.
      Specifically, be sure to follow the instructions from the
      Installation Guide to uninstall prior versions of external products
      before attempting to install software on a DICOM Gateway.
  
 Pre-Installation Requirement(s)
 ===============================
  
 RA*5.0*90 and MAG*3.0*54 are required to be installed before installing 
 this patch. Please refer to the RA*5.0*90 Patch description for complete
 details.
