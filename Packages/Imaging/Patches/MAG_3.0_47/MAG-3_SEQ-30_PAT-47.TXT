Subject: Imaging API for Medicine Report Conversion

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VistA Imaging is currently storing pointers from image records in the
 IMAGE file (2005) to Medicine reports stored in the Medicine package.  
 There are also pointers stored in the Medicine reports files to the image
 records in the IMAGE file (2005).   Clinical Procedures is releasing
 MD*1.0*5 to allow sites to convert existing Medicine report text into TIU
 documents and display these documents on the Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS) Reports tab. Imaging patch MAG*3.0*47 provides an
 Application Programmer Interface (API) that will enable the CP conversion
 application to re-point the image records from Medicine reports to the new
 TIU documents generated by the CP conversion application.
  
 Sites only need to install this KIDS package.  No other Imaging related
 actions are required.   This API is being released by Imaging as a
 stand-alone patch with no dependencies. 
  
 NOTE  Do not install this patch at test sites running the VistA Imaging 
 v2.5 consolidation software.
  
 Any late-breaking information will be documented in a readme text file.
