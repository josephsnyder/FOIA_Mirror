Description:
============

  
 VistA Imaging patch MAG*3*25 contains enhancements and fixes to the
 functionality introduced in Patch 17. Patch 17 added "index" fields
 to key files in the Imaging System and provided a conversion tool to 
 populate these fields.
  
 Patch 25 adds an additional index field, provides an updated version of
 the conversion tool, and contains enhancements and corrections to the
 conversion process (to be performed after Patch 25 installation).
  
 Proper implementation of Patch 25 will ensure that patient images are 
 categorized in a consistent manner from site to site. Future patches will
 rely on the fields introduced in Patch 25.
  
 **********************************************************************
 Note for sites that have started or performed the Patch 17 conversion:  
 **********************************************************************
 Installing Patch 25 will clear any pre-existing index field values. The 
 conversion tool will need to be rerun against all Image file entries 
 after installing Patch 25. (The speed of the conversion process 
 (especially the commit step) has been dramatically improved.)
  
 Note: Do not install this patch if your site is a test site for the 
 VistA Imaging v2.5 consolidation software.

 document before implementing this patch. The Image Index Conversion Tool
 chapter explains the indexing to take effect on the Imaging files. Please
 review this section of the documentation thoroughly.
  
  
 2) The patch 25 conversion process will need to be coordinated by a site's
 IRM personnel, and will need to be evaluated and approved by a site's
 Clinical ADPAC.  Additional clinical staff may also need to be consulted
 to evaluate the appropriateness of mapping results.
