Description:
============

 This patch installs the TeleReader Configurator application. 
 
 The TeleReader application included in VistA Imaging Patch 46 (MAG*3.0*46) was
 configured using VA FileMan at each VistA Implementation.  Patch 114 provides 
 a GUI based interface to configure the TeleReader.  The application gives the 
 user some extra direction, help and data validation before making changes to 
 records within the VistA database.
 
 The TeleReader Configurator is a Microsoft Windows based GUI application. There 
 will be no additional business rules with the addition of this new interface. 
 
 This patch includes a KIDS package update.

 Installation:
 =============
 This patch is to be installed on the VistA System and on a site administrator 
 workstation.  The TeleReader Configurator is not meant to be installed on 
 clinical workstations.
 
 This patch may be loaded while VistA Imaging System is active.  Installation 
 will take less than one minute.
 
 NOTE   The application will prompt the user with the database configuration 
 screen only once. Upon successful login the entered values are stored in 
 MagTeleReaderConfig.ini, located in the same folder as the .exe. From that 
 point on the application will automatically connect to the server and port 
 listed in the MagTeleReaderConfig.ini. To connect to a different VistA database,
 open the file (default is Microsoft Notepad).  There will be a Login Options 
 section as listed below:
 
 [Login Options]
 Local VistA=localhost
 Local VistA port=9300
 
 Edit the Local VistA = entry with the desired server.
 
 Edit the Local VistA port = entry with the server port.
 
 Save the changes. When the application runs, it will connect to the server and 
 port entered in MagTeleReaderConfig.ini.
