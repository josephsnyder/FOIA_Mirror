  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Please see the Installation Considerations section below for
 requirements for installing patch 24. 
 
 This patch, MAG*3.0*24, contains the following enhancements and fixes
 to the Clinical Imaging Display and Capture software:
  
 1.  The default resolution of scanned documents is now
 300x300dpi instead of 200x200dpi.
  
 2.  Thin client, resolution, and color depth checks are now
 done prior to each image being opened.  Previously, the check was
 only done when the application was launched.  A minimum
 resolution of 1024x768 with 24bit color depth is required to view
 anything other than documents, EKGs and photo IDs.  If the user tries to
 view an image and does not meet these requirements, a dialog pops up and
 notifies the user that the image is blocked from view.  A warning
 message related to possible performance issues is also displayed each time 
 a user logs into the VistA Imaging Display application from a thin 
 client or a PC running thin client software.
  
 3.  The EKG Display window is replaced with a new user
 interface and several new features.  The EKG Display window
 now allows users to view EKGs on multiple MUSE servers and/or
 multiple MUSE sites.  It also allows viewing of multiple EKGs
 simultaneously.  The EKG Display window will now display clear
 indicators when an EKG report is unconfirmed.   Use the online
 help option in the EKG Viewer window to get a full list of EKG
 enhancements in this patch.
  
 Note: Do not install this patch if your site is a test site for the VistA
 Imaging v2.5 consolidation software.

 Installation Considerations:
 ============================
 
 The normal 30 day requirement for installing patches will be 
 extended to 90 days for Patch 24.   Because of recent issues with 
 computer viruses, many sites have had to divert IT resources to
 patching and cleaning their workstations and file servers.
 Therefore they have not had enough time to install new workstations and 
 thin clients that meet the minimum display resolution and color depth 
 requirements (1024x768 - 24 bit).  Sites that have experienced these delays 
 have several choices related to their implementation strategy.
 
 All sites should install the Patch 24 KIDS package immediately.  Either 
 Patch 2 or Patch 24 version clinical workstation software will operate with
 the Patch 24 KIDS package.   
 
 Sites may use their discretion related to which of their workstations should 
 have the new Clinical Workstation Patch 24 updates installed.  For example:
  
 - Sites should install the Patch 24 clinical workstation software on all
 PCs that are capable of meeting the minimum display requirements.
 
 - Sites should install the Patch 24 clinical workstation software on all
 capture workstations.  This will provide 300x300dpi document scanning
 default resolution.
 
 - Sites that use thin client stations may choose to install the Patch 24
 clinical workstation software only on servers that serve thin clients that
 meet the minimum display requirements.  Other servers would continue
 to run Patch 2 clinical workstation software.
 
 We encourage sites to install the Patch 24 software on as many systems 
 as possible so that users will have access to the new functionality and so
 that feedback can be provided to VistA Imaging.
  
  
 Installation Steps:
 ====================
  
 Install the KIDS package on the VistA Server:
  
       1. Access the Kernel Installation and Distribution System
          Menu [XPD MAIN].
       2. Run the Installation option.
       3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps.
           a.  Run the (1) Load a Distribution option to load the
               KIDS distribution.
           b.  When prompted, enter the path and file name of the
               Patch 24 KIDS file (MAG3_0P24.KID)that you
               downloaded from the Imaging FTP server.
           c.  When prompted to continue with the load, enter YES.
               A Distribution OK! message will be displayed when
               the load is complete.
       4. After you load the KIDS file, you may elect to use the
          following KIDS options.
           (2) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - run this
               option if you want to ensure the integrity of the
               routines in the patch.
           (4) Compare Transport Global to Current System - run
               this option if you want to view all changes that
               will be made when the patch is installed.  All
               components (routines, options, and so on) in the
               patch will be compared.
           (5) Backup a Transport Global - run this option if you
               want to create a backup message of any routines exported
               with the patch.  It will NOT back up any of the other
               changes.
      5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps,
         install the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
           a.  Run the (6) Install Package(s) option.
           b.  When prompted for the install name, enter MAG*3.0*24
           c.  Answer NO to the following prompts:
  
         Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO
         Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
  
  
 CLIENT INSTALLATION
 ===================
  
 Instructions for manual installation of MagSetup3_0P24.exe are located in 
 the VistA Imaging Installation Guide, Section 2.5.4.
  
 Instructions for automatic distribution of MagSetup3_0P24 to all Imaging 
 workstations are located in the VistA Imaging Installation Guide, 
 Section 2.5.5.
  
 To confirm that the correct version of the software is installed, choose 
 Help|About and verify that the version number is 3.0.24.5. 
  
 When configuring thin clients, be sure that the Window Size property
 (under ICA Window Properties) is set to Full Screen instead of explicitly
 setting it to 1024x768.  If you set it to 1024x768, you will only yield
 around a 1024x760 resolution. This is because the ICA window's title bar 
 and the Windows Start bar of the client take up a portion of the screen.
