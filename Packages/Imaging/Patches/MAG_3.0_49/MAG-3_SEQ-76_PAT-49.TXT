Subject: HL7 ADT TRANSMISSION TO COMMERCIAL PACS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other

Description:
============

 Commercial PACS have standardized on the use of HL7 for the transmission
 of patient demographics, patient movements, radiology orders, and 
 radiology reports. Patch 49 defines HL7 standardized communications
 between VistA Imaging and a receiving PACS (Picture Archive and
 Communication System). The new HL7 interfaces implement the HL7 order and
 patient update transactions in the IHE Radiology Scheduled Workflow
 Profile. 
  
 Use of the VistA Imaging Patch 49 (MAG*3.0*49) and the corresponding 
 Radiology Patch 47 (RA*5.0*47) will provide improved quality of 
 information over the current Class III HL7 interfaces that transfer data
 from the VistA System. It is expected that the use of Patches 49/47 will
 allow all sites to retire Class III software that is now used to obtain
 information via HL7. The new HL7 messages will also replace the now
 obsolete DICOM messages sent to the PACS by the VistA Imaging DICOM
 Gateway.
  
 Commercial vendors of HL7 interfaces (in particular, imaging, PACS, and
 voice recognition systems) are being requested to test and validate 
 products currently sold to the VA with Patches 49/47. Testing will ensure
 that these products will continue to operate properly and that they make
 use of the new information available with the release of these patches. It
 is expected that the use of Patches 49/47 will be mandated to ensure
 better identification of patients and patient data, providing a
 significant improvement in safety, reliability, and interoperability.
 Vendors should be encouraged to participate in the testing and validation
 of HL7 interfaces with this software as soon as possible. Please direct
 any questions to the mail group: VHA VI DICOM Validation (VHA VI DICOM
 Validation@va.gov).
  
 Patch 49 defines HL7 standardized patient registration communications 
 between VistA Imaging and a receiving PACS system. Each of these messages
 will be triggered by a patient event in the VistA PIMS (Patient
 Information Management Service) Package.
  
 The Patient Registration profile conveys the patient demographic and 
 visit information that was captured at the point of encounter. This
 transaction is used both for inpatients and outpatients.
  
 The Patient Update profile conveys changes to patient information, 
 including demographics, patient identification, patient location/class
 changes, and patient merges. These changes may occur at any time for a
 patient record. This transaction is used both for inpatients and
 outpatients.
  
 It is expected that the site be familiar with the operation of the VistA 
 HL7 Package and with the options that it makes available for defining and
 inspecting message queues. All messaging will be handled through the VistA
 HL7 Package and will occur entirely in the background without active user 
 intervention.
  
 The Accession Number has a new format, which includes a 3-digit site 
 prefix (SSS). The old format was MMDDYY-NNNNN. It included only the date
 (MMDDYY) and the case number (NNNNN). The new format is: SSS-MMDDYY-NNNNN.
 The national Integration Control Number also is included in this
 interface. Additional patient information that describes the patient, for
 example, the Patient Height, Weight, and Confidentiality, is available to
 improve patient safety. To support of radiology coordination, technician
 comments, and a call back number is passed from VistA to PACS and Voice
 Recognition Systems.
  
 The Study Instance UID is the attribute that labels all of the DICOM 
 objects that are created during the course of a study. In order to
 uniquely identify studies between the HIS, RIS, and PACS, the Integrating
 the Healthcare Enterprise Radiology Technical Framework have specified an
 HL7 ZDS segment to convey the Study Instance UID. This segment is
 inserted into the HL7 ORM order message after the OBR segment. All DICOM
 systems that receive these HL7 messages should use the Study Instance UID
 in the new HL7 ZDS segment.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 that have implemented DICOM Gateways
 must install both the KIDS portion on their VistA system and the client
 portions of this patch on all relevant client systems.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
  
 NOTE: Refer to the MAG3_0P49_Patch_Description.pdf document for detailed
       installation instructions.
  
 Before installing this patch, you will need to download the Patch 49 files
 from the Imaging FTP site to a local storage location. In general, it is a
 good idea to schedule the installation of a patch for a time when adequate
 support resources are available and when system load is expected to be 
 low.
  
 Before installing the client portion of Patch 49 on a DICOM Gateway, all
 activity on that DICOM Gateway being updated must be stopped. Other DICOM
 Gateways present can remain active. Client installation should take about
 10 to 30 minutes per gateway.
  
 It is required that all released VistA Imaging Patches be installed prior
 to the installation of VistA Imaging Patch 49.
  
 RA*5.0*47 is required to be installed on VistA before MAG*3.0*49.
  
 The following are a set of instructions to install Patch 49:
 ===========================================================
  
 Obtain the software from the Imaging FTP folder; the files to be 
 downloaded are itemized in an earlier section. The time needed to download
 these files is dependent on the WAN activity; normally it will take a
 couple of minutes.
  
 The KIDS file can be installed with users on the system and will take less
 than 5 minutes. 
  
 NOTE  In general, it is a good idea to schedule the installation of a 
       patch for a time when:
  
       * Adequate support resources are available
       * System load is expected to be low
  
 NOTE  This section describes the basic steps you need to install this 
       patch on an existing DICOM Gateway installation. The instructions in
       this section assume familiarity with the VistA DICOM Gateway
       Installation Guide, which contains complete details about installing
       the VistA System and the DICOM Gateway.
  
 NOTE  The installation of the KIDS package typically takes less than a 
       minute. The installation of the InstallShield package on the DICOM 
       Gateways may vary, depending on the characteristics of the 
       computer. During testing, "old and slow  computers took almost half
       an hour, and "new and fast  computers took less than five minutes.
  
 NOTE  Install Patch 49 on the DICOM Text Gateway(s) immediately after the 
       KIDS package is installed on VistA. The software can be installed on
       the other Gateways as is convenient.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation:
 ================================
  
 NOTE  Please pay particular attention to the boxes labeled PACS 
       CONFIGURATION NOTES in the following sections. They contain
       important information about values that you will need to make sure
       are configured within your commercial PACS product.
  
 Installing the KIDS Package:
 ===========================
  
 1  Access the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
  
 2  Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
  
 3  Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
  
    a Run the Load a Distribution [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] option to load 
      the KIDS distribution.
    b When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P49.KID) of the 
      Patch 49 KIDS file that you downloaded from the Imaging FTP server.
    c When prompted to continue with the load, enter YES.
  
      A Distribution OK! message will be displayed when the load is 
      complete.
  
 4  After you load the KIDS file, you may elect to use the following 
    options:
  
    a Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM]   Run this 
      option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the 
      patch.
    b Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM]   
      Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made 
      when the patch is installed. All components (routines, options, and
      so on) in the patch will be compared.
    c Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP]   Run this option if you want 
      to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch.
      It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
  
 5  After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install 
    the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
  
    a Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
    b When prompted for the install name, enter MAG*3.0*49.
    c Answer NO to the following prompts:
  
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//<Enter>
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//<Enter>
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? 
 NO//<Enter>
  
 When installation completes, a message that the patch is installed will 
 be displayed.
