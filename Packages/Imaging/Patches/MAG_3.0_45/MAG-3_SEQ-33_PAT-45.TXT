Subject: TeleOphthalmology Remote Image Views

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This enhancement to the VistA Imaging Display software allows 
 diagnosticians and referring physicians to view any of a patient's images 
 (including prior or related studies) that are stored at any VA medical 
 facility without the requirement of logging in to the remote system.  The 
 Image Listing Window will show all image studies for the selected patient 
 that are available at any VA site where that patient was treated.  The 
 user may select a study, and view the images for that study using the Full
 Resolution and Radiology viewing windows.  Operation of the client is
 essentially unchanged from previous patches, except for the ability to 
 access remote images.  An additional feature for telemedicine allows 
 images to be prefetched to the workstation prior to viewing.  The Remote 
 Image View capability will be used by the Teleretinopathy Screening 
 Readers.
  
 Patch 45 contains the following new functions and features:
 - Users can view all studies for a particular patient, no matter which site 
   acquired the images.
 - Users can select a study from a remote site for viewing from the list of all 
   studies.
 - Users can view the remote images in the same fashion as local ones using the 
   clinical workstation Clinical Display software.
 - The Clinical Display client automatically connects to remote sites using the 
   users local credentials.
 - Remote images are automatically loaded from all sites the patient has visited
   that has images. - Images are sorted by date/time in the Image List
   window and the Abstract window.
 - Users can view Image Information, Advanced Image Information, and Reports for
   remote images.
 - Users are prevented from deleting remote images.
 - Image filters can be applied to both local and remote images.
 - There is a new toolbar in the Display client that indicates what sites the 
   patient has been seen at and how many images the patient has at that site.
 - There is a new button on the Display client that allows the user access to a 
   status dialog of Remote Image Views and user preferences.
 - Remote Image Views auto-connect functionality can be turned off if the user 
   wishes.
 - The user can decide to auto-connect to sites in their local VISN (Veterans 
   Integrated Service Network) only if they wish.
 - The user can manually connect or disconnect a remote site.
 - The user can print or copy a remote image in the same manner as done for local
   images.
 - The imaging site abbreviation is now displayed on all images regardless of 
   where the image is from.
 - Version checking is extended to each remote site the user connects to.  Each 
   remote site must have a proper version of Imaging installed to ensure the 
   correct patient information is retrieved.  Sites with out-of-date versions of
   Imaging will not be used.
 - Remote abstracts are viewable as a user preference.
 - A user can manually queue images to be cached on the users local machine
 - The status of manually queued images appears in the Image List window in the 
   form of a traffic light.
 - Patch 45 properly works with Imaging Patch 59 remote sites.
 - VistA Site Service can be disabled in the VistA database.
 - VistA Site Service URL is stored in the local VistA database.
 - Patch 45 will not connect to DOD sites.
 - Patch 45 is able to quickly connect remote sites from the Remote Image Views 
   toolbar.
  
 Patch 45 corrects problems so that:
 - If the Radiology Viewer has cached an image, it will load the image from the 
   cache.
 - The Display client will correctly view abstract images in the Image 
   Information dialog.  
 - Abstract caching does not throw an exception if the abstract does not exist 
   on the network share.
 - Radiology viewer does not close when switching studies in CPRS (Computerized 
   Patient Record System).
