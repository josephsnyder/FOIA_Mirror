Description:
============

 This patch is being distributed with 5 new options, 1 main menu option 
 and 4 report options, 4 new sort templates and 4 new print templates.  It 
 will also add a new 'AD' cross reference to the DATE/TIME IMAGE SAVED 
 (#7) field in the IMAGE AUDIT (#2005.1) file.  The four reports will 
 provide the capability for Health Information Management and/or the 
 scanning unit to obtain statistics from the IMAGE (#2005) file.  They are 
 located on the new Imaging Site Reports [MAG REPORT MENU] menu under 
 Imaging System Manager Menu [MAG SYS MENU] and can be assigned as a 
 secondary option to the appropriate HIMs specialist requiring the reports.
  
 The following are the four new reports:
  
 1.  Document Count [MAG REPORT 2]: This is a report of the Image file 
 (#2005) with images having an Image Type of 'DOCUMENT'.  A 'From' and 
 'To' Acquisition Site and 'From' and 'To' Date/time Image Saved will be 
 asked.  Output includes:  Date/Time Image Saved, Object Type (DOCUMENT), 
 Type Index, and Image Saved By. There will be a total of the count of 
 images that meet the sort criteria.
  
 2.  Image Type Count by User [MAG REPORT 1]: This is a report of the 
 Image file (#2005) of Image Types for a 'From' and 'To' Acquisition Site' 
 and a 'From' and 'To' Date/Time Image Saved date range.  The report will 
 give totals for each Object Type, for each user, within date range.  A 
 grand total of images within the  date range is given at the end of the 
 report.
  
 3.  MEANS TEST [MAG REPORT 4]: This is a report of the Image file (#2005) 
 sorted by 'From' and 'To' Acquisition  Site and 'From' and 'To' Date/Time 
 Image Saved date range, and Type Index = MEANS TEST.  Report detail will 
 include: Patient Name, SSN, Descriptive Category,  Date/Time Image Saved, 
 and Export Location.
  
 4.  Package Index Contains 'Note' [MAG REPORT 3]: This is a report of the 
 Image file (#2005) sorted by 'From' and 'To' Acquisition Site and 'From' 
 and 'To' Date/Time Image Saved date range, Short Description, and Package 
 index containing 'NOTE'.  Report detail will include: Patient Name, SSN, 
 Short Description, Date/Time Image Saved, and Image Saved by.  Sub-counts 
 and counts are given per Scanned By, with Short Description, within 
 Patient.
  
 Patch 77 adds an 'AD' cross reference to the Date/Time Image Saved field (#7) 
 in the Image file (#2005) and the Image Audit file (#2005.1).
