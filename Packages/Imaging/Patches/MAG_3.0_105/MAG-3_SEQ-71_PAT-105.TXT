Description:
============

 Patch 105 Overview:
 ===================
  
 This document describes Patch 105, the VistA Imaging Advanced Web Image 
 Viewer (AWIV) for VistAWeb patch.
 It is part of the Joint Incentive Funds (JIF) 3 Wounded Warrior Initiative. 
 This patch is the first step towards supporting the congressionally mandated 
 exchange of non-radiology images between the VA and the DoD.
  
 When implemented, the VistA Imaging (AWIV) will let VistAWeb  users locate
 and display VA images associated with progress notes and radiology
 reports. 
  
 NOTE:  The VistA Imaging AWIV is designed for use with VistAWeb only. The 
         AWIV is not a stand-alone application.
  
 NOTE:  The AWIV is not intended for the primary interpretation of radiology 
         exams. When the AWIV is installed on approved and properly 
         maintained hardware, primary interpretation of other image types is 
         permissible by licensed practitioners at their discretion.
  
 NOTE:  The AWIV will not be available until VistAWeb version 13 is released.

 Patch 105 Changes:
 ==================
  
 Patch 105 contains the new VistA Imaging AWIV and a KIDS file used to 
 register the AWIV in the REMOTE APPLICATION File (#8994.5). This patch 
 affects no other Imaging components.
  
 AWIV Overview:
 ==============
  
 The VistA Imaging AWIV adds image display capabilities to VistAWeb in much 
 the same way that the Clinical Display application adds image display 
 capabilities to CPRS.
  
 With the AWIV, a user can display images associated with progress notes or 
 radiology reports within the VistAWeb application.
  
 To display remote images in VistAWeb, refer to the patch description 
 document MAG3_0p105_Patch_desc.pdf.
  
 AWIV Implementation:
 ====================
  
 The VistA Imaging AWIV is an ActiveX control that can only be launched from 
 VistAWeb in a VA-approved version of Microsoft Internet Explorer. VistAWeb 
 performs all user authentication and patient sensitivity checking. When 
 VistAWeb launches the AWIV, VistAWeb includes identifiers for the images to 
 be displayed in the parameters it passes to the AWIV.
  
 The AWIV in turn uses those parameters to locate remotely stored images via 
 the Centralized VistA Imaging Exchange (CVIX) service.  The CVIX, on 
 receiving image requests from the AWIV, pulls the images in question from 
 the applicable remote VA site and passes them back to the AWIV.  The CVIX 
 caches images that it handles to speed any subsequent requests for the same 
 images.
  
 AWIV Image Access Logging:
 ==========================
  
 Image access using the AWIV is logged in the CVIX transaction log and in the 
 IMAGE ACCESS LOG File (#2006.95) of the site where images originate from.
  
 VistA System Changes:
 =====================
  
 The KIDS file for patch 105 will add a new entry for the AWIV into the 
 REMOTE APPLICATION File (#8994.5). There are no other changes made to VistA 
 for this patch.
  
 Data Dictionaries:
 ==================
  
 There are no new or modified data dictionaries in this patch.
  
 Security Keys:
 ==============
  
 There are no new or modified security keys in this patch.
  
 Remote Procedures:
 ==================
  
 There are no new or modified remote procedures in this patch.
  
 Menu Options:
 =============
  
 There are no new or modified menu options in this patch.
  
 Installation:
 =============
  
 The Patch 105 KIDS must be installed on the VistA System. The KIDS can be 
 installed while VistA Imaging is active. KIDS installation will take less 
 than one minute.
  
 The AWIV component is intended for use on workstations that have access to 
 VistAWeb. Note that while VistAWeb itself is installed on a central 
 application server, the AWIV is an Active X control that needs to be 
 installed on the local workstation either manually or using an automated 
 software distribution system. AWIV installation will take less than one 
 minute per workstation.
  
 NOTE:  The AWIV should not be installed on thin client workstations.
  
 Installation Prerequisites:
 ===========================
  
 Before installing this patch, you will need to download the Patch 105 files 
 from the Imaging FTP site to a local storage location.
  
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section have been 
 installed.
  
 Workstations where the AWIV is installed must meet the following minimum 
 requirements:
  
      * Access to VistAWeb version 13 (WEBV*1*20) or later
  
      * A VA-approved version of  Microsoft Internet Explorer
  
      * Display capability of 24-bit color with a screen resolution of

        on the local workstation. 
  
      * There are no configurable installation options.
  
 Automated Installation:
 =======================
  
 The AWIV installation file can be pushed to individual workstations using 
 applications such as PSexec or Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS). 
 Specifics will vary depending on the automated installation tool used.
  
 Manual Installation:
 ====================
  
 Use the following steps to install the VistA Imaging AWIV software. 
  
 1.  On the workstation where the AWIV will be installed, log into an 
     administrator-level account.
  
 2.  Double-click MagAWIVInstall.exe to start the installation wizard. There 
     will be a brief delay as the installation files are extracted.
  
 3.  When the Welcome page appears, click Next.
