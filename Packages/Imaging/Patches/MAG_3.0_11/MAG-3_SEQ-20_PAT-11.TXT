Description:
============

 VistA Imaging patch, MAG*3*11, will transition the DICOM Gateway's from 
 Distributed Data Processing (DDP) dependency to utilizing the Kernel's 
 'M[UMPS]-to-M[UMPS] Broker' connectivity introduced in Kernel patch 
 XWB*1.1*28 SEQ #24. In this configuration, the DICOM Gateway will operate 
 as client, requesting the execution of RPC calls on the Vista HIS 
 servers. This method offers more flexibility in terms of controlling 
 access to the server (the Broker employs standard VistA access 
 verification) and removes the onus from the client systems to keep their 
 translation tables up-to-date. In addition this patch provides support 
 for moving DICOM Gateways from Windows NT to the Windows 2000 Server or 
 XP Professional operating systems as mandated by VA's Secretary outlined 
 on December's 2003 VA Top Issues
 (http://vaww.vhaco.va.gov/vhacio/TopIssue.asp?id=634). This mandate is to 
 be met by May 31, 2004. The DICOM software will now run on either a 
 Windows 2000 or XP operating software. For more detail information on this
 patch and installation instructions review the MAG3_0P11_Patch_Desc.pdf
 file on the Imaging FTP server as well as the Imaging web page.
  
 DICOM Gateways changes:
 ============================== 
 The DICOM gateways software has been completely re-written to utilize the 
 M-to-M Broker. Installation of this software will require an initial 
 install and not just a restoration of routines and/or files on the DICOM 
 Gateway.  This patch will provide an executable that can be utilized to 
 install the Imaging software. Imaging is recommending installing this 
 patch on a clean Window's 2000 or Windows XP platform that should also 
 have an installation of the Micronetics NT MUMPS software prior 
 installation of the Imaging patch.
  
 The M-to-M connectivity is determined by setting DICOM Gateway 
 parameters. The menu option 'Update Gateway Configuration Parameters' 
 will specifically add a couple of new parameters to the database.  The 
 parameters below are required for the M-to-M connectivity. Details on the 
 'listener' setup can be acquired from the Kernel Infrastructure 
 documentation for patch (XWB*1.1*28).  Please note the following prompts
 for codes are for a 'service account' that is required to be setup on the
 VistA server using the Kernel User Management [XUSER] options.  The 
 account should not allow the access and verify codes to expire. 
  
 Enter IP address of VistA system
 Enter the Port Number on VistA system for the M-to-M Broker
 Enter a valid Access Code for your VistA system
 Enter the Verify Code for you VistA system
  
 Detailed instructions on the DICOM Site parameters can be located in the 
 DICOM Gateway Installation Guide.
