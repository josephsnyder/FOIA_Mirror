Subject: Import API Enhancements

Category:

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 VistA Imaging Patch 15 is being released in support of the PICS photo ID 
 application which is scheduled to be deployed in August 2004. 
  
 Patch 15 enhances the Imaging API capability that was released with Patch
 7.  The API was designed to allow external applications to call a
 programmer interface to have an image (or images) automatically imported
 into VistA Imaging.  The Patch 7 version of the API allowed an external
 application to call an RPC to queue an image for import.  The import queue
 was processed asynchronously by the Imaging Background Processor and the
 results of the import (success or failure) were reported back to the
 calling application through a callback mechanism.
   
 Patch 15 enhances this functionality by allowing an external application 
 to call the Import API through an ActiveX control. The ActiveX control is 
 compiled into and distributed as part of the external application.  When 
 the API is called through the ActiveX control, the import is processed 
 synchronously by the ActiveX control and immediate status feedback is 
 returned to the calling application.
  
                                
 NOTE    Do not install this patch if your site is a test site for VistA 
 Imaging v2.5 consolidation software.
  
 Patch Contents:
 ===============
 This patch includes the following files:
  
 MAG3_0p15_Patch_desc.pdf - Patch 15 description and installation 
           instructions.
  
 MAG3_0P15.KID - KIDS (Kernel Installation & Distribution System) package 
           to be installed on the VistA hospital information system.
  
 MAG3_0P15T3-API-OCX.exe - InstallShield package that contains the ActiveX 
           control, API SDK documentation and 2 sample Visual Basic
           applications. This package is only distributed to external
           application developers that need to send images to VistA Imaging
           for storage.  A signed integration agreement between the vendor
           and VistA Imaging is required before it is distributed.  The
           redistribution and registration of the ActiveX control is the
           responsibility of the external application owner/developer.
  
 PLEASE NOTE:
    The executable file listed above will not be available on the
