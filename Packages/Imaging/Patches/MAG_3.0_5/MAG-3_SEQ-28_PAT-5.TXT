Description:
============

 VistA Imaging patch 5, Storing DICOM Objects, is phase I in a process that
 will provide the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine)
 storage capability. For historical reasons, DICOM images processed by
 VistA have been converted into a text file (*.TXT, for the information in
 the DICOM header) and a Targa (TGA) format image file and stored in the
 database.  While the technique has worked well in the past when DICOM
 viewing software was not available, it is somewhat limited in that it
 doesn't support a number of DICOM capabilities (multi-frame images, color
 images, look up tables, imbedded thumbnail icons, etc.).  Now that VistA
 provides DICOM viewing software, the intent is to store the images as
 DICOM objects in VistA exactly as they are received.  The text file will
 continue to be used to redundantly hold the DICOM header information for
 easy retrieval.
  
 This capability will be added to VistA in (a minimum of) three stages.  
 With Patch 10, released November 2003, this DICOM storage was enabled for 
 non-radiology healthcare providers images (Dentistry, Ophthalmology, 
 Endoscopy, Cardiology, Pathology, etc.)  With this patch, MAG*3.0*5,  this
 capability is extended to Bone Densitometry, Ultrasound, and Nuclear 
 Medicine.  Later phases of this patch will expand this capability to more
 modalities. 
  
 This patch will consist of a Kernel Installation & Distribution System
 (KIDS) installation to record the patch in the Package file and a new
 version of the ELEMENT.DIC file for the DICOM Gateways. A full description
 of this patch can be obtained in MAG3_0P5_Patch_Description.PDF file.
  
 NOTE:   All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 that have implemented DICOM
 Gateways must install both the KIDS portion on their VISTA system and the 
 gateway portions of this patch on all relevant gateway systems.
  
 Vista Imaging 2.5 sites should not install this patch.
  
 This patch can be downloaded from:
 ==================================
 ftp.imaging.med.va.gov/software/released software/mag3_0p5
  
 This patch consists of the following files: 
  
 MAG3_0P5.KID -  KIDS application to be installed on hospital database.
  
 ELEMENT.DIC - A new version of the ELEMENT.DIC is distributed with this   
        patch and is required to enable the capabilities to store DICOM
        images in VistA.  The following five sequence elements will be
        added to ELEMENT.DIC in order to bring it closer to the 2004
        DICOM Standard:
        (0008,0096) Referring Physician Identification Sequence
        (0032,1031) Requesting Physician Identification Sequence
        (0040,000B) Scheduled Performing Physician Identification Sequence
        (0040,1011) Intended Recipients of Results Identification Sequence
        (0040,1101) Person Identification Code Sequence
        Two new modalities were added as well:
        OP = Ophthalmic Photography Series
        SMR = Stereometic Relationship
