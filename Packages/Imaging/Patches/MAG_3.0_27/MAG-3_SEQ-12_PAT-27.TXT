Description: 
============

 VistA Imaging patch MAG*3.0*27 is a re-release of Patch 19, which 
 introduced VistA Imaging's Site Usage Reporting functionality. Patch 
 27 correct problems found in Patch 19, and is to be installed 
 instead of Patch 19. 
  
 The Imaging Site Usage Reporting capability allows sites to create 
 Imaging Site Usage reports on demand.  New information in the report 
 includes statistics for:
  
 '  The total number of patient records displayed and captured
 '  VistARad usage
 '  The number of additions and deletions made in the IMAGE File (#2005)
 '  Advance Directive and Consent captures
 '  Number of images acquired via Clinical Capture and DICOM Gateways
  
 The Image Site Usage Report is also automatically generated on a monthly 
 basis and is used for the monthly VistA Imaging VISN Performance Monitor 
 Reports.
  
 Detailed patch information and installation instructions can be found in 
 the MAG3_0P27 Patch Description.
  
 Patch-related documentation will be available in the 
 \SOFTWARE\RELEASED_SOFTWARE folder on the Imaging FTP server, and will
 be posted at http:/vaww.va.gov/Imaging/3.0patches.htm. Any late-breaking 
 patch information will be documented in a readme file.
  
 Note: Do not install this patch if your site is a test site for VistA 
 Imaging v2.5 consolidation software.
