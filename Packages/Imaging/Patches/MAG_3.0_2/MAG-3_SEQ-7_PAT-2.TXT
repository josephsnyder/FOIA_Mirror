Subject: Display Check and Unconfirmed MUSE EKG Fix

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 This patch includes three updates to the Clinical Display Software.  These 
 updates are described below: 
 
 1.     Display Resolution and Color Depth Check - In accordance with the
 VHA Directive 2003-011, VA clinicians must have adequate display quality when 
 viewing medical images.  This patch will warn users when their display 
 resolution is below 1024x768 and/or their color depth is below 24 bit.  The 
 warning will indicate that the workstation display settings are not 
 sufficient to view medical images.  The user will be required to 
 acknowledge the warning and they will be allowed to continue to view the 
 images.  A future patch that will be issued October 2003 will block 
 the display of medical images when adequate display settings are not 
 detected. 
 2.     Thin Client Check - This patch will also warn users when they are 
 on a thin client workstation.  The warning will indicate that image 
 manipulation performance may not be adequate for viewing medical images.
 3.     Unconfirmed MUSE EKG Display - This patch fixes a problem that 
 existed when there were only unconfirmed EKGs in the MUSE server for a 
 patient. Previous versions of the VistA Imaging Display software would 
 indicate that there were 0 EKGs for the patient even though the patient had 
 unconfirmed EKGs in the MUSE database.
