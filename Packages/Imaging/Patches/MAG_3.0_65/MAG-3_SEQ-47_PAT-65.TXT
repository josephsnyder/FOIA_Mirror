Subject: VISTARAD MAINTENANCE IV

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This document describes Patch 65, the VistARad Maintenance IV patch. This
 patch corrects the following problems:
  
 * The software issue identified in Patient Safety Issue PSI-06-140 
   (VistARad Patch 18 MR Scout Images) has been resolved. 
  
 * The overall usability and stability of VistARad s voice dictation 
   interface has been improved.
  
     Note  Because of a change in how dictation settings are stored, the 
     dictation settings at a workstation will need to be re-entered after 
     the Patch 65 client software is installed.
  
 * Several hanging protocol issues related to mapping viewports and 
   splitting image sets using exam attributes have been resolved.
  
 * New logic has been added to allow VistARad to compensate for measurement 
   issues in certain types of CT and CR exams.
  
 * Numerous minor fixes have been made to the VistARad client software to 
   resolve bugs and improve usability.
  
 For detailed information, refer to the MAG3_0P65_Patch_Description.PDF file.
  
   NOTE  All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion
         of this patch. At sites that have implemented VistARad, 
         installation of both the KIDS and the client software is required;
         installation of the client software may be phased in according to
         each site s needs. See page 16 for notes about backward 
         compatibility.
  
   NOTE  Once the KIDS portion of Patch 65 is installed, users logging into
         the Patch 18 client will receive a warning message indicating that
         there is a difference between the client and host versions.  This
         message will be displayed at every logon until the Patch 65 client
         is installed; the Patch 18 client will continue to function
         normally.
  
 Terms of Use:
 ============

 To receive this patch, sites must have a Site Agreement filed with and 
 approved by the VistA Imaging Group.

 Remote Procedure Calls:
 ======================
  
 The following remote procedures are included in this patch:
  
 MAGD CR PARAMS

   PARAMETER file (#2006.623) for Pixel Spacing calculations.
  
 MAGD CT PARAMS
   New. Uses to return a history of Modality.dic settings (as stored in the

 Data Dictionaries:
 =================
  
 The following data dictionaries are included in this patch:
  
 #2006.621  MAG CT PARAMETER file: New file containing historical processing
            parameters used by a site s CT modalities. This file is used to
            store values needed for proper handling of CT images processed
            before the installation of Patch 50. (For images processed after
            Patch 50 is installed, appropriate processing parameters are
            stored in the image s .TXT file.). For information about viewing
            or modifying entries in this file, see the DICOM User Manual,
            section 10.6 (included with this patch).
  
 #2006.623  MAG CR PARAMETER file: New file used to correct measurement 
            problems for older Fuji CR images. Certain versions of the Flash
            IIP consoles software stored incorrect values in the newer 
            Imager Pixel Spacing field (0018,1164), whereas the older field
            (Pixel Spacing--0028,0030) still carried the correct value. Note
            that affected images may be identified as being from a different
            source (in the image s associated .txt file) than a Fuji CR if
            an intermediary device is present (for example, an DeJarnette
            ImageShare CR). For details, see the DICOM User Manual, section
            10.7 (included with this patch).
