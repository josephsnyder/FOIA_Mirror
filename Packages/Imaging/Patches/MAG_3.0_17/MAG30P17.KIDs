The Imaging File (2005) has many "imaging multiples" pointing to it from
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",19,0)
other packages such as Radiology, Medicine, Surgery, Mailman and the
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",20,0)
various sub-files of Laboratory such as Surgical Pathology etc.  In order
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",21,0)
to have a method of tracing back from the Image file to the parent file
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",22,0)
multiple, a file was developed to aid in this process, along with some
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",23,0)
additional fields in the Image file. Using these fields along with the
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",24,0)
PARENT DATA FILE, backward navigation is possible whether it be to a
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",25,0)
multiple of a file, or a multiple of a sub-file of a file. Each image that
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",26,0)
is captured is associated with a procedure or test report.  Depending on
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",27,0)
the service collecting the image, different types of reports will be
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",28,0)
associated.  For example:
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",29,0)
 
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",30,0)
  * Medical Procedures:  Endoscopy, Dermatology, Hematology, Rheumatology, etc.
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",31,0)
  * Anatomic Pathology:  Surgical Pathology, Cytology, Autopsy, Electron Microscopy
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",32,0)
  * Radiology:  Xray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",33,0)
  * Surgery  Operation reports
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",34,0)
  * Text Integration Utility  Progress notes
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",35,0)
 
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",36,0)
 In order to be able to display information from the associated
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",37,0)
report, references to that report are stored in the Image file. 
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",38,0)
One of these references is a pointer to the Parent Report file
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",39,0)
(2005.03), which contains an entry for each package's report file
"^DIC",2005.03,2005.03,"%D",40,0)
that is currently supported.
