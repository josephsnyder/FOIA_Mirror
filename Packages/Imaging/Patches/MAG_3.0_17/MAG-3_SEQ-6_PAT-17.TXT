Description: 
============

 VistA Imaging patch MAG*3*17 is the first phase for a future patch that
 will allow sorting and filtering on images.  Patch will convert the
 present Imaging file (#2005) by adding new 'indexes' to new key fields
 created by this patch. The new index fields will ensure that images are
 categorized in a consistent manner from site to site.  Future search and
 filter capabilities, to be introduced in Patch MAG*3*8, will rely on the
 fields introduced and populated in Patch 17.  For detailed patch 
 information and installation instructions, review the MAG3_0P17 Patch
 Description posted on the Imaging web page at
 http:/vaww.va.gov/Imaging/3.0patches.htm.
  
 This patch includes the following files:

 MAG30P17MAP.TXT - This file is the mapping scheme to be used for
 converting the present field values with predefined values for the new
 'index' fields.  This file will be read into the database and will create
 a working global that is editable on site during the conversion.
                                                                                 
 MAG30P71MAP.XLS - A spreadsheet presentation of the data in file
