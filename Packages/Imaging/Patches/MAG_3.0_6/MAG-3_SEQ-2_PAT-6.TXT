Description: 
============

 This patch provides some enhancements and bug fixes for the VistARad 
 workstation software; all of the modifications affect the Stack Viewer 
 display behavior.
  
 The patch consists of a single client workstation installation file, 
 Vistarad_setup.exe.
  
 We are mandated by FDA regulations to track Imaging software
 distribution.  The software will be available on the Imaging FTP directory
 under your site's folder.  Only sites that have their release agreements
 on file and have installed patch 1 (MAG*3.0*1) are candidates for
 receiving the software.  Please contact Kathy Trombetta to check the
 status of your site's release agreement. Kathy can be contacted via
 exchange mail or phone 301-734-0357.
  
 Test sites that are Beta testing Imaging Consolidation software should 
 not install this patch.

 Enhancements Provided:
 ============================ 
  
 Changed Stack Viewer to make it respond to the Enable Series Processing 
 option setting in the Manager.  When Enable Series Processing is ON, the 
 Stack Viewer will display exam series in separate stacks.  When OFF, the 
 Stack Viewer will display all exam series in a single stack.
  
 Added the capacity to the Stack Viewer to sort images within a series by 
 image location, or by image number.  The sort option can be selected by 
 the user from the Stack pull-down menu.  The selected sort will affect 
 all exams subsequently opened in the Stack Viewer-it will not re-sort an 
 exam that has already been opened.
  
 Note: the new image number sort corrects some problems that resulted in 
 image interleaving for certain types of studies.
  
 Added a new status line to each cell.  The new status line includes the 
 following fields:
         Slice Thickness (0018, 0050)
         Slice Location (0020, 1041)
         Contrast Indicator (0018, 0010)
  
 Modifications:
 ===================== 
  
 1) Change made to automatically show all cells actually occupied when a 
 new exam is loaded.
  
 2) Added a dual-function Set Layout button to the Stack Viewer toolbar.  
 The new button can be used in two ways:
       - When clicked, it allows the user to toggle between the last 
         user-specified layout and the "Show All Occupied Cells" setting.
       - As a "pull-down" control it allows the user to open a box used to 
         change the current layout.
  
 3) Fixed problem that prevented ROIs from being panned (moved) within a 
 cell.
  
 4) Corrected bug that caused stacks to scroll in the wrong direction 
 while dragging with the middle mouse button.
  
 5) Improved the algorithm used to calculate initial image window/level 
 when no window/level is specified from modality.
  
 Documentation:
 ==================== 
 The VistARad User's guide has been updated to include all enhancements 
 and modifications. The updated document is included in on-line help for 
 the client VistARad workstation software. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ============================ 
 Download the Vistarad_setup.exe from the Imaging FTP Sites folder for 
 download; the file is located in the sub-folder "Patch_6_VistARad" on 
 your site's folder.
  
 To install the patch, execute the setup file on the workstation, 
 selecting the "Repair" option (to update a previous version), or the 
 "Typical" option (for new installs).  Verify installation by viewing the 
 version of the software:  1) VistARad Manager--3.0.30;  2) VistARad 
 Viewer--3.0.15
  
  
 Note: Acrobat Reader version 4.0 or later is required for proper display 
 of the user guide; an installation file for Acrobat 5.0 was included on 
 the Imaging 3.0 Patch 1 CD.
