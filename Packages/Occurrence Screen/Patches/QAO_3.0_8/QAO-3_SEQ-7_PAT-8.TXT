Subject: CORRECT PROCESSING OF OS-109 DEATH SCREEN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the gathering of data for processing the OS-109 Death
 screen within the Occurrence Screening application.  Death entries 
 that should be printed on the OS-109 screen are not being picked up by the
 daily Tasked Run of Auto Enroll [QAM TASKED AUTO ENROLL RUN] job.

    REMEDY OVERVIEW:
    ================
   
    1) HD0000000064247 - TUA-0904-31880  Screen 109 is not printing
    
    Problem:
    --------
    Sites are reporting that death entries are not always being picked up
    by the daily Tasked Run of Auto Enroll [QAM TASKED AUTO ENROLL RUN]
    job. The job currently only picks up deaths entered the previous day
    before midnight. If the entry is made after midnight the death entry
    will not be picked up.
  
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine QAOC109 which processes discharges due to Death will be
    modified to review the prior day along with the current report date to
    report on prior day deaths entered after the auto enrollment run. It 
    will also be modified to verify and process those deaths that were not
    previously processed.
