 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD218845     Bene Travel Rates
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  There is a change in mileage rates and deductibles made by the 
  Secretary per authority of 38 USC 111 that needs to be distributed 
  to all sites by 02/01/08.  There is a restriction in the data 
  dictionary for the MAS EVENT RATES (#43.1) file of 2 decimal positions 
  on the Mileage and C&P Mileage reimbursement rates.  This needs to 
  support three (3) decimal positions.  The Chief Business Office has
  determined the ability of changing these rates at the sites must be 
  removed to ensure compliance.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Edited the MILEAGE RATE (#30.03) and C&P REVIEW VISIT MILEAGE RATE
  (#30.05) field's input transforms to allow three decimal positions.
  Created a post-install routine to insert the 02/01/08 rate structure
  into the MAS EVENT RATES (#43.1) file and modified the software to 
  properly handle the new rates. The DGBT BENE TRAVEL RATES option 
  was modified to exit after BT CERTIFYING OFFICIAL, COREFLS ACTIVE 
  and BT OTHER EXPENSES ASKED dialog.
  
  Rate structure for 02/01/08:
  MAS EVENT RATES (#43.1) file
      43.1,30.01 DEDUCTIBLE/VISIT              value 15.54
      43.1,30.02 DEDUCTIBLE/MONTH              value 46.62
      43.1,30.03 MILEAGE RATE                  value .285
      43.1,30.05 C&P REVIEW VISIT MILEAGE RATE value .285
