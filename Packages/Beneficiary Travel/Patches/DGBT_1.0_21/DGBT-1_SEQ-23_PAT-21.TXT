Description:
============

 This patch addresses 4 issues:
  
    1. A subscript error occurs when printing the "Standard Claims Output"
       report from the Report of Claim Amounts [DGBT BENE TRAVEL REPORT] 
       option.
  
    2. Entry cannot be processed since the seconds portion of the Claim
       DATE/TIME (#.01) field of the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file is 
       equal to or greater than 60.
  
    3. The CBO has requested that the Default Mileage be removed when using
       the Claim Enter/Edit [DGBT BENE TRAVEL SCREEN] option.
  
    4. When using the View of Claim [DGBT BENE TRAVEL VIEW] option, the 
       "Auth. Person" will show whoever is printing the report.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000064748 - CHY-0105-51424  SUBSCRIPT>PATU^DGBTOA2 errors on 
                      system
   
     Problem:
     --------
     A subscript error occurs when printing the "Standard Claims Output" report
     from the Report of Claim Amounts [DGBT BENE TRAVEL REPORT] option.       
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Added data validation to routine DGBTOA2 to prevent the subscript error
     from occurring. Since the Report is by division, if for some reason the
     DIVISION (#11) field of the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#192) file record 
     is blank (which should not be the case), then it will just not be 
     displayed (because the record would not be associated with a division).   
  
  
 2. INC000000435098 - Enrollment not updating, in-process status since April
   
     Problem:
     --------
     The lock function is incrementing the Claim DATE/TIME (#.01) field of the 
     BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file by 10 seconds. This could cause an 
     entry to become invalid, if more than 6 claims are entered, with the same
     date and time.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine DGBTE1 and DGBTEF to use the FileMan call $$FMADD^XLFDT 
     to properly increment the seconds portion of the time. Also, modified the
     lock functions to use incremental locks and DILOCKTM per 
     SACC requirement 2.4.6.1.
  
  
 3. INC000000718707 - Default Mileage deletion needed after BT Dashboard 
                             Implementation
  
     Problem:
     --------
     CBO has requested that the default mileage be removed, when entering
     a travel claim with the Claim Enter/Edit [DGBT BENE TRAVEL SCREEN] option.
     This is to ensure travel clerks use the Bene Travel Dashboard mileage for 
     all mileage claims.
        
        
     Resolution:
     -----------  
     Deleted all entries in the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL DISTANCE (#392.1) file
     to remove the default mileage from all mileage prompts. Old entries will 
     be stored in ^XTMP("DGBT1P21") for 90 days after installation. Also,
     deleted the menu option Distance Enter/Edit [DGBT BENE TRAVEL DISTANCES],
     and removed all references to this option from the user and technical
     manuals.
        
        
 4. INC000000848133 - Bene Travel - View Claim Auth. Person
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When accessing the View of Claim [DGBT BENE TRAVEL VIEW] option,
     the "Auth. Person" is displaying name of the current user. The 
     "Auth Person" should be displaying the clerk WHO ENTERED INTO THE
     FILE (#.12) field of the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------  
     Modified routine DGBTCDSP to display the correct clerk, from 
     WHO ENTERED INTO THE FILE (#.12) field of the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM
     (#392) file.
