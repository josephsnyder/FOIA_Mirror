Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 Note:  This patch is an emergency released with a 72-hour compliance.
  
 This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment System (ES)
 Discontinue Annual Means Test Renewal project.  DGBT*1*24 (Beneficiary
 Travel) is being released along with DG*5.3*858 (Registration), IVM*2*154
 (Income Verification Match), EAS*1*106 (Enrollment Application System),
 and IB*2*385 (Integrated Billing)in host file: DG_53_P858.KID.
  
 It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
 compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
 ************************************************************************* 
  
 The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
 Enrollment System (ES) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and
 Eligibility (VistA REE) software to support the requirements of the
 Discontinue Annual Means Test Renewal project.
   
 This patch modifies the Beneficiary Travel (BT) v1.0 application as 
 described below:
  
 1. Removes Means Test (MT) expiration related displays from the 
 Beneficiary Travel Claim Information <Screen 1> and the BT Alternate 
 Income Enter/Edit screens.  
  
 2. Where applicable, income information from the most recent Means Test
 will be displayed on the screen, and the MT Status fields will no longer
 display "EXPIRED" if the means test status date is older than the BT Claim
 date by more than 365 days.
  
 3. The new VFA Start Date field in MAS PARAMETERS file (#43) will 
 now be used as part of the determination of a "current" means test.

 Problem:
 -------
 1. Changes resulting from the Veterans Financial Assessment business 
 process will result in the discontinuation of the Veterans means test 
 expiration. The Beneficiary Travel software currently has in place a 
 check for means test expiration after one year from the means test 
 entry.  When this occurs, it causes the non-display of income data and 
 the display of an expiration message for a means test in both the
 Beneficiary Travel Claims Screen <1> and the BT Alternate Income 
 Enter/Edit screens.
  
 2. When displaying the Beneficiary Travel Claims Screen <1>, there is a 
 display within the Waiver information that shows the calculated means 
 test expiration date if the waiver software found one to be applicable. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 1. The software for the display of the means test information has been 
 modified to override the "EXPIRED" tag when a means test is available and 
 determined to be current under new VFA rules.  If a means test is found 
 that is now considered current, the associated income for that means test 
 will be displayed as well.  Information display for Low Income and 
 Alternate income cases is not impacted by this patch.
  
 2. When there is an applicable Waiver information display, if the waiver 
 is associated with a means test, expiration display is over-written with 
 "MEANS TEST DO NOT EXPIRE".
