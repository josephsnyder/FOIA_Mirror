 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  
  ==============
 1)  HD0000000210797     Can't run OSHA 300 Summary
  
 Problem: 
  --------
  User receives "Incomplete Data" while running the OSHA 300A Summary
  report even though the information is there and complete.
  
 Resolution:
  -----------
  When determining if there is complete information for the time period
  specified in the report, it calculates how many months the report is
  for and how many months were actually used in calculating the totals
  and if the numbers don't match it assumes there is incomplete data
  for at least one of the months.  The problem is, it sometimes
  calculates the number of months incorrectly, so I will modify the
  code to correctly identify the number of months in the reporting 
  period.
  
    
 2)  HD0000000130512     Problem with counting Days Away Column totals
                         and Restricted /Transfer days Column
   
 Problem: 
  --------
  While running the OSHA 300 Log, if an individual has two Incident
  Classifications on file and the first one is less than 180 and
  the second one brings the total to more than 180 it will display
  a value more than 180 when 180 is supposed to be the max value.
    
 Resolution:
  -----------
  Before adding the values together, I will verify the result is not
  greater than 180.  If it is, it will display a value of 180.
  
  
 3)  HD0000000156118     "restricted" days incorrect on OSHA log
     Duplicates:
     HD0000000222839  OSHA LOG reports 0 when FM shows field as 180
  
 Problem: 
  --------
  While running the OSHA 300 Log when an individual has been "Away from
  Work" or their "On Job Transfer/Restriction" days are equal to 180 days
  the report incorrectly displays a value of zero.  
    
 Resolution:
  -----------
  Add code to handle a value of exactly 180.
