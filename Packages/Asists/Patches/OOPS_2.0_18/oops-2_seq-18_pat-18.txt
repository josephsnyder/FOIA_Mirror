Subject: ALLOW FUTURE TERMINATION DATE IN LOOKUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Description:
 ============
  
 This patch contains a modification that will include a business rule in a
 different package that was not part of the functional requirements for 
 OOPS*2.0*15. ASISTS will now include individuals in the lookup when a case 
 is created if the termination date is blank or contains a date equal to 
 the current or a future date.
   
 This patch contains a new GUI that is being released to keep the server and 
 client components of ASISTS in synch.  There is no new functionality
 introduced in the GUI.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 
 1) HD0000000273646   
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    Either an employee or a non-paid employee with any termination date in the 
    New Person File (#200) would not be included in the list of individuals 
    who could have a new incident created for them.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Added logic that checks the TERMINATION DATE (#9.2) in the NEW PERSON
    file (#200) and if the date is blank, the current date, or a future date 
    the employee or non-paid employee will be included in the lookup list.
