Subject: OSHA 300 Column F modification

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VHA Medical Facilities have been receiving citations since 2006 concerning 
 OSHA recordkeeping requirements, specifically, incomplete data in Column F of 
 the OSHA 300 log.  Currently Column F on the OSHA Log is populated by using 
 ASISTS fields: TYPE OF INCIDENT (field #3) and BODY PART MOST AFFECTED (field 
 #30) from the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260).  OSHA states in their
 citations to VHA Medical Facilities that the OSHA 300 log does not adequately 
 describe the injury or illness, the parts of the body affected, or does not
 identify the object/Substance that directly injured or made the person ill.
  
 This patch contains a modification that will enable facilities to enter the 
 exact phrase that should be displayed on the OSHA 300 Log in column F
 which will provide each medical center flexibility in resolving citations
 unique to individual OSHA inspectors and regions.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW:
  
 A new 100 character free text field will be added to Signatures Tab of the 
 Complete/Validate/Sign Incident report and will be required if the Include 
 on OSHA Log (INCLUDE ON OSHA LOG (field #88) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file  
 (#2260)) is Yes prior to saving or signing the incident report.  The Safety 
 Officer, through the Safety Menu, is the only one who can complete this
 field. If the Include on OSHA Log field is changed from Yes to No, any
 data in the OSHA 300 Column F field (OSHA 300 COLUMN F (field # 384) from
 the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260)) will be removed.
  
 The data in this field will be displayed in column F on the OSHA 300 log 
 using these rules:
  
 1. If there is data in the OSHA 300 Log Column F field, then that information 
    will be displayed in Column F on the log regardless of the start and end
    date of the report.
  
 2. If there is no data in the field and the end date of the report is on or
    before 12/31/2008 the values from the Type of Incident (TYPE OF 
    INCIDENT, field #3) and Body Parts (BODY PART MOST AFFECTED, field #30) 
    from the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260), if completed, will be 
    used in Column F. 
  
 3. If the end date of the report is after 12/31/08 and there is no data in the
    field, column F will be blank as the expectation is for the safety officer
    to complete that information in calendar year 2009 and after.
