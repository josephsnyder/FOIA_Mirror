 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  
 ==============
 1)  HD0000000172308    Electronic Signature not on Printed Dual Benefits
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 After entering data, saving and entering electronic signature on the Dual
 Benefits form, when printed, is missing newly added information.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Prior to printing the form all data is collected and printed.   
  
  
 2)  HD0000000291869    Report of incident is adding a year to the age 
                        even though the DOB is correct
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 If an employee's age is 6 months and 1 day (or older) when an incident
 occurs the "Age at Time of Incident" field is rounded up.  When an
 employee is 35 and 200 days old their age is being rounded up to 36.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The "Age at Time of Incident" will no longer be rounded.
  
  
 3)  HD0000000311261    Cannot select current SECONDARY SUPERVISOR
     Duplicate:
     HD0000000331656    FUTURE TERMINATION DATE in file 200 prevents
                        SUPERVISOR from being added to case. 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Supervisors with a date in the TERMINATION DATE (#9.2) field in the NEW
 PERSON (#200) file, even when this is in the future, are not selectable in
 ASISTS.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If the date in the TERMINATION DATE (#9.2) field is in the future 
 the software will allow the supervisor's name to be displayed and
 selected.
  
  
 4)  HD0000000176044    Employee information disappears
     Duplicate:
     HD0000000201710    PROBLEM RE: ASISTS GUI
     HD0000000285902    Employee address removed
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Employee information disappears after the employee has electronically
 signed the CA1 or Notice of Occupational Disease and Claim for
 Compensation (CA2) when the supervisor tries to open the same record and
 save it.   
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If the record is currently open saving features are disabled.
  
  
 5)  HD0000000290992    Fields populated that should not be populated
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the option Complete/Validate/Sign Incident Report with a "Type
 of Incident" equal to one of the blood exposure types (Exposure to
 Body Fluids/Splash, Hollow Bore Needlestick, Sharps Exposure, Suture
 Needlestick) and subsequent incidents are accessed and saved data from the
 initial case is carried over and saved. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Data will no longer "hang" around but will be cleaned up prior to new
 claims being selected.
  
  
 6)  HD0000000178137    NOI code garbled when printing CA1
     Duplicate:
     HD0000000295358    Garbled OWCP Use NOI code
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 If the NOI code equals "TRAUMATIC INJURY - UNCLASS (EXCEPT DISEASE,
 ILLNESS) T8" the internal variable name is being printed on the CA1 form
 rather than the actual name.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the TRAUMATIC INJURY - UNCLASS. (EXCEPT DISEASE, ILLNESS) entry
 in the ASISTS DOL NATURE OF INJURY CODES (#2263.3) file to shift the 
 "-" over one position so the Delphi code does not view it as a delimiter
 and cause the display code to fail.
  
 Before:
 NAME: TRAUMATIC INJURY - UNCLASS. (EXCEPT DISEASE, ILLNESS)
  
 After:
 NAME: TRAUMATIC INJURY- UNCLASS. (EXCEPT DISEASE, ILLNESS)
  
  
 7)  HD0000000276517    Field exceeds max length error
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Department of Labor allows only 35 characters in the Physician
 Street Address field in the CA-1.  Currently ASISTS allows 80. 
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 ASISTS will be modified to allow only 35 characters for the PHYSICIAN
 ADDRESS (#157) field.
  
  
 8) HD0000000318058    Time showing incorrectly on print of CA1 form
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 If either 12:00 or 24:00 is entered in the date/time fields on the CA1
 and CA2 forms the opposite and incorrect AM/PM checkbox is marked. 
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify code so that the correct AM/PM checkbox is marked.
  
   
 9) HD0000000300258    Problem signing CA1 form for employee
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When electronically signing for an employee from the Workers Comp menu,
 if the case has data that still needs to be entered a message is 
 displayed notifying the user that data needs to be entered prior to
 signing off.  However, a bulletin is incorrectly sent to the supervisor
 telling them that an employee has signed the case when they have not.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Code has been modified to only send the bulletin when the case has
 actually been signed off on.
  
 *** Note ***
  
 The post install routine helps resolve two issues.
  
 1)  Prior to OOPS*21, several records incorrectly had the PATIENT SOURCE 
 (#34) and CONTAMINATION (#35) fields populated which should only be 
 populated when the TYPE OF INCIDENT (#3) is one that is related to blood 
 exposure.  The post install routine loops through every record and 
 removes the PATIENT SOURCE and CONTAMINATION values for every record that 
 has a TYPE OF INCIDENT that is not one of the ones below (which are blood 
 exposure types of incidents):
  
 Hollow Bore Needlestick
 Sharps Exposure
 Exposure to Body Fluids/Splash
 Suture Needlestick 
  
  
 2)  It also modifies the TRAUMATIC INJURY - UNCLASS. (EXCEPT DISEASE, 
 ILLNESS) entry in the ASISTS DOL NATURE OF INJURY CODES (#2263.3) file to 
 shift the "-" over one position to fix the issue described in ticket 
 178137.

 *** Note ***
  
 Installing the GUI portion (OOPS2_P21.exe) will not automatically remove 
 previous versions of this GUI.  This is a known issue involving Install
 Shield and will be addressed with Remedy ticket HD0000000384129.  This has
 no impact on the functionality contained in this patch.
  
   
 The KIDS build will be distributed in the normal fashion. All VA Medical
 Centers are encouraged to use the TCPIP FTP functionality to obtain the
 GUI portion of the software, along with the ASISTS GUI Installation Guide 
 (OOPS2_0IG.PDF), from one of the following OI Field Offices:

 No updated documentation is introduced by this patch.
   
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
