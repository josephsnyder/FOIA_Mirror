Description:
============

 This patch contains modifications that address privacy act concerns, 
 modifications to the CA-7 to meet Department of Labor (DOL) changes to the 
 form, minor enhancements, unreported bugs, and remedy tickets.
  
 This patch contains a new GUI.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW:
  
 1. Modifications to the menu options:
  
    a. Occupational Health menu 
         Removed the following options:
           Print CA1/CA2
           Approve Workers' Comp Signing for Employee
  
    b. Safety Menu
         Removed the following options:
           Print CA1/CA2
           Approve Workers' Comp Signing for Employee
           Complete/Validate/Sign CA1
           Complete/Validate/Sign CA2
         Renamed the following option:
           From: Manual Transmit of National Database (2162) Data
             To: Manual Transmit of National Database Data
  
    c. Workers' Compensation (WC) menu
         Removed the following options:
           Create Accident/Illness Report
           Create Amendment
           Complete/Validate/Sign Accident Report (2162)
           Classify Incident Outcome
           Display Incident Outcome Report
           Display Incidence Rates Worksheet
  
    d. Modifications to the WC menu option: Electronically Sign for Employee
       the Occupational Health and Safety Officer no longer have to
       provide their 'approval' for the WC manager signing either
       the CA-1 or CA-2 for the employee.  The WC manager can now access the 
       claim via this option and sign for the employee provide all required 
       fields have been completed.  No other functionality was changed.
  
    e. All references to the Report of Accident (2162) were changed to Report 
       of Incident.  All references to form 2162 were removed.
   
    f. Changed the name of the Incident Reports option to Summary Incident
       Reports on all menu options.
  
  
 2. Modify the Create Accident/Illness Report Option
  
    a. Change the name of the option to Create Incident Report.
   
    b. Added a new field SEVERITY OF INJURY (#360) in the ASISTS ACCIDENT 
       REPORTING file (#2260).  If the incident is an injury the user 
       is prompted to enter a response in this field and the field is 
       required. 
  
       The set of valid codes are:
           1  No Treatment Required
           2  First Aid Only
           3  Medical Treatment
           4  Disabling Injury
           5  Fatality
    
    c. The following (6) radio groups on the Quick OSHA Log Assessment panel
       have had their default values changed from 'No' to 'None Selected':
      
       Was there Loss of Consciousness 
         (LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (#349) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260))
       Hospitalized overnight as in-patient 
         (HOSPITALIZED AS INPATIENT (#339) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
                file (#2260))
       Treated in non-VA Emergency Room 
         (NON VA ER TREATMENT RCVD (#338) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
               file (#2260))
       Was prescription strength medication ordered/given 
         (PRESCRIPTION STRGTH MEDS GIVEN (#350) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
               file (#2260))
       Was non-Rx medication ordered/given at Rx strength
         (NON-SCRIPT MEDS AT SCRIPT DOSE (#315) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
               file (#2260))
       Initial return to work status 
         (INITIAL RETURN TO WORK STATUS (#352) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
               file (#2260))
  
       A new radio button: None Selected was added and is now the default when
       the user opens the form.  A value other than None Selected must be 
       checked in the fields listed above in order to create a new case.  
       The None Selected radio button was used to maintain 508 compliance.
  
   d.  Correct two unreported bugs in this option:
       - Proper data validation for time did not occur if the Incident was an
         Illness, the Date First Aware of Illness had been previously 
         entered, and the Incident was changed to an Injury. Data validation
         will now occur when the Injury/Illness field changes and there has 
         been a date entered.
       - The error message for the Quick OSHA Log Assessment (QOLA) radio
         group: Treated in non-VA Emergency Room was changed from
         'Please enter if Individual treated in the Emergency Room' to
         'Please enter if Individual treated in a non VA Emergency Room'.
  
 3. Modify the Complete/Validate/Sign Accident Report (2162) Option
  
    a. Changed the name of the option to Complete/Validate Sign Incident Report
  
    b. Added a new tab after the General Settings tab: Other Factors
       Six new fields were added:
         Weather Factor (WEATHER FACTOR (#354) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
             file (#2260))
         Source of Incident (SOURCE OF INCIDENT (#355) ASISTS ACCIDENT 
             REPORTING file (#2260))
         Cause of Incident (CAUSE OF INCIDENT (#356) ASISTS ACCIDENT 
             REPORTING file (#2260))
         Prevention Method (PREVENTIVE METHOD (#357) ASISTS ACCIDENT 
             REPORTING file (#2260))
         Additional Cause of Incident (PREVENTIVE METHOD (#358) ASISTS 
             ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260))
         Status of Corrective Action (STATUS OF CORRECTIVE ACTION (#359) 
             ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260))
       and are required prior to the Supervisor signing the Incident 
       Report.  The Description of Incident field was moved from the 
       General Settings Tab and the fields on that tab were re-organized.
   
    c.  Added "NOTE: No personal identifiers should be used!" to the Description 
        Incident prompt.
  
    d. Added "(No personal identifiers should be used)" to the Corrective 
       Action and Safety Comments prompt on the Signatures tab.
  
  
 4. Modify the Print Report of Accident (2162)
  
    a. Changed the name of the option to Print Report of Incident.
  
    b. Changed the report title to "Veterans Health Administration Incident 
       report".
   
    c. Added Report Type to the immediate right of Case number on page 1 of the 
       report.  The value of this block is derived from the database: if the 
       case has been amended Report Type = Corrected, otherwise the value is 
       Initial.
    
    d. Changed the SSN display from the actual value to xxx-xx-NNNN where only 
       the last 4 numbers of the SSN are displayed.
   
    e. Changed the Date of Birth (DOB) block to Age at Time of Incident.  The 
       age is derived from the DOB and Date/Time of Occurrence (DATE/TIME OF 
       OCCURRENCE (#4) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file #2260).
  
    f. Removed "FORM 2162" from the bottom left hand corner of page 1 of the 
       report.
  
    g. Added the report run date and time at the bottom right hand corner of 
       each page of the report.
  
    h. Modified page 3 of the report.  Inserted the following new fields at the 
       top of the page and adjusted the OSHA fields towards the bottom:
  
         Weather Factor (WEATHER FACTOR (#354) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
            file #2260)
         Source of Incident (SOURCE OF INCIDENT (#355) ASISTS ACCIDENT 
            REPORTING file #2260)
         Cause of Incident (CAUSE OF INCIDENT (#356) ASISTS ACCIDENT 
            REPORTING file #2260)
         Additional Cause of Incident (ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF INCIDENT (#357) 
            ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file #2260)
         Prevention Method (PREVENTIVE METHOD (#358) ASISTS ACCIDENT 
            REPORTING file #2260)
         Status of Corrective Action (STATUS OF CORRECTIVE ACTION (#359)
            ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file #2260)
  
  
 5. Modify Print Accident Report Status report
  
    a. Changed the name of the option to Print Incident Report Status.
  
    b. Changed the name of the report title from Accident Report to 
       Incident Report Status.
  
    c. Changed the SSN display from nnn-nn-nnnn to xxx-xx-nnnn.
  
  
 6. Modify ASISTS to not automatically pull the employee address and home 
    phone number fields from the PAID Employee file (#450).  The creator 
    of the Incident Report must now enter those required fields.
  
  
 7. A new bulletin: OOPS INCIDENT OUTCOME REQUIRED has been added.
  
    a. The newly added bulletin will be sent to the OOPS Safety Mail groups 
       when INITITAL RETURN TO WORK STATUS (#352) in the ASISTS ACCIDENT 
       REPORTING file (#2260), is "DAYS AWAY WORK" or 
       "Job Transfer/Restriction". This bulletin can be sent when creating 
       an incident report or completing/validating/signing an Incident Report.
       It will be sent anytime the value is changed to either of the values 
       above.
   
    b. The text of the bulletin is:
  
       Subj: ASISTS - Incident Outcome Required  [#214] 05/06/08@13:53  8 lines
       From: ASISTS, USER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
       A new incident has been entered or an existing incident has been
       modified where the Initial Return to Work Status for the incident  
       is "Days Away Work" or "Job Transfer/Restriction".
  
       The Case Number is: 2008-000XX
  
       An entry in the Classify Incident Outcome option is required to  
       record the dates and the incident outcome for this case. 
  
  
 8. Modifications to the Log of Needlestick report
    
    a. The Include Names of Persons Involved prompt has been removed from the 
       Enter/edit screen.  For this report this prompt did not result in the 
       outcome suggested and was therefore removed.  Prior to this change the 
       name field would either be Blank or contain the words "Privacy Case".
       The report has been modified to always contain the words "Privacy Case" 
       in the name field for privacy concerns.
  
    b. A lost time indicator has also been added back into the report (it was 
       removed in OOPS*2.0*7).  The column name is "Lost Time" has been added 
       on the top line of the report, after C Ctr (Cost Center).  The Lost 
       Time column will contain either Yes or No.  If the response for field: 
       INITIAL RETURN TO WORK STATUS (#352) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file 
       (#2260) = "DAYS AWAY WORK" then Lost Time = 'Yes', otherwise 
       Lost Time = 'No'.
  
  
 9. Modification to the CA-7 (Request for Compensation) (Enter/Edit form)
  
    a. A new field was added in the CA7 - Request for Compensation enter/edit 
       form:  DATE CA7 RCVD FROM EMP (#98) in the ASISTS COMPENSATION CLAIM 
       (CA7) file (#2264).  The prompt is added in Section 15 and must be 
       completed before the WC specialist can electronically sign the form. 
       The only data validation completed is that it must be a valid date and 
       cannot precede the date the form was created.
  
    b. Correction of an unreported bug fix is included involving Section 6:  the 
       radio buttons were getting reset to unchecked after data from the claim  
       had been loaded.  This resulted in logic getting executed that "erased"
       data potentially without the user being aware.
  
    c. Correction of an unreported bug fix where the signature was not displayed 
       if the user or WC specialist had signed the form - the appearance was  
       that the form had not been signed when it had.  Additionally, the 
       sign/validate button was not properly enabled when a user entered the 
       form.  Corrected the problem so the user could click the sign/validate 
       button and be prompted to sign the form.
  
  
 10. Modifications to the Print CA-7 Report Option
  
     a. Section 1: changed the expires date from 08/31/2005 to 10/31/2008
  
     b. Section 3: text in this section has been changed
        From:  Have you worked outside your federal job during the period(s) 
               claimed in Section 2?
               (Include salaried, self-employed, commission, volunteer, etc.)
  
        To: You must report all earnings from employment (outside your federal 
            job); include any employment for which you received a salary, wage 
            income, sales commissions, piecework, or payment of any kind during 
            the period(s) claimed in Section 2. Include self-employment, 
            involvement in business enterprises, as well as service with the 
            military forces. Fraudulent concealment of employment or failure to 
            report income may result in forfeiture of compensation benefits 
            and/or criminal prosecution. Have you worked outside your federal 
            job for the period(s) claimed in Section 2?
  
     c. Section 6c: added check boxes for the retirement field - if the data 
        value = CSRS then the  CSRS box is checked, if FERS then the FERS  
        checkbox should be checked, if SSA then the SSA checkbox should be 
        checked and if not one of those 3 then the Other check box should 
        be checked. 
  
     d. Changed form reference at bottom right corner of page 1 to:
        Form CA-7 Rev. June 2005.
  
     e. Section 10c: added "D-Z only" underneath the line next to the Class 
        field.
  
     f. Section 13 - removed the lines in the Explanation text area but still
        print all 240 characters of text.
  
     g. Section 15: added the new field: Date Claim Form Received from Employee 
        below the Name of Agency field.  Increased the size of the area 
        slightly.
  
     h. Added new Privacy Act paragraph (completely new page 4).
  
        Note:  the current hardcopy form can be downloaded from:  
        http://www.dol.gov/libraryforms/go-us-dol-form.asp?FormNumber=362
  
  
 11. Modification to keep M and Delphi side in synch - modified M and Delphi
     code to reflect version 2.15.1.0.
  
 12. Modifications to deficiencies without Remedy Tickets:
  
     a. Modified the M routine to only pull 30 characters of description from 
        the OCCUPATIONAL SERIES AND TITLE field (#1) from the PAID CODE FILES  
        (#454) description to populate the ASISTS field: OCCUPATION (#111) 
        ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260), due to the size constraints 
        for sending this data to DOL.  This modification will only be apparent
        to the user if the Occupation for the employee is truncated in the 
        CA-1 or CA-2.
  
     b. Moved the date in block 22 (Date of Injury) slightly to the left on 
        the hardcopy CA-1 so that it did not overlap into block 23 (Date Notice
        Received).
   
     c. Corrected an issue on the Physician tab of the CA-1 where the prompts
        for the Physician fields: Title, Street, City, State, and Zip were 
        partially hidden when the fields were required.  When the fields were
        not required they displayed properly.
  
     d. Several date fields in ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260) were 
        modified to K %DT in the input transform.  The failure to kill this 
        variable resulted in a bug where the Print Accident Report Status 
        (now Print Incident Report Status) incorrectly reported that no data 
        was found if it was run immediately after creating a new record 
        (Create Incident Report) for a personnel status of anything other 
        than an employee.  The following fields were modified:
  
        DATE/TIME STUB CREATED (#90) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260)
        DATE OUTCOME CREATED (#6) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260), 
                 INCIDENT OUTCOME SUB-FIELD (#2260.095)
        LAST EDIT DATE (#8) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260), 
                 INCIDENT OUTCOME SUB-FIELD (#2260.095)
        DATE/TIME WORK STOPPED (#142) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260)
        DATE PAY STOPPED (#143) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260)
        DATE 45 DAY PERIOD BEGAN (#144) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING
                 File (#2260)
        DATE/TIME RETURNED TO WORK (#145) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
                 File (#2260)
        DATE/TIME WORK STOPPED (#253) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260)
        DATE/TIME PAY STOPPED (#254) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260)
        DATE/TIME RETURNED TO WORK (#256) ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
                 File (#2260)
        OSHA MONTH/YEAR (#.01) ASISTS SITE PARAMETER File (#2262), 
                 OSHA MONTH/YEAR SUB-FIELD (#2262.315)
   
     e. Log of Needlestick Report
        The deficiency that has been corrected is if the report criteria 
        resulted in no data being found the printed message on the report 
        was:  THERE IS NO DATA TO REPORT FOR.  The message has been changed 
        to print:  THERE IS NO DATA TO REPORT FOR THIS TIME FRAME when no 
        data is returned. 
  
  
    ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS:
  
     The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service Requests 
     associated with this patch
  
    1. Associated Remedy Ticket(s):
       -----------------------------
       HD0000000130515
       Problem:
         If the OSHA 300 log has more than 9 pages the page numbers do not print 
         on the report.
       Resolution:
         Modify the Delphi code to allow for any number of pages printing on the 
         report.
  
       HD0000000152026
       Problem: 
         In the Create Incident Report Option, when creating a case for an 
         employee employees who were separated from the PAID EMPLOYEE File 
         (#450) were eligible to be selected.  Additionally, when creating 
         a case for a non-paid employee a person who was terminated from 
         the NEW PERSON file (#200) could be selected.
       Resolution:
         Modify the M code to exclude any employees that are separated (an entry 
         of 'Yes' in the SEPARATION IND field (#80) in the PAID EMPLOYEE File 
         (#450).  Additionally, exclude individuals in the NEW PERSON File 
         (#200) if there is a date in the TERMINATION DATE field (#9.2).
  
       HD0000000183787
       Problem:
         If the time for REGULAR HRS FROM TIME (#138) ASISTS ACCIDENT 
         REPORTING file (#2260) or REGULAR HRS TO TIME (#139) ASISTS 
         ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260) is 'Midnight' the AM Box is not 
         correctly checked when printing the CA-1.
       Resolution:
         Modified the Delphi code to recognize Midnight and appropriately 
         check the AM box.
  
       HD0000000206374
       Problem:
         In the Create Incident Report or the Complete/Validate/Sign Incident 
         Report a user is able to select a terminated Supervisor or Secondary 
         Supervisor.
       Resolution:
         Modify the M code to exclude any person in the NEW PERSON File (#200) 
         who had a date in the TERMINATION DATE field (#9.2).
