Subject: Release of Pharmacy Reengineering (PRE) Medication Order 
Checks for Healthcare Application (MOCHA) v2.0
 
RELEASE INFORMATION:
We are pleased to announce that the phased deployment of the MOCHA v2.0 
Dosing Check software will officially begin on March 24, 2014. MOCHA v2.0 
will introduce a Maximum Single Dose order check to Outpatient Pharmacy, 
Inpatient Medications, and Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and 
will be released in five phases called "waves".
 
Instructions for installation are included in the VistA to MOCHA 
Interface Document and the MOCHA v2.0 Combined Build Installation Guide. 
 
MOCHA v2.0 major features include:
        Implements Maximum Single Dose Order Check for simple and complex 
orders in Outpatient Pharmacy and Inpatient Medications applications and 
CPRS.
        Provides error messages with reasons at the order level when a 
Maximum Single Dose Order Check cannot be performed for Pharmacy users.
        Provides a generic error message at the order level when a 
Maximum Single Dose Order Check cannot be performed for CPRS users.
        Supports the ability to exclude a schedule from all Dosing Order 
Checks.
        Creates a new PDM option called Lookup Dosing Check Info for Drug 
[PSS DRUG DOSING LOOKUP] so that a user can view all data that can affect 
Dosing Order Checks for a drug.
        Creates and auto enables a new DOSING_INFO web service.
        Provides an option to enable/disable Dosing Order Checks called 
Enable/Disable Dosing Order Checks [PSS DOSING ORDER CHECKS], which also 
includes generation of a notification and an audit trail.
