Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*290
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*411
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*8
   
 The three patches (PSO*7*290, IB*2*411 and BPS*1*8) are being released in 
 the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 4.0.  For more specific instructions please
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
   
 This patch modifies the Integrated Billing v2.0 application as described 
 below:
   
 1.  Third Party Joint Inquiry (TPJI),
     Receipt Processing and Decrease Adjustment
 -------------------------------------------------
 This patch modifies the lookup of ePharmacy transactions to display 
 additional information to assist in the bill selection.  When a lookup for
 a bill is done and multiple matches are found the insurance company name
 and a Coordination of Benefits (COB) indicator will now be displayed.
  
     Select one of the following:
  
           BILL        RX        DATE      INSURANCE        COB   PATIENT
       
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      3   K60008Re   100714      07/16/07  NEW YORK LIFE IN       IBPATIENT,ONE
  
     Select one of the bills by number:
  
  
 2. Changes to support ePharmacy secondary billing
 -------------------------------------------------
 Electronic Claims Management Engine package was modified to allow the user
 to submit an e-claim to secondary payers. IB software was modified to
 support secondary billing for e-Pharmacy claims, to create secondary bills
 for specific insurance plans and rate types. Note: the Claims Tracking
 system is not updated with the results of secondary billing except in 
 cases where the primary payer rejects the claim, but the secondary payer 
 pays.
  
 3. Changes to IB ECME EVENTS report
 -----------------------------------
 IB ECME EVENTS report was modified to capture, store and display RX COB 
 (payer sequence) indicators.
  
 4. BILLINFO^IBNCPDPI API modification
 -------------------------------------
 In order to support a new secondary billing functionality for e-Pharmacy 
 the IB Application Programmer Interface (API) BILLINFO^IBNCPDPI (ICR
 #4729) was modified to accept a new parameter to pass in the payer
 sequence to return information for a specific bill - primary or secondary.
  
 5. RNB^IBNCPDPI API addition
 ----------------------------
 In order to provide additional billing functionality for e-Pharmacy, the
 IB API RNB^IBNCPDPI (ICR# 4729) was created to provide information
 about whether or not the Claims Tracking episode for a specific 
 Prescription and Fill is billable.
  
 6. New APIs for e-Pharmacy
 --------------------------
 In order to support a new secondary billing functionality for e-Pharmacy 
 three new APIs were introduced (ICR # 5355) in this patch: ISBILL^IBNCPUT3
 - to determine if there is a bill with a given bill #, BILINF^IBNCPUT3 -
 to get bill details from file #399, RXBILL^IBNCPUT3 - to find bill(s) for
 the specific RX/refill.
  
 7. A new IB API to support ECME Potential Secondary Rx Claims Report
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 The COLLECT^IBOSRX API (ICR # 5361) was designed to collect IB data for
 ECME Potential Secondary Rx Claims Report.
  
 8. The bill matching functionality
 ----------------------------------
 The code responsible for bill matching was adjusted to correctly process 
 bills with different payer sequence (primary and secondary bills). Also 
 modifications have been made to unify the matching process and use 7 
 digit format with leading zeros for ECME number identifiers (BCID).
  
 The post-install routine will loop through all ECME number identifiers and
 make sure they are 7 characters long. 
  
 9. Removing non-standard cross-references
 -----------------------------------------
 The software was modified so that the non-standard "AG" cross-references
 of the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) are no longer used.  The post-install
 routine will clean up the "AG" node of the file, removing part of the
 non-FileMan standard cross-references.
  
 10. New Action in Patient Insurance Management
 ----------------------------------------------
 A new ListManager action has been added to the Patient Insurance 
 Management screen to allow the user to quickly identify which of the 
 patient's insurance policies provide for pharmacy coverage as of a user 
 specified prescription fill date. The name of the new action is "RX COB
 Determination".

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
   
  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
   
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
      specific server as follows:
   
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation 
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.
   
 The documentation distribution includes:
   
     FILE NAME                             DESCRIPTION

     ib_2_p411_rn.pdf                      IB Release Notes
   
   
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 Phoenix
 Loma Linda
 Tennessee Valley
 Kansas City
   
  
  
 Post Installation Overview
 --------------------------
 The IB post-install routine delivered with IB*2*411 will schedule a job to
 run in 3 days which removes invalid cross references.  The three days
 allows additional processing time to eliminate any remaining dependencies
 on the old cross references.
  
 It is important that the post install routine IB20P411 NOT be deleted
 prior to the running of the background tasked job.  At the completion of
 the background tasked job, the installer will receive a MailMan message
 indicating the post install routine may be removed from the site's system.
  
   
   
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
   
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed when users are 
 not on the system and during non-peak hours.  Of particular concern would
 be the items below.
   
     1.  Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
         by the BPS Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY
         BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job to finish or complete the
         installation before this job starts.
     2.  Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being 
         transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish 
         or complete the installation before the transmission starts.  
         Check with Pharmacy Service or your pharmacy Automated Data
         Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to find out when
         CMOP transmissions occur.
     3.  In addition, note that you will be prompted to disable the
         following options during the installation:
  
           Patient Insurance Info View/Edit [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
           ECME [BPSMENU]
           Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]
           ECME Billing Events Report [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]
   
   
 Install Time - Approximately 10 minutes

      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
   
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
   
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
