Description:
============

 This patch is one of four patches to enhance the ePharmacy software, to 
 provide the framework to support Tricare and Active Duty outpatient 
 pharmacy billing.  The Tricare/Active Duty portions of this software 
 enhancement will not be active until a future patch is released.  The 
 release of the additional patch is pending the CBO and contracting with 
 the Tricare Fiscal Intermediary.
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along 
 with their associated patch number:
  
        APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
      --------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*66
  2.  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*287
  3.  ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*6
  4.  INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*383
  
 All four patches are being released separately with a requirement that 
 they be installed in the order outlined above.
  
 It is important that all four patches be installed completely one right 
 after the other. If they are not, you may see errors occur during the
 Outpatient prescription entry process.
  
 There are no other dependencies between these patches, except that
 Tricare/Active Duty billing will not be supported by ePharmacy until all 4
 patches are installed.
  
  
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not their
 site has been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO)
 or are providing outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare or Active Duty
 patients.  After the installation of these patches, the activation status 
 of the site will not be impacted.  Activation of the ePharmacy product
 will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not to activate
 ePharmacy unless instructed specifically by the CBO.  Also, sites should
 not start to provide outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare without
 discussions with the CBO.
  
  
 This patch modifies the IB v2.0 application as described below.  The 
 modifications are labeled dormant in the software will remain inactive 
 until the future Tricare patch is released.
  
  
 1.  Billing Determination (dormant)
 -------------------------
 Prior to this patch only patients with a primary eligibility type of
 Veteran were considered eligible for ePharmacy billing.  This patch adds
 functionally to consider both Tricare and Sharing Agreement (Active Duty)
 patients eligible for ePharmacy billing.  The patient must have ONLY
 Tricare or Sharing Agreement eligibility and have a Group Insurance Plan
 type of Tricare ONLY.  The ePharmacy payer sheet must be linked to the
 group insurance plan and the payer sheet must be active at the local site,
 Integrated Billing will now consider these patients ePharmacy billable.  
 This will encompass the sites that are approved for Tricare pharmacy
 billing and all sites if set up for Active Duty pharmacy billing.  There
 will be an additional check to prevent ECME back billing of claims that
 have previously been billed through the legacy RNA or Class III systems.
  
  
 2.  Billing Rates (dormant)
 -----------------
 For billable claims, when ECME calls Integrated Billing, IB will return
 the appropriate billing rates to ECME.  The billing unit cost will be
 based on the current drug cost based upon the NDC plus a dispensing fee
 that is currently eight dollars.  The computed gross amount is passed back
 to ECME as part of the TRICARE Pharmacy Billing Message (PBM) insurance
 data.
  
  
 3.  3rd and 1st Party Bills (dormant)
 ---------------------------
 Upon receipt of PAID claim information, IB will create the appropriate 3rd
 and 1st party bills.  Appropriate Billing Rates are pre-determined during
 the billable status check (ie Reimbursable or Tricare).  3rd and 1st party
 bills will only be established if there is an amount due for each of them.
 Example:  Active Duty patients currently have a $0.00 copayment, therefore
 no 1st party bill would be established.
  
  
 4.  Charge Master Update
 ------------------------
 Installation of this patch, will update the Charge Master with nationally
 standard VA Cost Charge Sets and Rate Schedules, inactivating locally
 created ones, for both Prescription and Prosthetic cost.  The new
 nationally standard VA Cost Charge Sets are:
  
      RX COST
      PI COST
  
 The new nationally standard Rate Schedules for Tricare Pharmacy are:
  
      TR-RX (Tricare)
      TRRI-RX (Tricare Reimbursable Insurance)
  
 After install is completed you should review any locally created or
 modified Charge Sets and Rate Schedules.
