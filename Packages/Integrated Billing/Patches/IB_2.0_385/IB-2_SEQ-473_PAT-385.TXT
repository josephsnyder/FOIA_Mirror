 *****************************************************************************
 Note:  This patch is an emergency release with a 72-hour compliance.
  
        This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment System
        (ES) Discontinue Annual Means Test Renewal project.  Patch IB*2*385
        (Integrated Billing) is being released along with DG*5.3*858
        (Registration), IVM*2*154 (Income Verification Match), EAS*1*106
        (Enrollment Application System) and DGBT*1*24 (Beneficiary Travel)
        in host file: DG_53_P858.KID.
   
        It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
        compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
 *****************************************************************************
  
  
 This patch provides the functional changes for the Integrated Billing 
 package to properly create Veteran medication copayment exemption records
 as a result of the discontinuance of the annual Means Test renewal 
 process.  Any Means Tests with a Date of Test no earlier than one year 
 before the VFA start date (1/1/13) do not require subsequent tests; the
 income reported shall stay in effect indefinitely as it relates to the
 Veteran's responsibility eligibility for medication and medical care
 copayments.  No changes are required for the administration of medical
 care copayments.  However, changes are required in the determination of
 the medication copayment exemption.  An income-based exemption from the
 medical copayment expires after 365 days, and the Veteran returns to a
 non-exempt status until a subsequent income statement is submitted to VA
 that places the Veteran in an exempt status.  This functionality is being
 provided so that medication copayment exemptions dated within one year of
 the VFA start date, and are based on income reported through a Means Test,
 stay in effect indefinitely.
  
  
 OPTIONS
 ------- 
 The following Integrated Billing options are being modified:
  
    Reprint Single Income Test Reminder Letter [IB RX REPRINT REMINDER]
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    This option allows the user to select a patient and regenerate an
    income test reminder letter.  The option only allows the user to
    generate letters for Veterans whose current medication copayment
    exemption record is based on income (exemption reason is either
    INCOME<PENSION or INCOME>PENSION).  The system provides a note to the
    user to warn that the Veteran is not required to take the Means Test if
    the Veteran has a current Means Test status of MT COPAY REQUIRED or
    PENDING ADJUDICATION.
  
    This option is being modified to incorporate an additional warning 
    message to the user, if the Veteran's current medication copayment 
    exemption record is based on a Means Test, and if the exemption date
    (and thus Means Test effective date) is within one year of the VFA
    start date. The warning will state that the Veteran's exemption record
    is based on a Means Test and that the Veteran is not required to take
    another Means Test.  The system will both issue this warning and not
    allow the user to re-print the letter.
  
    Letters to Exempt Patients [IB RX PRINT EX LETERS]
    --------------------------------------------------
    This option generates the letter IB NOW EXEMPT that is stored in the IB
    FORM LETTER (#354.6) file and sends it to all Veterans stored in the 
    BILLING PATIENT (#354) who are exempt from the medication copayment but
    are not SC>50%.
  
    The exemption letter prints "Renewal Date: MON, DD YYYY" under the 
    Veteran's name if the Veteran's exemption record is based on income (a 
    Means Test or a Copayment Test).  This functionality is being modified
    to print "Renewal Date: MON, DD YYYY" under the Veteran's name if the
    Veteran's exemption record is based on a Copayment Test only.
  
  
  
 BACKGROUND PROCESSES
 -------------------- 
 The following Integrated Billing background processes are being modified:
  
    Generation of Income Test Reminder Letters
    ------------------------------------------
    Income test reminder letters are generated each evening as part of 
    Integrated Billing's nightly background job.  This process only
    generates reminder letters for Veterans whose exemption reason is
    either INCOME<PENSION or INCOME>PENSION.
  
    This process is being modified to incorporate an additional edit to 
    assure that a letter is not printed for a Veteran whose medication 
    copayment exemption record is based on a Means Test, if the exemption 
    date (and thus Means Test effective date) is within one year of the VFA
    start date.
  
    Means Test Event Driver Interface
    ---------------------------------
    The Integrated Billing application is a subscriber of the Means Test 
    Event Driver, allowing it to perform any necessary data processing, in 
    real time, when Means Tests or Copayment Tests are added, edited, or 
    deleted.  The Integrated Billing Means Test Event Driver interface 
    software generates medication copayment exemption records when Means 
    Tests and Copayment Tests are added to the system.
  
    When a Means Test or Copayment Test, which has an effective date that
    is more than a year in the past, is deleted, the system creates a
    "non-exempt" medication copayment exemption record with the exemption 
    reason of NO INCOME DATA.  This process is being modified to not create
    a "non-exempt" exemption record if the exemption in effect before the
    effective date of the deleted test was based on a Means Test that has
    an effective date within one year of the VFA start date.
  
  
 APPLICATION PROGRAMMER INTERFACES
 --------------------------------- 
 The following Integrated Billing application programmer interfaces (APIs) 
 are being modified:
  
    Veteran Medication Copayment Exemption Status Determination
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Integrated Billing provides an API that allows Vista applications to 
    retrieve, and alternately display to the screen, a Veteran's medication
    copayment exemption status (that has been filed within Integrated 
    Billing) that is effective on a specified date.
  
    When the Veteran's exemption status is requested for a date that is 365
    days after the date of the Veteran's last determined exemption status, 
    the system generates statements indicating that the status on file is
    no longer effective, and that a new exemption is required, unless the
    Veteran is automatically exempted from the copayment.  This rule is
    being modified to indicate that the status on file is no longer
    effective unless the Veteran is automatically exempted from the
    copayment or if the exemption on file is based on a Means Test that has
    an effective date within one year of the VFA start date.
  
    When the Veteran's exemption status is requested for a date that is
    less recent than the date of the Veteran's current exemption status,
    the status that is calculated is based on the historical exemption
    record with an exemption date that was "most recent" to the request
    date.  If that exemption date is more than 365 days earlier than the
    request date, the system generates statements indicating that the
    status on file (for the request date) is no longer effective, and that
    a new exemption is required, unless the Veteran is automatically
    exempted from the copayment on the request date.  This rule is being
    modified to indicate that the status on file is no longer effective
    unless the Veteran is automatically exempted from the copayment on the
    request date, or if the historical exemption record is based on a Means
    Test that has an effective date within one year of the VFA start date.
  
    Veteran Medication Copayment Exemption Status Calculation
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Integrated Billing has an API that it uses, when making a medication 
    copayment billing decision, to retrieve a Veteran's current medication 
    copayment exemption status (that has been filed within Integrated 
    Billing) or, if the current status is no longer in effect, to
    calculate, file, and retrieve the current status.
  
    When the Veteran's exemption status is required for a date that is 365 
    days after the date of the Veteran's current (active) exemption status,
    the system will calculate and file a new medication copayment exemption
    record and return that exemption's status.  This rule is being be 
    modified to only calculate and file a new exemption record if the
    active exemption on file is not based on a Means Test that has an
    effective date within one year of the VFA start date.
  
    When the Veteran's exemption status is required for a date that is less
    recent than the date of the Veteran's current exemption status, the 
    status that is retrieved is based on the historical exemption record
    with an exemption date that was "most recent" to the request date.  If
    that exemption date is more than 365 days earlier than the required
    date, the system will calculate and file a new exemption record that is
    effective on the required date.  This rule is being modified to only
    calculate and file a new exemption record if the historical exemption
    record is not based on a Means Test that has an effective date within 
    one year of the VFA start date.
  
    Medication Copayment Exemption Status Calculation Based on Income
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    Integrated Billing has an API that it uses internally to determine a 
    Veteran's medication copayment exemption status based on an income test
    that is in effect on the date that the exemption status is required.
  
    If the API retrieves a test with an effective date of more than 365
    days prior to the date that the exemption status is required, the API
    will compute the Veteran's exemption status to be non-exempt, with the
    exemption reason of NO INCOME DATA.  This rule is being modified to 
    utilize , for the purpose of computing the Veteran's exemption status, 
    the income from such a test, if that test is a Means Test that has an 
    effective date within one year of the VFA start date.
  
  
 POST-INSTALL PROCESS
 -------------------- 
 It was discovered the code for CATASTROPHICALLY DISABLED in the EXEMPTION
 REASON (#354.2) file was set to a value with 3 digits.  Auto-exemption
 reasons should contain a code of 2 digits.  The post-install will update
 that code to 70, one that isn't being used by the Integrated Billing
 package.
