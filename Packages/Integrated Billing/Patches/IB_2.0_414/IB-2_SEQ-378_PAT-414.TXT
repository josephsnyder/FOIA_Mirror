Subject: ALLOW 9 DIGIT ZIP CODES ON 837's

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch allows 9 digit zip codes to be transmitted on Bills sent
 electronically to Trailblazers.  Trailblazers is a fiscal
 intermediary that acts on behalf of Medicare.  Prior to this patch, 9
 digit zip codes were being shortened to 5 which led to claims being
 rejected.

 Problem: 
 ========
 Currently the LENGTH (#.09) field in the IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION
 (#364.6) file for the "Billing Provider ZIP Code" and the "Lab/Facility
 ZIP Code" entries only allow 5 digits.  This leads to claim rejections 
 when the bills reach Trailblazers.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modified the LENGTH (#.09) field in the IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION
 (#364.6) file for the two entries in question to except up to 9 digits.
  
 Also, since the Lab/Facility may contain a "-" as a separator, the field
 is stripped of this character before being transmitted to conform to
 the 9 digit max length.
