Description:
============

 This patch contains several updates to Integrated Billing for billable 
 event processing and reports related to billing Reasonable Charges.  No 
 charges are updated or exported with this patch.
                                       
 New Reasons Not Billable and updates to Insurance Timely Filing Timeframe 
 with supporting Claims Tracking functionality are the primary updates.
                                       
                                       
 UPDATE REASON NOT BILLABLE LIST
 ===============================
 The Reasons Not Billable (RNB) list is a standard set of reasons that may 
 be assigned to an event in Claims Tracking to specify why the event is not 
 billable.  This list, exported by Integrated Billing, should not be 
 locally modified.   CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8)
                                       
 There are significant changes to the list of Reasons Not Billable, both 
 Reasons added and functionality changes.
                                       
 Note that this patch will modify the definition of Reasons Not Billable.  
 Currently these are either reasons the event should not be billed (SC 
 TREATMENT) or indicators that the event is not currently billable but may 
 be if further work is done on the event (NEEDS SC DETERMINATION).  This 
 patch will add reasons indicating that although the event is only partially 
 charged it has been billed in full (BILLED INSTITUTIONAL ONLY).
                                       
 STANDARD REASONS NOT BILLABLE
 -----------------------------
 The list of Reasons Not Billable is standard and should not be locally 
 modified.  This patch will check each site to ensure that the standard list 
 of Reasons are defined.  Any missing RNBs will be identified during the 
 patch installation.  See the updated RNB list below for the 39 valid 
 pre-patch standard Reasons Not Billable.
                                       
 INACTIVATE NON-STANDARD REASONS NOT BILLABLE
 --------------------------------------------
 The list of Reasons Not Billable is standard and should not be locally 
 modified.  In addition, since many new RNBs will be added it is possible 
 that locally added RNBs may duplicate new standard RNBs. Therefore this 
 patch will check each sites system to ensure that only the standard list of 
 Reasons exist.  
                                       
 Any non-standard or locally modified RNBs found will be Inactivated and 
 their ECME usage flags cleared so those RNBs will no longer be usable.  Any 
 RNBs inactivated will be identified during the patch installation.
                                       
 INACTIVATE STANDARD REASONS NOT BILLABLE
 ----------------------------------------
 The ability to Inactivate a Reason Not Billable has been added.  To 
 accommodate inactivating RNBs a new field, INACTIVE (.05), was added to the 
 CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8).  
                                       
 When a Reason Not Billable is entered for a Claims Tracking event an RNB 
 with the Inactive flag set will not be selectable.
                                       
 Several existing RNBs will be inactivated and no longer available for use.  
 Generally, these reasons are no longer applicable or were replaced by more 
 specific reasons:
                                       
         SERVICE NOT COVERED
         BILL PURGED
         INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION
         NON-BILLABLE PROVIDER (RESID.)
         NON-BILLABLE PROVIDER (OTHER)
                                       
 During the patch installation these 5 RNBs have their Inactive flag set and 
 their ECME flags cleared.
                                       
 REASONS NOT BILLABLE FOR ECME PAPER PROCESSING
 ----------------------------------------------
 At the request of the ePharmacy group two Reasons Not Billable have been 
 changed for ECME.  Two RNBs that currently identify Non-Billable 
 prescriptions that may be billed on paper have been modified to remove the 
 paper billing option:
                                       
         90 DAY RX FILL NOT COVERED
         NOT A CONTRACTED PROVIDER
                                       
 These 2 Reasons Not Billable will no longer result in the Prescription 
 being prompted to be billed on paper.  The ECME PAPER FLAG (.03) in the 
 CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8) for the 2 RNBs is set 
 to No during the post installation.
                                       
 ADD REASONS NOT BILLABLE CODE
 -----------------------------
 A Code has been added to Reasons Not Billable to group and uniquely 
 identify each RNB.  The code will allow consistent identification and 
 grouping of RNBs for display. To accommodate this a new CODE (.04) field 
 was added to the CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8).  
                                       
 A Code for all RNBs, new and existing, will be added during the post 
 installation of this patch. Code = Group_# where groups are the following:
                                       
         BL - Reasons related to Billing
         CV - Reasons related to Coverage or Insurance
         DC - Reasons related to Documentation
         MC - Miscellaneous
         MN - Reasons related to Medical Necessity
         RX - Reasons specific to Pharmacy
         VA - Reasons specific to the VA
                                       
 See the list below for the Code added for each Reasons Not Billable.
 Note that the RNB of OTHER will still be available and active but since 
 its use should be minimized it will have no Code assigned.  OTHER should 
 only be used when there is no other more accurate RNB.
                                       
 ADD NEW REASONS NOT BILLABLE
 ----------------------------
 Many new Reasons Not Billable will be added with this patch.  The purpose 
 is to provide RNBs for many of the circumstance found in billing and in 
 some cases to be more specific than existing RNBs.  See below for 
 the list of all 58 new Reasons Not Billable.
                                       
                                       
 CLAIMS TRACKING - Map Reasons Not Billable to Care Provided
 ===========================================================
 When events are added to Claims Tracking a Reason Not Billable may 
 automatically be added.  This has been updated to assign more specific 
 Reasons if available.
                                       
 Outpatient and Prescription Coverage
 ------------------------------------
 For patients that have insurance but not insurance that covers a specific 
 type of care the Reason Not Billable of SERVICE NOT COVERED has been used.  
 This generic RNB is being replaced by the new RNBs corresponding to the 
 type of care:
 -  The new RNB of NO OUTPATIENT COVERAGE will be used for outpatient care.
 -  The new RNB of NO PHARMACY COVERAGE will be used for Prescriptions - 
    note that this option will become active with the installation 
    of IB*2*384 - ePHARMACY ENHANCEMENTS.
                                       
 Dental Coverage
 ---------------
 Although it has been possible to set Dental Coverage for insurance this has 
 been informational only.  Dental care has been identified and processed as 
 Outpatient care even though it was possible to set Dental Coverage.  This 
 has been updated to identify Dental care with Stop Code 180.  So Dental has 
 been separated from the general Outpatient care and the Dental Coverage 
 assigned to an insurance will now be applied.
 -  The new RNB of NO DENTAL COVERAGE will be used for Outpatient events 
    associated with Stop Code 180.
                                       
 Research Appointments
 ---------------------
 Several Appointment Types are not billable, including Research, and are 
 assigned the Reason Not Billable of NON-BILLABLE APPOINTMENT TYPE.  However 
 there is a more specific RNB for Research that will now be used.
 -  The RNB of RESEARCH VISIT will be used for Research appointments.
                                       
                                       
 CLAIMS TRACKING - Reason Not Billable and Additional Comments
 =============================================================
 There are two cases where requirements for Additional Comments have been 
 added based on the Reason Not Billable assigned to an event.  Both of the 
 following requirements have been added:
 -  when an RNB is added to an event in Claims Tracking
 -  when a bill is cancelled and RNBs are added to the associated events 
                                       
 Reason Not Billable of OTHER
 ----------------------------
 When the Reason Not Billable of OTHER is assigned to a Claims Tracking 
 event it will now require a Comment added of at least 15 characters.
                                       
 Reason Not Billable of GLOBAL SURGERY
 -------------------------------------
 When the new Reason Not Billable of Global Surgery is assigned to an event 
 the related surgery date will be asked and appended to the Additional 
 Comment as:  'Global Surgery: xx/xx/xx'.
                                       
                                       
 INSURANCE - Long Term Care Coverage
 ===================================
 Coverage limitations (CV) and Riders have been updated to include Long Term 
 Care.  This is informational only.
                                       
 New PLAN LIMITATION CATEGORY (#355.31):  LONG TERM CARE
 New INSURANCE RIDERS (#355.6): LONG TERM CARE COVERAGE
        
 Note that the Long Term Care Plan Limitation will default to Yes - Covered 
 for all existing Insurance Plans.
                                       
                                       
 INSURANCE - Standard Filing Time Frame
 ======================================
 The insurance filing time frame is the amount of time from the date of 
 service an insurance company or plan allows before submission of a claim.  
 It is currently possible to identify a filing time frame for both Insurance 
 Companies and Group Plans however these are free text fields that are 
 informational only, they do not affect the processing of events.
                                       
 A Standard Filing Time Frame has been added to both Companies and Plans to 
 automatically identify events past their filing time frame.
                                       
 The existing free text Filing Time Frame will continue to be available for 
 additional related information or those cases where no Standard Filing Time 
 Frame applies.
                                       
 A new INSURANCE FILING TIME FRAME (#355.13) file of Standard Filing Time 
 Frames is created, all are relative to the Date of Service: 
                                       
        DAYS                            Value - YES
        MONTH(S)                        Value - YES
        YEAR(S)                         Value - YES
        DAYS PLUS ONE YEAR              Value - YES
        DAYS OF FOLLOWING YEAR          Value - YES
        MONTHS OF FOLLOWING YEAR        Value - YES
        END OF FOLLOWING YEAR           Value - NO
        NO FILING TIME FRAME LIMIT      Value - NO
                                       
 Where VALUE indicates a numeric value is required to fully identify the 
 time frame.  For example, DAYS the value required is the number of days. 
                                       
 A Standard Filing Time Frame of 45 DAYS indicates the insurer will accept 
 claims submitted within 45 days of the Date of Service and therefore events 
 beyond that date should be considered as non-billable.
                                       
 Two new fields are added to both the Insurance Company and the Group Plan:
                                       
        INSURANCE COMPANY,     STANDARD FTF            (#36, .18)
        INSURANCE COMPANY,     STANDARD FTF VALUE      (#36, .19)
                                       
        GROUP INSURANCE PLAN,  PLAN STANDARD FTF       (#355.3, .16)
        GROUP INSURANCE PLAN,  PLAN STANDARD FTF VALUE (#355.3, .17)
                                       
 It is not expected that this Standard Filing Time Frame will cover all 
 possible time frames and is therefore optional.  The free text Filing Time 
 Frame currently existing will continue to be available for filing time 
 frame related comments.
                                       
 When the Company and Plan information is edited these fields will be asked. 
 For example, for a 6 month time frame the Standard Filing Time Frame would 
 be MONTH(S) and the VALUE would be 6.  The longest possible time frame 
 should be used to ensure potential billables are not lost.
                                       
    STANDARD FILING TIME FRAME: DAYS// 
    STANDARD FILING TIME FRAME VALUE: 30// 60 
    FILING TIME FRAME: 60 Days Paper, 30 Electronic
                                       
 When displayed on the various insurance information screens and reports, 
 the Standard Filing Time Frame, if set for an insurance, will be displayed 
 next to the free text Filing Time Frame and in parentheses:      
    Filing Time Frame: 60 Days Paper, 30 Electronic (60 DAYS)
                                       
 When Outpatient events are added to Claims Tracking this Standard Filing 
 Time Frame will be evaluated.  If the event date is not within the range 
 then the Reason Not Billable of FILING TIMEFRAME NOT MET will be added to 
 the entry.
                                       
 Applying a Patient's Standard Filing Time Frame
 -----------------------------------------------
 The Standard Filing Time Frame is used when adding Outpatient events to 
 Claims Tracking to identify those events outside a patient's insurance 
 filing time frame.  These events are added to Claims Tracking with a Reason 
 Not Billable of FILING TIMEFRAME NOT MET.
                                       
 To calculate a Patient's Filing Time Frame, each of the patient's active 
 insurance plans will be evaluated:
 - If the Plan has a Standard Filing Time Frame assigned then it will be used
 - If the Plan does not have a Standard Filing Time Frame assigned, then the 
   Insurance Company Standard Filing Time Frame will be used, if defined.
 - Neither the Plan nor Company have a Standard Filing Time Frame assigned 
   then for automated purposes the filing time frame will be unlimited.
                                       
 For a patient with multiple Insurance Plans the Patient's Filing Time Frame 
 will be calculated as:
 - If all companies/plans have a Standard Filing Time Frame assigned then 
   the patient's Filing Time Frame will be the longest available.
 - If any of the companies/plans does not have a Standard Filing Time Frame 
   or one has been assigned NO FILING TIME FRAME LIMIT then the patient has 
   an unlimited Filing Time Frame and no events identified as non-billable.
                                       
 Only active Companies/Plans and Medicare (WNR) will be used to calculate a 
 patient's Filing Time Frame.  Medicare is included because in some cases, 
 such as Supplemental or Secondary, an insurance company may allow their 
 time frame to be based on the date of submission to Medicare (MRA) rather 
 than the date of service.
                                       
 The nightly task that adds Outpatient Events to Claims Tracking will 
 calculate the Patient's Filing Time Frame and if an event is outside that 
 time frame it will assign the Reason Not Billable FILING TIMEFRAME NOT MET.
                                       
 Standard Filing Time Frame Conversion
 -------------------------------------
 When this patch is installed a conversion will be preformed to replace 
 existing free text Filing Time Frames with Standard Filing Time Frames if 
 they can be positively identified.
 - The company or plan must be active and not Medicare.
 - If a Standard Filing Time Frame is identified it is added and the free 
   text Filing Time Frame is deleted.

 BILL/CLAIMS:
 ============
                                       
 Skilled Nursing Facility Charges
 --------------------------------
 Skilled Nursing Facility is identified on a bill and the corresponding SNF 
 charges applied.  However this was not working correctly for stays of 1 day.
 This has been updated for stays of 1 day identified as Skilled Nursing 
 Facility will have the SNF charges applied.
                                       
 Procedure Revenue Code Links
 ----------------------------
 It is possible to link particular procedures with the revenue code that 
 should be billed.  This function allows a range of procedures to be linked 
 to a revenue code.  However this linkage did not work correctly for HCPCS 
 procedures.  This has been corrected.
                                       
                                       
 REPORTS
 =======
                                       
 Reasons Not Billable Report
 ---------------------------
 For the detailed printed RNB report the calculation of the Prosthetics and 
 Prescription unbilled amounts were modified to more accurately reflect the 
 true unbilled amounts. In particular, it takes into account any authorized 
 insurance bills for the Claims Tracking event and subtracts from the 
 unbilled amount. The Outpatient unbilled amount in the report was also 
 modified to take into consideration any authorized insurance bills for the 
 outpatient visit and subtracts it from the unbilled amount from the Claims 
 Tracking event. 
                                       
 On the detailed version of the Excel and printed report any Third Party 
 bill that could be associated with the Claims Tracking Event was added 
 under the Related Bill column for  Prescription and Prosthetics portion of 
 the report. For the Inpatient and Outpatient portions related bills were 
 added under the "Comments".
                                       
 On both the Excel and printed detailed report the new reason not billable a 
 "Next Admission" date line was added if an outpatient Claims Tracking event 
 has a "72 hour rule" reason not billable. This "Next Admission" line 
 contains the next admission for the patient if one exists
                                       
 On the Detailed Version of the Excel report the SSN field was changed to 
 only show the last four digits of the SSN. Also, an Insurance Company field 
 was added to the report which the denotes patient's primary insurance.

 Unbilled Report
 ---------------
 The outpatient amount on this report was modified to more accurately 
 reflect the unbilled amount for an outpatient Claims Tracking event. In 
 particular when the two component charges (Institutional and Professional) 
 are combined into one charge on a bill or when the two charges are included 
 in two separated bills.

 ******************** PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ********************
                                       
 The post-init of this patch converts the existing Filing Time Frame to a 
 Standard Filing Time Frame for both the Insurance (#36) and Group 
 Insurance Plan (#355.3).  If an exact match is found then the Standard 
 Filing Time Frame is added and the existing free text Filing Time Frame is 
 deleted.
                                       
 The following two FileMan searches may be run before the patch 
 installation to have available the pre-patch Filing Time Frames in case 
 of questions concerning this conversion after the patch.  These searches 
 print the insurance and their Filing Time Frame before the patch and 
 therefore before the conversion.  
                                       
 Since the results might be very lengthy (thousands of entries) it is 
 suggested the results be saved as a file rather than printed.  132 width

 ******************* POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS *******************
                                       
 Check the install file to ensure all the data updates in the post-init were 
 completed successfully. An example is given below.  In particular, there 
 are two sections that may indicate some post install actions are required. 
 Potential Post Install Actions:
                                       
 A. >> Check for the 39 Standard Reasons Not Billable (#356.8)...
 If there are any Reasons Not Billable listed in this section then your site 
 does not have all the standard Reasons Not Billable.  Contact EPS for 
 assistance.
                                       
 B. >> Inactivate Any Active Non-Standard Reasons Not Billable (#356.8,.05)
 If there are any Reasons Not Billable listed in this section contact your 
 MCCR staff to inform them these will no longer be available.
                                       
                                       
 Below is an example of the Post-init if the site has no local modifications 
 to their Reasons Not Billable.  
                                       
                                       
 Note the new NON COVERED DRUG PER PLAN and NO PHARMACY COVERAGE RNBs are 
 being exported by both this patch and IB*2*384 ePHARMACY ENHANCEMENTS.  
 The first patch installed will add the RNB, if it already exists when this 
 patch is installed then it will be recognized as existing and only the Code
 field will be updated.
