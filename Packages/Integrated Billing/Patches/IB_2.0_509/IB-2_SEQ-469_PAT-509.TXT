 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 INC000000897475 - Integrated Billing - e-Pharmacy:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Financial Services Center requests assistance to have VistA E-Pharmacy 
 connections updated. This requires a conditional update to the "BPS NCPDP"
 and "EPHARM OUT" HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) entries dependent on whether the 
 patch is being installed in a test system or production.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A post-init routine IB20P509 was created to check whether the patch was 
 installing in a test system or production and populate the TCP/IP address 
 accordingly as indicated below:
  
 Test       - 10.226.187.121
 Production - 10.224.187.16
  
 Routine: IB20P509
