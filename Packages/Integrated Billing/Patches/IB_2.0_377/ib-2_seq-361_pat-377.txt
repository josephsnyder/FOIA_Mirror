Description:
============

 This patch includes many functional enhancements to electronic billing
 and related user options.
  
 Full list of patch items:
  
 1. Option MRA Management WorkList [IBCE MRA MANAGEMENT] now allows users 
    to enter and view claim level comments for Medicare-equivalent 
    Remittance Advice (MRA) request claims. Users may also enter and view 
    an MRA review status for MRA request claims.
  
 2. Option Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]
    now allows users to enter and view MRA comments for a given claim. If
    both Accounts Receivable (AR) and MRA comments exist, AR comments are 
    displayed first, followed by MRA comments.
  
 3. Option Patient Insurance Info View/Edit [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
    now uses Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
    codes for the field PT. RELATIONSHIP TO INSURED (#16)
    in the INSURANCE TYPE multiple (#.3121) of the PATIENT file (#2):
  
         '01' FOR SPOUSE;
         '18' FOR SELF;
         '19' FOR CHILD;
         '20' FOR EMPLOYEE;
         '29' FOR SIGNIFICANT OTHER;
         '32' FOR MOTHER;
         '33' FOR FATHER;
         '39' FOR ORGAN DONOR;
         '41' FOR INJURED PLAINTIFF;
         '53' FOR LIFE PARTNER;
         'G8' FOR OTHER RELATIONSHIP;
  
    During the installation of this patch, old VistA codes are
    automatically converted into new HIPAA codes for all existing patient
    insurance policies.
  
 4. The menus, screens and actions in the option Provider ID Maintenance
    [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT] were significantly re-designed and enhanced so
    they are easier to use and understand.
  
 5. Option Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] now
    allows users to properly add non-VA providers and non-VA facilities
    from billing screen 8 for both professional and institutional claims.
    Billing screen 7 was also enhanced to allow for the entry of non-
    covered charges for procedures on institutional outpatient claims.
  
 6. Option Cancel Bill [IB CANCEL BILL] has been enhanced to display
    more Claims Tracking information when cancelling a claim in Integrated
    Billing (IB). Additional Claims Tracking data include the outpatient
    clinic name, visit date, admission date, prescription#, drug, refill
    date, and prosthetic item description. Also, users may now enter up to
    80 characters of additional free text comments into Claims Tracking.
  
 7. When Medicare sends the Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA X12
    835 transaction) into VistA and there is an indication that Medicare
    has returned the corrected patient name or the corrected patient ID#
    in the MRA, the patient's Medicare insurance policies will be updated
    with this information automatically. Also, the alert "EOB for bill #
    [claim#] indicates a new name or id exists for patient" has been
    removed from the system.
  
 8. Option Batch Status Detail Report [IBCE BATCH STATUS DETAIL] has
    been removed with this patch. It has been replaced with a new option
    called EDI Claim Status Report [IBCED EDI CLAIM STATUS REPORT].
    This new report allows users to view their electronic claim activity
    utilizing many different selection and sorting criteria.
  
 9. Option View/Print EDI Bill Extract Data [IBCE EDI VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT]
    has been enhanced with this patch. Users may now choose to display all
    of the claim's EDI segments or only selected EDI segments.
    The piece numbers are displayed next to the field name, and all of the
    field names have been updated to reflect their true HIPAA name.
  
 10. The Print Report action in the option Claims Status Awaiting
     Resolution [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING] (CSA) has been enhanced to 
     optionally display the Review Comments associated with the CSA 
     rejection messages on file. Users will be asked if they want to 
     include Review Comments with the report.
  
 11. Chiropractic data is prevented from being transmitted on an
     electronic institutional claim.
  
 12. Two new IB edit checks were added to make sure the current payer
     address is valid and also any other payer addresses are valid. A
     valid payer address contains at a minimum address line 1, city, 
     state, and zipcode.
  
 13. FL-59 on the UB-04 printed claim form is the code for the patient 
     relationship to insured.  For pharmacy claims, this patch restores the
     printed codes to the pre-HIPAA usage.  Namely, 01 for patient/self/
     cardholder, 02 for spouse, 03 for child, and 04 for other.
  
 14. A new IB edit check was added for UB-04 MRA Request claims.  For any
     line item on these claims where the modifier "GY" exists, the system
     now requires non-covered charges for that line item.

 This patch addresses the following Remedy Tickets:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD64525   IND-1204-40898   UNABLE TO MAKE BILL COMMENT ON REQUESTED
                               MRA BILL
 2. HD240240  HIPPA  X12 codes printing on claims
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ----------------------------
 1. HD64525   IND-1204-40898   UNABLE TO MAKE BILL COMMENT ON REQUESTED
                               MRA BILL
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Billers cannot add Bill Comments in TPJI when the claim is in a status of
 REQUEST MRA. The ability to add additional comments to claims is a
 needed functionality request.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch allows the billers to enter and view claim level comments for
 MRA Request claims in both the Third Party Joint Inquiry (TPJI) screen
 and in the MRA WorkList screen.
  
  
 2. HD240240  HIPPA  X12 codes printing on claims
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Paper pharmacy UB-04 claims are printing the HIPAA X12 patient 
 relationship to insured code in FL-59.  These codes are not valid for 
 pharmacy claims.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the output formatter entry for FL-59 on the UB-04 printed claim 
 form to convert the VistA internal patient relationship code to the HIPAA 
 code for non-pharmacy claims and to the National Council for Prescription 
 Drug Programs (NCPDP) code for pharmacy claims.  The valid NCPDP codes 
 are:
  
   01 - Cardholder
   02 - Spouse
   03 - Child
   04 - Other

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The pre and post installation routines are automatically deleted after
 this patch is installed.
  
 The pre-installation routine deletes changed output formatter entries in
 this build so they are installed cleanly, and it removes obsolete data
 from the patient insurance policy file, and it deletes a traditional
 x-ref in an output formatter infrastructure file.
  
 The post-installation routine runs a conversion that populates the
 patient's relationship to the policy holder information in both the
 PATIENT file (#2) and the INSURANCE BUFFER file (#355.33). It also sends
 an email message to staff at the Austin FSC so they are alerted when a
 site has installed this VistA patch.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 It is recommended that this patch be installed outside of normal working
 hours when no Integrated Billing users are on the system. However, if
 installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the following
 selections in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
     Enter/Edit Billing Information        [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
     Patient Insurance Info View/Edit      [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
     MRA Management WorkList               [IBCE MRA MANAGEMENT]

     View/Print EDI Bill Extract Data      [IBCE EDI VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT]
     Claims Status Awaiting Resolution     [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING]
  
  
 **** Do not install this patch when the IB MT NIGHT COMP background job
      is running.
  
  
 Also, make sure that electronic claims are NOT scheduled to be 
 transmitted via TaskManager while the patch is being installed. It's best 
 to check with your Billing section on this. There is a field called HOURS
 TO TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) that
 may contain specific times to transmit bills.
  
 Any future tasks set up in TaskManager based on the HOURS TO TRANSMIT 
 BILLS (#8.06) field in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) would
 appear similar to this:
  
  5310003: FORMOUT^IBCEFG7, OUTPUT FORMATTER - FORM: IB 837 TRANSMISSION.
           No device.  ACT,ACT.  From Today at 1:01,  By you.
           Scheduled for Today at 16:00
  
 If there are no specific times set up in this parameter, claims will be
 transmitted when the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT
 COMP] job runs.
  
  
 Install Time - Anywhere from 10 minutes up to 2 hours depending on the
                size of the patient database. All patient insurance
                policies are examined in both the pre-install routine and
                the post-install routine.
