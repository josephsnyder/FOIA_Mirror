Subject: FIX SUBSCRIBER ID EDIT, FILE CROSS-REFERENCE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 There are two fixes in this patch: First, in the Enter/Edit Billing 
 Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option on screen #3, all of the valid 
 SUBSCRIBER PRIMARY IDs are now allowed (one that wasn't was the letter 
 "A" followed by 6 numbers). Second, there is a fix for a bad
 cross-reference in the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3) file.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000141857  Unable to input seven digit number
  
  Problem:
  --------
  A Site reported receiving the billing edit error message of "HIC # is
  missing or invalid for patient" erroneously when attempting to process a
  third party health insurance claim in the [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine IBCBB8 to remove the wrong length check for the HIC #
  and instead call the $$VALHIC^IBCNSMM(IBXDATA) function only, which
  already contains the correct length check to validate the HIC #.
  
 2. HD0000000194804 There is a bad XREF in File #355.3
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The call to EVENT^IVMPLOG is passing in the DA variable which is the IEN
  of the entry in the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3) file as the DFN of a
  patient.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified the EVENT^IVMPLOG call in the cross-reference of the GROUP NUMBER
  (#.04) field in GROUP INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3) file to pass the DFN as a
  parameter instead.
