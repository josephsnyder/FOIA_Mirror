Subject: FIX UNDEFINED ERROR, ADD CHARGES, MRA REJECTS

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 There are three fixes in this patch: The first issue concerns an undefined
 error in the Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option
 when site entered a number greater than the default procedure unit which
 is 1. The second issue is that user cannot add charges for FEE LTC OPT
 RESPITE charge in the Cancel/Edit/Add Patient Charges [IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD
 CHARGES] option. The last issue is when a provider was inactivated in the
 NEW PERSON (#200) file and his person class was no longer valid, IB sent
 an ATT/REND PROV SPECIALTY value of 99 for the provider causing the claim
 rejection.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000100104 <UNDEFINED>PRTARR+13^IBCF23
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site is getting an undefined error at line PRTARR+13 in routine IBCF23
    when they enter the Unit of Service for the procedure which is greater
    than the default number 1 on screen <#7> in the Enter/Edit Billing 
    Information [IB ENTER BILLING INFO] option.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBCF23 to capture the charge unit associated with
    the procedure properly, thus avoiding the problem.
  
 2. HD0000000097048  Cannot add charges for FEE LTC OPT RESPITE charge
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The option Cancel/Edit/Add Patient Charges [IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES]
    did not allow an add of the DG LTC FEE OPT RESPITE NEW patient charge
    although the same charge for the date of the service has been
    cancelled.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines IBECEA3 and IBECEAU to allow the add of a new patient
    charge for the DG LTC FEE OPT or DG LTC OPT type when the same type of
    charge for the same date has been cancelled in the option.
  
 3. HD0000000064594  FAV-0105-70020  MRA Rejects with 99 Area Of
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When site deactivated the provider in the option [XUSERDEACT] and then
    entered him for a claim on screen <#8> in the option Enter/Edit
    Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO], the Prov Specialty On File
    field defaults to UNSPECIFIED that results in an invalid specialty code
    of 99 to be transmitted in EDI.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the trigger data definition in the Performed By field of
    the Provider sub-file under the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file. It will set
    the specialty code in the file if the beginning service date on the
    claim has been covered by the time of the care when the provider
    was active in the past. The specialty will reflect the Prov Specialty
    On File field in the [IB SCREEN82] input template later.

    The post-init routine IB20P402 will add a valid specialty code to the
    Entered/Not Reviewed bills when the specialty for the provider was not
    correctly set in the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file. If any are found they 
    will be listed as part of the install, otherwise not.

 5.   CLEAN UP POST-INIT ROUTINE
      --------------------------
      Optional - Once this patch has been successfully installed you may

 ROUTINE SUMMARY: 
 ================
 The post-init routine (IB20P402) is new for all sites.
  
 Because the previous patch IB*2*344 was Entered in Error after many 
 sites installed it, sites will fall into one of two situations regarding 
 the checksums for the other routines: 
  
  
 1) If your site has NEVER installed IB*2*344, the before and after
 checksums will look like this:
  
 The checksums below are new checksums, and can be checked with
 CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
  
 Routine Name: IBCF23
     Before: B38927370   After: B39555399  **52,80,106,122,51,152,137,402**

                                            312,402**
 Routine Name: IBECEAU
     Before: B13792426   After: B14113115  **91,249,402**
  
  
  
 2) If you already have IB*2*344 installed, then the before and after
 checksums will be the same number as indicated below:
