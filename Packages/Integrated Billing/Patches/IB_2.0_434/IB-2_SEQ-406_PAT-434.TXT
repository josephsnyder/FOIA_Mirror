Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*358
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*434
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*9
  
 The three patches (PSO*7*358, IB*2*434 and BPS*1*9) are being released in
 the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 5.0.  For more specific instructions please
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 The combined build will allow the processing and release of prescriptions
 for TRICARE active duty patients.
  
 This specific patch contains functionality for the following:
  
  1. The IB Billing Determination API has been modified with this
     patch, the API call is $$RX^IBNCPDP.  One of the purposes of this API
     is to determine whether or not the prescription is ECME billable.  If
     the billing determination process detects that the prescription is for
     a TRICARE eligible patient who has an inpatient status in VistA as of
     the prescription issue date, then the prescription will NOT be ECME
     billable.
  2. In the case described above, the prescription will be marked in
     Claims Tracking as non-billable with a Reason Not Billable of "TRICARE
     INPATIENT/DISCHARGE".
  3. Minor corrections are being made to the field descriptions for 2
     fields in the IB NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14).

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ------------------------
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post-installation routine is IBY434PO.  This routine will add a new
 entry into the CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8).  The
 new entry will be "TRICARE INPATIENT/DISCHARGE" with non-billable reason
 CODE (the .04 field of file #356.8) of "RX16".
  
 The post-installation routine is automatically deleted by KIDS if allowed
 by your local Kernel parameters configuration.
  
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed when users are
 not on the system and during non-peak hours.  Of particular concern would
 be the items below.
  
     1. Do not queue this installation to run at a later time because you
        will be prompted to enter information during the installation.
     2. Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY
        BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job to finish or complete the
        installation before this job starts.
     3. Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmission starts.
        Check with Pharmacy Service or your pharmacy Automated Data
        Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to find out when
        CMOP transmissions occur.
     4. If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
        following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
        descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
        the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
