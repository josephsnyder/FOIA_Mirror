Subject: E-CLAIMS - BILLING PROVIDER FOR NON-VA SERVICE FACILITY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch changes the definition of the Billing Provider for claims in
 which care was provided at a non-VA facility (commonly referred to as Fee
 Basis claims). With Integrated Billing (IB) patch 400 (E-CLAIMS -
 ADDITIONAL CLAIM FORM AND TRANSMISSION DATA), the Billing Provider for Fee
 Basis claims was defined in the requirements to be the main division in
 the database. This is not correct for some sites. The Chief Business
 Office (CBO) has requested this patch as a follow-up patch to IB patch 400
 to change this requirement for the Billing Provider for Fee Basis claims.
  
 Complete list of patch items:
  
 1. The Billing Provider for Fee Basis claims will be the division 
    on the claim rather than the main division in the database.
