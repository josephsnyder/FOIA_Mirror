Subject: REASONABLE CHARGES 3.0

Category:

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports Reasonable Charges v3.0, which contains two 
 significant updates to the Reasonable Charges (RC) definition.  
 There are no charges released with this version of Reasonable Charges.
                                       
 Elimination/Revision of the Charge Discounts
 -------------------------------------------------------
 There are four charge discounts associated with Reasonable Charges.  Each 
 of these discounts is applied to procedure charges when bill charges are 
 calculated.  It has been determined that it is standard procedure for the 
 Fiscal Intermediary to also apply these discounts.  Therefore these 
 discounts have been removed from Reasonable Charges.  VistA Billing will 
 no longer apply these discounts to bill charges:
 -  Multiple Surgical Procedures Discount
 -  Primary/Secondary Bundled Discount
 -  Provider Discount
 -  Modifier Decrease Adjustment
                                       
 The removal of the charge discounts is not date dependent, the discounts 
 will end when the patch is installed, therefore the discounts will not be 
 applied to any care billed after this patch is installed.
                                       
 Modifier Increase Adjustment:  The exception to the removal of the 
 Reasonable Charges discounts are the two Modifier Adjustments that 
 increase the charge, these will continue to be applied to bill charges: 
 - modifier 22 at 120% adjustment  (Unusual Procedural Services)
 - modifier 50 at 154% adjustment  (Bilateral Procedure)
 Any procedure associated with one of these two modifiers will continue to 
 have the corresponding charge adjustment applied to the procedure's charge 
 on the bill.
                                       
 Zero Charge Provider Discount:  Also note that the Zero Charge Provider 
 Discount for non-billable providers will continue to be available.  This 
 discount is not specific to Reasonable charges.  The Zero Charge Provider 
 Discount is a general check for non-billable provider.  So cancelling of 
 charges, or zero charge, for providers who should not be billed will 
 remain.
                                       
 Accommodation of Interim Nationally Based Charges
 -------------------------------------------------------
 CPT/HCPCS procedure codes may be updated on a quarterly schedule, new 
 codes are released and some are inactivated.  To provide charges for these 
 new codes as quickly as possible, a National Interim charge will be 
 developed for the new procedures.  These national interim charges will not 
 be locality specific, but will be the same for all sites.  The next full 
 release of Reasonable Charges will provide site specific charges for these 
 procedures.  
                                       
 To accommodate these national interim charges an enter option is 
 being provided for each site to add these charges to their Charge Master.
 The National Reasonable Charges Enter [IBCR ENTER RC NATIONAL CHARGES]
 option is added to the Charge Master Menu [IBCR CHARGE MASTER MENU].
 This option is limited to those users assigned the IB SUPERVISOR key.
                                       
 The national interim charges will be published in a document by Chief
 Business Office.  These will then be entered manually into the Charge 
 Master based on the following information provided in that document:
                                       
 Code:          Procedure CPT/HCPCS
 Effective:     Date charge becomes active/effective
 Modifier:      CPT Modifier Code, if applicable
 Charge Type:   Institutional or Professional
 Unit Charge:   Currency, standard charge per procedure unit
 Base Charge:   Currency, Anesthesia and Observation Type charges only.
                                       
 Standard:      PR, is this a Standard Type Charge, charge per procedure
 Anesthesia:    MN, Minutes, is this an Anesthesia Type Charge
 Observation:   HR, Hours, is this an Observation Type Charge
 Ambulance:     ML, Miles, is this an Ambulance Type Charge
                                       
 Inpatient:     Yes/No, is this procedure billable for Inpatient care
 SNF:           Yes/No, is this procedure billable for SNF care
 Outpatient:    Yes/No, is this procedure billable for Outpatient care
 Freestanding:  Yes/No, is this procedure billable for Non-Provider sites
                                       
 Once this data is entered for a procedure, the charge will be added to 
 each appropriate Charge Set in the Charge Master and then will be billed 
 as all other charges.
                                       
 Other Changes:  Anesthesia Minutes
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Anesthesia is billed based on a 15 minute unit.  Before this patch the 
 Reasonable Charges anesthesia unit was rounded up after 4 minutes: 1-19 
 minutes is one unit and 20-34 is two units, etc.  However this has been 
 modified to a more standard rounding algorithm.  Beginning with Reasonable 
 Charge v3.0, the anesthesia units will be based on a 15 minute unit rounded 
 up after any minutes: 1-15 minutes is one unit and 16-30 is two units, etc.
                                       
                                       
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20050417  Methodology Update Inpatient and Outpatient Reasonable Charges
                                       
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NOIS/Remedy tickets associated with this patch.
                                       
                                       
 Technical Description
 =====================
 There are 6 routines deleted with this patch (IBCRBCA*).  These routines 
 implemented 3 of the Reasonable Charges discounts: Multiple Surgical 
 Procedures Discount, Primary/Secondary Bundled Discount, Modifier 
 Adjustment/Discount.  Since these discounts are being removed from the 
 definition of Reasonable Charges, the routines and the calls to them are 
 deleted.
                                       
 The Modifier Adjustment is a special case.  There are two modifier charge 
 adjustments that increase the charge and will remain, however the process 
 of applying this modifier adjustment has been changed.  The existing 
 modifier adjustment was dependent on how the procedures were defined on 
 the bill.  Therefore, the adjustment could not be completed until all the 
 bill charges were compiled.  The modifier adjustments that will remain 
 will be applied as a simple adjustment to each charge for procedures with 
 that modifier.  So the compiled version of the modifier adjustment 
 (IBCRBCA3) is replaced with application of the adjustment as each charge 
 is calculated (IBCRBC2).
                                       
 The Provider Discounts for Reasonable Charges are also being removed. 
 However, the Zero Charge Provider Discount will remain.  Therefore the 
 logic to apply the discount must also remain.  To remove specific 
 discounts, the Group is deleted from the BILLING PROVIDER DISCOUNT 
 (#363.34) file.  The removal of the RC Provider Discounts will be 
 implemented by the Post-init.  The Post-init (IBYPSK) will delete all 
 Provider Discounts in the RC Provider Discount Special Group that were 
 nationally defined, except the ZERO CHARGE group. 
                                    
 The Post-Init (IBYPSK) deletes all Provider Discount Groups in the RC 
 PROVIDER DISCOUNTS Special Group, except the ZERO CHARGE group, in the 
 BILLING PROVIDER DISCOUNT (#363.34) file.
