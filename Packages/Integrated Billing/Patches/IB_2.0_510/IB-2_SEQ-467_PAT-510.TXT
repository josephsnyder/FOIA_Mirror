 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000894124 Need ineligible and humanitarian rate updated
  
  Problem:
  --------
  As requested by the Chief Business Office (CBO), the Humanitarian and 
  Ineligible rates need to be updated to bill a new administrative fee of
  $13.18 for third party prescription with an effective date of August 13,
  2013.

  for rate types  Humanitarian and Ineligible with an inactive date of
  August 12, 2013. It also updates the adjustments for those rate types with
  the new RX-COST charge set and the dispensing fee effective from August 
  13, 2013 in the Rate Schedule (#363) file.

  non-billable reason code: CV25 HDHP PLAN NOT BILLED in the Reason Not
  Billable list for the Claims Tracking module.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Post-init routine IB20P510 was created to inactivate the non-billable
