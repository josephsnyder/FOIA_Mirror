Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*65
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*131
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*289
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*384
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*7
   
 The last three patches (PSO*7*289, IB*2*384 and BPS*1*7) will be released 
 in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 3.0.  Patches PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 will 
 be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an implementation
 dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches, PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 must be installed prior to the 
 installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions please
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
   
 This patch modifies the Integrated Billing v2.0 application as described 
 below:
   
  
 1.  Release of Information (ROI) Identifier
 -------------------------------------------
 This patch adds functionally to support the new ROI Identifier "U" in the
 DEA SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field in the DRUG (#50) file to determine if a drug
 can be billed to a third party payer (insurance company).  Prior to this
 patch a non-billable code ("0" (zero), "9", or "M") was added to all items
 that should not be billed to avoid disclosing sensitive diagnoses for the
 following diseases: HIV, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, or sickle cell
 anemia.  With this patch drugs associated with sensitive diagnoses will
 have a "U" placed in their DEA SPECIAL HDLG field.  The new ROI will be
 used to check if an ROI is on file for the patient, and therefore be
 billable.
  
   
 2.  New Claims Tracking ROI file
 --------------------------------
 A new CLAIMS TRACKING ROI file(#356.25) documents whether an ROI is on
 file for a patient.  The Claims Tracking ROI file is maintained manually
 and indicates if a claim can be sent to third party payers for the
 particular Drug, Patient, and Insurance Company for drugs containing the
 new DEA Special Handling.
   
  
 3.  No Signed Release (ROI)
 ---------------------------
 When submitted to IB for billing determination, if it is determined that 
 an active ROI is not in the new CLAIMS TRACKING ROI file for a claim that
 has a DEA Special Handling field of "U", then the claim will be returned
 non-billable with a Non-Billable Reason of NO ACTIVE ROI ON FILE.
  
   
 4.  ROI Identifier on Screen 7
 ------------------------------
 When Autobiller creates a claim or if a claim is manually created and the 
 DEA Special Handling field of the Drug has the "U" indicator, the 
 Sensitive Flag will automatically be changed to YES on Screen 7 of the
 Billing Screen.
   
  
 5.  Prompt for ROI Tracking Data When Entering or Editing a Bill
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 When entering billing information using the menu option Enter/Edit Billing
 Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO], if the drug has a DEA Special Handling
 field of "U" and no ROI Tracking data is on file for the drug, the user
 will be prompted to enter the data from screen seven of the billing edit
 screens when the user is indicating that ROI forms have been completed.
  
   
 6.  Prevent Bill Authorization
 ------------------------------
 If a bill has the Sensitive Diagnosis question answered YES and the ROI 
 Form completed prompt answered as not YES, an error will display in the 
 National Edits error listing when the user is attempting to complete the 
 bill.  Authorization of the bill will not be allowed in this case until 
 those Fields are updated.
   
  
 7.  Submit Claim to ECME ROI Prompts
 ------------------------------------
 When using the Claims Tracking option to Submit Claim to ECME and the Drug
 has a DEA Special Handling field of "U" and no ROI Tracking data is on 
 file for the drug, the user will be prompted to enter the data related to
 the ROI.  This will allow for automatic submission of future prescriptions
 for the same patient, Drug and Insurance Company as long as the ROI is
 active within the effective dates.  Active status will be determined based
 on the effective dates.  The maximum date range for the
 effective/expiration dates permitted within the ROI file is one year.
  
   
 8.  Claims Tracking Non-Billable Reasons List
 ---------------------------------------------
 The ECME selectable list of non-billable reasons, contained in the Claims
 Tracking Non-Billable Reasons List file(#356.8), has been expanded to 
 Include the set of Service Connected/Environmental indicators.  
 Additionally a new Reason Not Billable of NO PHARMACY COVERAGE is being 
 added.  This new RNB will be utilized whenever the ePharmacy or nightly 
 Claims Tracking software determines not to bill in place of the old 
 SERVICE NOT COVERED entry to be more specific.
  
  
 9.  Copayment Information in TPJI
 ----------------------------------
 The TPJI display is updated to include Outpatient Medication Copayment
 information.  This information will appear at the bottom of the current
 TPJI display.
  
  
 10.  NON COVERED DRUGS functionality
 ------------------------------------
 This patch adds a functionally that would allow the site to stop sending 
 claims for specific drugs and specific Group plans if they were rejected 
 for specific reasons. 
 Two new fields were added to the IB SITE PARMETER file (#350.9): 
 - (#11.02) DRUG NONCOVERED RECHECK PERIOD to store the number of days to 
 re-check the "NON COVERED DRUG BY PAYER" status. If this number is zero 
 then the functionality is turned off at the site. By default this number 
 is set to zero during installation of the patch. So if the site decides 
 to use this functionality then this number needs to be set to positive 
 value.
 - (#12) NON COVERED REJECT CODES multiple field to store Reject code(s)
 returned by the payer that should be treated as NON COVERED BY PLAN
 response. The code "70" will be pre-populated by the post-install.
  
 The new IB NDC NON COVERED BY PLAN file (366.16) was introduced in this 
 patch to store the combination of drugs NDC and Group Plan ien, that was 
 rejected by payers as non-covered by plan. The software prevents sending 
 claims to payers for the Group Plan and NDC combination if it is found in 
 this file and if the last date when the NDC was rejected is not older 
 than the number of days in (#11.02) DRUG NONCOVERED RECHECK PERIOD  of 
 the IB SITE PARMETER file. If it is older then the claim will be sent to
 the payer as usual and if it is rejected again then the date in the file
 will be updated.
  
 The rejected claims will be marked in CLAIM TRACKING record with the new 
 non-billable reason "NON COVERED DRUG PER PLAN". This new item was 
 added to the  CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8)
  
 The new DRUGS NON COVERED REPORT was designed to display for users the 
 current active and expired combinations of Non Covered Drugs and Group 
 Plans. The new menu option [IB DRUGS NON COVERED REPORT] has been created 
 to access this report from IB menu [IBCNR E-PHARMACY MENU].
  
 The IB Site Parameters submenu of the menu option [IBJ MCCR SITE 
 PARAMETERS] was modify to allow the user to edit the new two fields as 
 well as another e-Pharmacy related field HIPAA NCPDP ACTIVE FLAG. These 
 fields are placed in the section[12]:
 HIPPA NCPDP Active Flag          : Active 
 Drug Non Covered Recheck Period  : 10 days(s) 
 Non Covered Reject Codes : 70 Product/Service Not Covered 
   
 These new fields had replaced the following obsolete fields in the 
 section [12]:
 Rx Billing Port:   Prim Billing Task: 
 AWP Update Port:   Sec Billing Task : 
 TCP/IP Address :   Prim AWP Upd Task: 
 Task UCI/VOL   :   Sec AWP Upd Task : 
 AWP Charge Set :   Task Started     : 
 Prescriber ID  :   Task Last Ran    : 
 DEA vs Presc.ID:   Shutdown Tasks?  : 
 Calc comp code : 
  
 11.  SERVICE CONNECTED DETERMINATION CHANGE REPORT 
 --------------------------------------------------
 The Service Connected Determination Change Report [IB SC DETERMINATION
 CHANGE RPT] was added to the Patient Billing Reports Menu [IB OUTPUT 
 PATIENT REPORT MENU]. This option creates a report with patients that have
 prescriptions and Service Connected determination changes for a specific
 time period to assist with determining if copays need to be reset.
  
 12.  INSUR^IBBAPI API modification
 --------------------------------
 IB API INSUR^IBBAPI (ICR #4419) was modified to accept the new "E" flag
 for the IBSTAT parameter (INSURANCE STATUS FILTER) to provide a new
 functionality that allows to return e-Pharmacy billable insurance plans.
