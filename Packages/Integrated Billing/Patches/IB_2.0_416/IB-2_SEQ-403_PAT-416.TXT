Description:
============

 This patch contains electronic insurance verification (eIV) enhancements 
 which are designed to improve the efficiency of the patient insurance 
 verification process while reducing the workload of the insurance clerks. 
 This is accomplished by direct, automatic updates to patient insurance 
 information (bypassing the insurance buffer), by enhanced eIV reporting 
 capabilities and enhanced user interface, and by including Medicare in 
 the insurance verification process. In addition, VistA will now be 
 able to receive, store, and display more eligibility and benefit 
 information received from insurance companies.
  
 Electronic insurance data is sent by payers and received by Austin FSC in 
 an ANSI ASC X12.282 - Eligibility, Coverage, or Benefit Information (271) 
 transaction set. This 271 data is converted to HL7 messages by Austin FSC 
 and sent into VistA. When the 271 insurance data meets the requirements 
 for the automatic updating of the patient's insurance, the insurance will 
 be updated by the system when the HL7 transmission is received. This 
 will eliminate the need for the insurance clerk to manually process this 
 information. The time lag between the receipt of the transmission and 
 the manual processing of the data will be eliminated. This functionality,
 plus the addition of Medicare to the eIV process, should significantly 
 improve the quality and timeliness of the insurance data that is used to 
 create claims for healthcare services provided to Veterans. 
  
 Complete list of patch items:
  
 1. The eIV site parameters as found in the option 'MCCR Site Parameter 
    Display/Edit' [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS] have been simplified. The 
    buffer and appointment data extracts are no longer editable and the No 
    Insurance data extract has been removed from service.
  
 2. Medicare (WNR) is now a valid insurance company for the eIV process.
  
 3. Incoming 271 insurance coverage/eligibility/benefit data may now 
    bypass the insurance buffer and be filed directly to the patient 
    insurance file if certain conditions are met.
  
 4. Much more of the 271 eligibility/benefit data will be stored in the 
    eIV Response file (file# 365) and also in corresponding fields in the 
    patient INSURANCE TYPE sub-file (sub-file# 2.312).
  
 5. Additional eIV eligibility/benefit data will be displayed in the 
    Insurance Buffer, Patient Insurance, Claims Tracking, Third Party 
    Joint Inquiry, and in the billing screens with the ?INX special help 
    action.
  
 6. The option Process Insurance Buffer [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] 
    was enhanced by the addition of several new insurance buffer data 
    views for positive responses, negative responses, Medicare buffer 
    entries, and future appointment buffer entries.
  
 7. Enhancements were made to several eIV-related reports and one new eIV 
    report was added.
  
 8. Insurance Identification inquiries have been removed from service. All 
    of the electronic insurance transactions will now be insurance 
    verification transactions. As a result, references to "IIV" have been 
    changed to be "eIV" instead.
  
 9. The process to link VistA insurance companies to VistA eIV payers in 
    the option Link Insurance Companies to Payers [IBCNE PAYER LINK] was 
    enhanced to allow the user to link multiple insurance companies to 
    a payer at one time.
  
 10. Patient IDs and subscriber IDs will have all punctuation removed and 
     will be converted into uppercase upon leaving VistA in the outbound 
     HL7 insurance verification request messages. When the patient is the 
     subscriber, the subscriber ID will be transmitted in the HL7 IN1 
     segment and no HL7 GT1 segment will be sent. When the patient is not 
     the subscriber, the patient ID will be transmitted in the HL7 IN1 
     segment and the subscriber ID will be transmitted in the HL7 GT1 
     segment.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20070582 - eIV Phase 3 Iteration 1
  
 Enables the business process to better align with the HIPAA electronic 
 requirement, as well as the following: develop the ability of eIV 
 transactions to bypass the buffer file and auto-update the insurance 
 file, controllable by payer; push verified data returned by payers to all 
 medical centers with record of patient; modify remote query to only 
 return data on active coverage; modify eIV cache to function as the basis 
 of a national insurance file. The request will meet the non-discretionary 
 mandate that VHA implement the full HIPAA 270/271 transaction for 
 Electronic Transactions under HIPAA.

 This patch addresses the following Remedy Tickets:
 --------------------------------------------------
 1. HD287430   IBCNEKIT appears to violate SACC standards
 2. HD063913   UNY-0504-10264  Error <UNDEF(ECODE)>DATA+10^IBCNERP3
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ---------------------------
 1. HD287430   IBCNEKIT appears to violate SACC standards
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Routine IBCNEKIT calls vendor specific functions to enable and disable 
 journaling during the eIV purge process. It also sets its own error trap 
 so that journaling may be re-enabled in case it crashes. Differences 
 between production systems and shadows may require database copies to 
 re-sync the pairs.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Remove all calls to disable journaling, local error trapping, and related 
 code from routine IBCNEKIT.
  
  
 2. HD063913   UNY-0504-10264  Error <UNDEF(ECODE)>DATA+10^IBCNERP3
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Original IIV software used a utility called %XY^%RCR to merge global 
 array data to/from local array data. There is a bug in this %XY^%RCR 
 utility when two or more of the array subscripts contain a comma, which
 can produce an error detect in some IIV report software.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Remove all references to the %XY^%RCR utility and replace with the 
 standard MERGE command.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The Post-Install routine is automatically deleted after this patch is
 installed.
  
 The Post-Install routine re-sets all of the eIV parameter values to the 
 new default settings, re-names some system entities to be "eIV" instead 
 of "IIV", activates and links the MEDICARE WNR payer with the 
 MEDICARE (WNR) insurance company.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
