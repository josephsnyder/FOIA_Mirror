Description:
============

 This patch updates the Place of Service (#353.1) file by adding 16 Place
 of Service codes and their associated names and abbreviations. This will
 provide an additional 16 Place of Service codes that can be selected when
 creating a CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) 1500 form.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000376723 - Add URGENT CARE as Place of Service
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the PLACE OF SERVICE (#353.1) file there is no entry for URGENT CARE.
 There should be an entry for Urgent Care (code 20) so a CMS-1500 form
 can be generated in order to properly authorize claims when they
 contain Revenue Code 456 (Urgent Care).
  
 It was determined there are a total of 16 codes that need to be added
 to the PLACE OF SERVICE (#353.1) file to bring the Integrated Billing
 program into compliance with the Place of Service list published by the
 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Post-install routine IBYP430 has been written to add the required 16 codes
 to the PLACE OF SERVICE (#353.1) file.
  
 The following 16 Place of Service codes, names, and abbreviations are
 being added:
