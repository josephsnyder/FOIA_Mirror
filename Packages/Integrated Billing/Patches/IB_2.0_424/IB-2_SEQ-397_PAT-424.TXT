 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000349027 Need New Schedules for ChampVA/ChampVA RI
  
    Problem
    -------
    The Chief Business Office (CBO) and the Health Administration Center
    (HAC) have agreed that VA can begin billing ChampVA and ChampVA 
    Reimbursable Insurance (RI) Rate Types using Reasonable Charges, as
    opposed to the current charge methodology using CMAC rates. (CMAC
    stands for CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge. CHAMPUS stands for
    Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services.) 
    This patch is required to create new Rate Schedules for
    CHAMPVA/CHAMPVA REIMB. INS. linking to Reasonable Charges and RX COST 
    (for prescription fill).
    
    Resolution
    ----------
    The post-init IB20P424 routine will automatically inactivate the 
    existing Rate Schedules for CHAMPVA and CHAMPVA REIMB. INS. with
    an inactive of 12/31/2009, and create ones with an effective date
    of 01/01/2010.
  
    The new nationally standard Rate Schedules for CHAMPVA and CHAMPVA 
    REIMB. INS. are:
  
          CVA-INPT (CHAMPVA)
          CVA-SNF (CHAMPVA)
          CVA-OPT (CHAMPVA)
          CVA-RX  (CHAMPVA)
          CVA RI-INPT (CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.)
          CVA RI-SNF (CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.)
          CVA RI-OPT (CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.)
          CVA RI-RX (CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.)
  
    After this patch is installed there will have been the inactivations
    and the addition of the 8 records listed above to the Rate Schedule
    (#363) file.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 ******** IMPORTANT NOTE ********
  
 Before installation, it's very important that you insure you don't 
 already have an EXISTING Rate Schedule named EXACTLY as any of the Rate 
 Schedules being added with this patch.  It's unlikely that you do, but if 
 so, the NEW Rate Schedule with the same name will not be added.  Prior to 
 installing this patch, please do a quick FM Inquiry into the Rate 
 Schedule file (#363) and enter "CVA" (without the quotes).
  
 If you get no matches, no further action is needed.  If any matches, make 
 sure none are named exactly like the following:
  
  
  
       CVA RI-INPT  
       CVA RI-OPT  
       CVA RI-RX  
       CVA RI-SNF  
       CVA-INPT  
       CVA-OPT  
       CVA-RX  
       CVA-SNF
  
 If you DO find any existing Rate Schedules named exactly as listed above, 
 you'll have to rename it in the Rate Schedule file before installing the 
 patch.  We suggest appending the word "OLD" to the Rate Schedule name 
 (.01 field).
