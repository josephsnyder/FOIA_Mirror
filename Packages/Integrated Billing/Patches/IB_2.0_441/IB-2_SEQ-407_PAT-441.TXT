Subject: 2011 RX COPAY THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Per forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-### - This patch MUST be installed
 before January 1, 2011. The patch is being released as an Emergency patch
 together with DG*5.3*833 (2011 Means Test Thresholds) and EAS*1.0*102
 (2011 GMT Thresholds) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to
 other released IB patches.
  
 Please Note:  We expect the VHA Directive to be titled MEANS TEST AND 
 GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2011. In order 
 to provide adequate time for sites to install, Central Business Office 
 has agreed that these patches may be released prior to availability of 
 the actual Directive Number.
  
 Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible 
 and for the pension threshold rates. These values need to be updated in 
 the associated billing files for accurate and legal billing. The purpose 
 of this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension 
 Threshold rates and the Medicare Deductible value for Calendar Year 2011.
  
 A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values. The Technical 
 section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found 
 in forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-###. If a site has already entered the
 values manually, the record will be overwritten with the national update.
  
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2011 (with an effective date 
 of 12/1/10) are defined in forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-### as:
  
 *   $ 11,830 for a single veteran without dependents
 *   $ 15,493 for a veteran with 1 dependent
 *   An additional $ 2,020 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent
  
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2011 is shown as:
  
 *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,132.
  
 This patch, IB*2.0*441 is one of three VistA 2011 threshold patches. It 
 addresses the annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds. Patch 
 DG*5.3*833 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum 
 Annual Pension Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*102 will address the annual updates for 
 the GMT Thresholds.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 The components sent with this patch IB*2.0*441 have been included in the 
 HOST File DG_53_P833.KID.  Please follow the instructions listed in the 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section of the patch description for patch 
 DG*5.3*833.  NOTE:  during the installation, please bear in mind items 1 
 and 2 below.
  
  
   1.   During installation, the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be
        checked for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
        thresholds. If there are some, the installer will be prompted to
        UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status
        may change due to the new rates.
  
        Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print.
        At the DEVICE prompt you must enter a print device. An entry is
        required and the HOME device is not allowed, neither is the
        p-Message device (this will abort the install). You MUST choose a
        valid printer. You need not queue the report since the patch will
        do so automatically.
  
   2.   Routines IB20E441 and IB20P441 may be deleted after successful
