Subject: CORRECTION TO 2010 MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The VHA Directive 2009-072 MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST 
 THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2010, published December 29, 2009, contained 
 an incorrect amount for the Medicare Deductible.  The Medicare Deductible 
 was published as $1,068 and the correct amount is $1,100.  VHA Directive 
 2009-072 was corrected and the new version was published on January 6, 
 2010 with the Medicare Deductible amount of $1,100.  Note:  Although the 
 VHA Thresholds Directive currently in effect has been modified, the 
 number associated with it remains the same as before:  2009-072.
  
 This patch is being released as an Emergency patch to update the IB ACTION
 CHARGE file (#350.2) with the correct Medicare Deductible amount.  A
 post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the file. The Medicare Deductible record with an Effective Date
 of January 1, 2010, which was added by patch IB*2.0*425, will be updated
 with the correct amount of $1,100.  The Technical section below contains
 the list of fields that will be updated and their values.
  
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
  
 File #350.2 -- IB ACTION CHARGE is updated with a corrected record.  The 
 values are as follows:
 .01  KEY                 = "MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE"
 .02  EFFECTIVE DATE      = 3100101 (internal form for January 01, 2010)
 .03  IB TRANSACTION TYPE = pointer to "MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE" in file #350.1
 .04  UNIT CHARGE, FIXED  = 1100

 unrelated to the "Exemptions Based on Prior Year Thresholds" report, 
 this report will not be run as it has been with prior installations of
 Threshold patches.
