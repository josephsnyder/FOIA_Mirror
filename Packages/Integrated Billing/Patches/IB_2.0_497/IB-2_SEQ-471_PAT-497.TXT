============

  
 **************************************************************************
 **************************************************************************
 **************************************************************************
  
 Please read this patch description in its entirety before installing. 
  
 The post installation routine of this patch contains significant data 
 conversions.  A purge of some of the eIV data files, IIV RESPONSE (#365) 
 and IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE (#365.1), greatly reduces the conversion time.
 When the purge was run at test sites prior to the install, the 
 installation of this patch took between 1-4 hours.  When the files were
 not purged prior to the install, the installation did not complete in a
 reasonable amount of time.
  
 Some sites have not purged eIV data in a long time, if ever.  There is an 
 option, Purge eIV Transactions [IBCNE PURGE IIV DATA] option, built into 
 eIV to purge data.  It allows old data to be purged, but retains at least 
 the last 6 months.  Data older than 6 months in these files is not current
 enough to be useful. There are instructions on how to run the purge later
 in this patch description.  If the files have not been recently 
 purged, this purge may result in significant journaling activity that 
 could fill up journal disks.  System managers should be made aware so 
 that journal growth can be monitored and managed accordingly.
  
 Unless your site routinely runs the purge, it is CRITICAL that the purge 
 is executed prior to the install!  The purge should NOT be run on the same
 night as the installation of this patch.
  
 If for some reason the installer does not run the purge, the conversions
 will take significantly longer and potential for journaling and 
 installation issues increase.
  
 Finally, since the post installation takes quite a while depending on the 
 site, it is IMPERATIVE that this patch is queued for installation. This is
 also explained in greater detail in the patch installation instructions
 later in this patch description.

 This Integrated Billing (IB) patch introduces substantial changes to
 VistA's electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) Eligibility Inquiry and 
 Response Processing in order to meet the Committee on Operating Rules for 
 Information Exchange (CORE) Operating Rules.
  
  
 Complete list of patch items:
  
 1.      Allow VistA to accept all X12N/5010 codes and qualifiers without 
 validation since they have already been validated by the Eligibility 
 Communicator (EC) at the Financial Services Center (FSC) in Austin prior 
 to transmission to the VA Medical Centers (VAMC).
  
 2.      Allow Vista to accept, store and display additional 
 policy/benefit information sent from payers which include Military 
 Personal Information (X12N/5010 MPI), Provider Information (X12N/5010 
 PRV) and Health Care Diagnosis Code Information (X12N/5010 HI).
  
 3.      Provide the ability for users to view the AAA Error Reporting 
 Codes and corresponding textual description in the Response Report View 
 of Process Insurance Buffer [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] when an 
 Error Reporting Code is received in response to an X12N/5010 Health Care 
 Eligibility Benefits Inquiry (270).
  
 4.      Transmit additional statistical information in the daily eIV 
 registration message (HL7 MFN message) to the FSC.
  
 5.      Transmit the NAME OF INSURED (#17) Field of the INSURANCE TYPE 
 SUB-FILE (#2.312) in the PID segment of the 270 HL7 message when the 
 patient is the subscriber and there is a value in the NAME OF INSURED 
 (#17) field. 
  
 6.      Allow VistA to receive, store and display the AAA additional 
 Error Message Text on the Response Report View of the Process Insurance 
 Buffer [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] when received in an X12N/5010 
 Health Care Eligibility Benefits Response.
  
 7.      A new option, Update Subscriber Info [IBCN UPDATE SUBSCRIBER 
 INFO], required to be scheduled upon installation, which updates 
 subscriber fields in the INSURANCE TYPE SUB-FILE (#2.312), with the 
 values stored in the PATIENT FILE (#2), when the PT. RELATIONSHIP -  
 HIPAA (#4.03) field is self (18) and the field is blank and the insurance 
 policy is Active. The option will then be added to the MCCR SYSTEM 
 DEFINITION MENU [IB SYSTEM DEFINITION MENU] and require the IB SUPERVISOR
 key for future periodic use.
  
 8.      Remove Data from 11 Default Service Types codes stored in the IB
 SITE PARAMETERS FILE (#350.9) and replace with the default SERVICE TYPE
 CODE 30 - Health Benefit Plan Coverage.
  
 9.      Remove any site selected service type codes from the IB SITE
 PARAMETERS FILE (#350.9).
  
 10.     Remove Medicare Insurance Intake option [IBCN MEDICARE INSURANCE 
 INTAKE].
  
 11.     A new Worklist/report, Medicare Potential COB Worklist [IBCNE
 POTENTIAL COB LIST], of those patients whom Medicare has identified in a
 271 HL7 response message as having insurance subsequent to their Medicare
 insurance.
  
 12.     Provide the ability for users to select an eligibility date for 
 the Request Electronic Insurance Inquiry [IBCNE REQUEST INQUIRY] that is
 within the last 12 months or the end of the current month, defaulting to
 today's date if left blank.
  
 13.     Creation of Data Dictionary fields to allow the storage of 
 X12N/5010 Health Care Eligibility Benefits Response (271) data elements 
 to better align with HIPAA data lengths.  Since many of the requested 
 fields part of Integration Control Registration Agreements (DBIA) with 
 other VistA Packages, the use of the larger storage capabilities will be 
 unavailable until the subscribing packages have sufficient time to be 
 remediated.
  
 14.     Reports and screen displays were modified to allow the display of 
 increased field lengths above.  Even though most of the increased field 
 lengths will not be available until other packages using these fields are 
 remediated, the reports and screen needed to be changed to allow for that 
 eventuality.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  
 1.      As part of the requirement to accept all X12 codes and qualifiers 
 already validated prior to being sent to VistA in the 271 transaction 
 from FSC's Eligibility Communicator, a number of data elements contained 
 in entries in the IIV RESPONSE file (#365) and in the INSURANCE TYPE 
 sub-file (#2.312) of the PATIENT file (#2) need to be converted from a 
 SET OF CODES to POINTERS to specific code entries in the various X12 
 files.    The post-install implements this data conversion.  It first 
 converts the entries the IIV RESPONSE (#365) file and then continues with 
 the entries in the INSURANCE TYPE (#2.312) sub-file.   
  
 Although entries in the INSURANCE TYPE (#2.312) file CANNOT be purged, it 
 is strongly recommended that any entries in the IIV RESPONSE file (#365) 
 that are older than 6 months be purged.  This purge can have a 
 significant impact on how long it takes to run the install with respect 
 to the data conversion depending when the last time this file was 
 purged.  In some cases it has never been purged and contains almost ten 
 years of response data.  Please refer to the pre-installation 
 instructions for performing the purge.
  
 2.      In order to satisfy the requirement of being able to store longer 
 fields, a number of fields needed to be duplicated and the post-install 
 will copy data from the shorter fields to the new, longer fields.
  
 3.      A one-time subscriber update utility must be scheduled upon 
 installation of the patch. Unless the installation is queued, the 
 post-install will prompt the installer of the patch to schedule this 
 activity for off-hours.  If the installation is queued, the new update 
 utility will be scheduled for Tomorrow at 9 PM.   This is in order to 
 give the conversions time to complete. NOTE: This part of the process
 does NOT require that IB users be off the system, or un-scheduling of
 the eIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] option.
  
 4.      The eIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] option will 
 need to be unscheduled before performing the installation of the patch.  
 Once the installation and post-install conversion procedures are 
 completed, the option will need to be rescheduled.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
  
 The following 2 tasks should be performed before installing IB*2*497.
  
 1.      Purge eIV Transactions [IBCNE PURGE IIV DATA] option
 ----------------------------------------------------
 To help reduce the time it takes to perform the installation due 
 to the data conversion, it is strongly recommended that a day or 
 two before installing the patch, the Purge eIV Transactions [IBCNE PURGE 
 IIV DATA] option should be run in order to purge the eligible response
 records.  This option schedules the purge to run at 8 pm TODAY.  If it
 is already past 8 PM today, it should start up almost immediately.
  
 Note:  Please make sure the purge has completed prior to running the 
 install. The purge process does NOT require that IB users be off the
 system, or un-scheduling of the eIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH
 PROCESS] option.
   
  
 Example of running the eIV option below: 
  
 Select OPTION NAME: IBCNE PURGE IIV DATA       Purge eIV Transactions
 Purge eIV Transactions
  
  
         Purge Electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) Data Files
  
  
  This option will allow you to purge data from the eIV Response File 
 (#365) and the eIV Transmission Queue File (#365.1).  The data must be at
 least six months old before it can be purged.  Only insurance transactions
 that have a transmission status of "Response Received", "Communication
 Failure", or "Cancelled" may be purged.  You will be allowed to select a
 date range for this purging.  The default beginning date will be the date
 of the oldest eligible record in the system.  The default ending date will
 be six months ago from today's date.  You may modify this default date
 range.  However, you may not select an ending date that is more recent
 than six months ago.
  
 Enter the purge begin date: 10/10/2003//   (OCT 10, 2003)
  
   Enter the purge end date: 03/05/2013//   (MAR 05, 2013)
  
  
  You want to purge all eIV data created between 10/10/2003 and 03/05/2013.
  
  OK to continue? NO// YES
  
  Task# 155226 has been scheduled to purge the eIV data tonight at 8:00 PM.
  
  
 2.      eIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] option
        ----------------------------------------------------      
 Since the installation of this patch could take a number of hours 
 to complete due to the conversion procedures, it will be necessary to 
 unschedule the eIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] option 
 before installing the patch.  An example of unscheduling this task 
 below:
  
 Select Taskman Management <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: SCHEDule/Unschedule 
 Options
  
 Select OPTION to schedule or reschedule: IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS       
 eIV NIGHT LY PROCESS

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
  
 It is *strongly* recommended that this patch be installed outside of
 normal working hours.  This patch contains multiple file/field conversions
 and running time depends on a number of factors. Running time could be
 anywhere from a couple hours to numerous hours to install.  Instructions
 are provided for running install in background.
  
 **** NO INTEGRATED BILLING USERS SHOULD BE ON THE SYSTEM DURING 
 INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH. ****
  
 **** Do not install this patch when the eIV NIGHTLY PROCESS [IBCNE IIV 
 BATCH PROCESS] background job is running or scheduled to run. Please refer
 to the Pre-installation instructions for the unscheduling of this
 option.****
  
 There are no additional menu options to disable.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #(
     IB*2.0*497):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? YES//'    
     
     Options are being added as well as removed, so Rebuilding Menu Trees 
     is recommended.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//'
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO// 
  
     Again, no Integrated Billing Users should be on the system and install
     Should occur outside of normal working hours.
  
 8.  A one-time subscriber update utility must be scheduled upon 
     installation of the patch. During installation, the post-install
     routine prompts for the installer to schedule the one time subscriber
     update utility and will not complete installation until it is
     scheduled. If the install is queued to run, it will automatically
     schedule this utility to run TOMORROW @ 9PM.  ***Queuing install is
     strongly recommended*** 
  
  
 ******** INSTRUCTION FOR QUEUEING INSTALL *************************
  
 8a.  At the 'DEVICE:' prompt, enter 'Q' for Queue to run this in 
      background. You will then be prompted for 'DEVICE:' again.  This is
      for where you would like the output from the Queued install to be
      directed.  You may enter NULL, HFS, or any other DEVICE that allows
      it to be accessed from a Queued job.   If you choose not to queue the
      install, there is a good chance that this install will not complete
      without experiencing a network timeout and will need to be
      restarted.  While it was written so that the post-install could pick
      up where it left off, the post-install conversion needs to complete
      as close to the install which includes the data dictionary changes as
      possible.
  
 ******** INSTRUCTION FOR RUNNING INSTALL IN FOREGROUND **************
  
 8b.  At the 'DEVICE' prompt, hit the return key which will enable the 
      Install to run in the foreground.  Installation results are displayed
      to the screen.  The prompt to schedule the one-time subscriber update
      utility is issued to the installer.  The following shows an example
      of the message and then the date/time prompt that is generated:
  
  
 Creating Task to update the Insurance Type File... 
 *************************** IMPORTANT!! ********************************
 This option will scan through the entire Patient File for patients with 
 insurance where the relationship to insured is self.  Certain fields in 
 Insurance Type sub-file will be updated to match the patient data if it 
 does not already exist.  This will take a while and must be queued to run
 in the background when there are few users on the system. The default is
 Tomorrow at 9:00 p.m. AGAIN PLEASE NOTE: This tasked job does NOT require
 that IB users be off the system, or un-scheduling of the eIV NIGHTLY
 PROCESS [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] option when it runs.
  
 Enter date/time to queue the option: T+1@2100//
  
 Update Subscriber Information Scheduled for SEP 06, 2013@21:00
  
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
  
 1. In order to verify the post-install routine was run successfully,
    please examine the patch entry in the INSTALL file and report any error
    messages to Product Support.
  
 2. After the installation has completed, and if allowed by your Kernel 
    site parameter configuration, confirm the post-install routine,
    IBY497PO, was removed.
  
 3. Once the patch has COMPLETED INSTALLATION, which can take several 
    hours, reschedule the eIV NIGHTLY PROCESS [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS]
    option that was unscheduled at pre-installation.
