 in the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) New Standards and Operating Rules 
 environment and includes annual External Code List (ECL) updates into
 NCPDP fields.
  
 The package also provides the ability to alert the pharmacist at the time of
 prescription processing regarding the days' supply benefit.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. Action RX ECME Information in option IBJ Third Party Joint Inquiry 
    [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] is modified to display an additional

       so that there is no check to see if the drug/plan is stored in the
       IB NDC NON COVERED BY PLAN file (#366.16).
  
 3. Several files and fields are decommissioned by the post-install routine 
    IBY494PO for this patch:

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------ 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext>
  
  
 The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library at:

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named
 POST^IBY494PO. The purpose of the post-install routine is to perform 
 the decommissioning described above.
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if
 allowed by your Kernel site parameters configuration.  You may delete 
 routine IBY494PO if the installation was successful and it is not 
 automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should take less than a minute to install.
  
 DO NOT QUEUE the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted. Of particular concern are the options below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked. Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
     --------------

                     download.vista.domain.ext
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific

        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext
