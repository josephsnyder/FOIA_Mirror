 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 HD0000000343530 - Add treating specialty.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The new Observation Treating Specialty below is being added to the 
 SPECIALTY FILE (#42.4) by patch DG*5.3*813.  Within Reasonable
 Charges most Inpatient charges are based on the DRG for the care
 provided.  However Observation billing is based on procedures and 
 the time in observation.   Therefore Observation care billing should
 not be associated with a DRG.

   ----  -------------------------   
   1J    ED OBSERVATION|TAB|  
   
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The new ED OBSERVATION Treating Specialty will be added to the list
 of Treating Specialties exempt from the automatic Diagnostic Related 
 Grouper (DRG) charge calculation to reduce the possibility that it will be
 incorrectly billed the DRG per diem.
