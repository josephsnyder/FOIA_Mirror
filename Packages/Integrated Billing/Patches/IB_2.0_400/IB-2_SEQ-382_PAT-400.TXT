============

 ************************************************************************
                    *** Important Installation Reminder ***
  
 After installing this patch, at least one Pay-to Provider must be entered
 into the IB site parameters. This may be done by users who hold the IB
 SUPERVISOR security key and by going to option MCCR Site Parameter
 Display/Edit [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS], select IB, then Edit Set# 10.
  
 Per CBO, please use the Legal Business Name (LBN) for the Pay-to Provider
 listed in the NPI website under the CBO Gold Standard File:
  
      http://vaww.vistau.med.va.gov/vistau/npi/#LBN
  
 ************************************************************************
  
 This patch introduces several substantial changes to the local printing
 of claim forms (CMS-1500 and UB-04) and to the electronic transmission of
 claims. Support has been added for several new fields on both the
 printed and transmitted claims.
  
 The Integrated Billing (IB) definition of the Billing Provider is being
 changed with this patch. In the health care industry, the Billing
 Provider is the entity submitting the claim to the payer. Current and
 future implementations of the X12 837 format specify that the Billing
 Provider should be identified at the lowest level of National Provider
 Identification (NPI) enumeration for a health care organization. In the
 VA, the lowest level of NPI enumeration includes clinics and pharmacies.
 Therefore, the Billing Provider for the VA may include Community Based
 Outpatient Clinics and Outpatient Pharmacies, in addition to VA Medical
 Centers and Regional Office Centers, depending upon where the health care
 was provided.
  
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) has identified eight (8) valid Billing
 Provider facility types as defined in the FACILITY TYPE file (#4.1).
 They are:
  
    VAMC     VA Medical Center
    M&ROC    Medical and Regional Office Center
    RO-OC    Regional Office - Outpatient Clinic
    OC       Outpatient Clinic (Independent)
    HCS      Health Care System
    CBOC     Community Based Outpatient Clinic
    OPC      Out Patient Clinic
    PHARM    Pharmacy
  
 If health care is provided at a VA institution which is one of these
 facility types, then the Billing Provider for the given claim will be
 that particular VA institution. In these cases, the service facility
 for electronic claims (i.e. X12-837-2310D/E) will be blank. However,
 the service facility for locally printed professional claims (i.e.
 CMS-1500, Box 32) will continue to be populated with the location of
 service.
  
 WHEN BILLING FOR SERVICE PROVIDED AT A CBOC LOCATION, there is a risk that
 payers may not recognize the service facility or practitioners associated
 with that location. This may cause your claims to be rejected or denied
 or remitted to the CBOC in error. The Chief Business Office (CBO)
 maintains a Watch List of payers that may require CBOC registration and
 has attempted to alert payers of Billing Provider changes implemented with
 Patch 400. If you suspect that these issues have affected your payments
 please take the following action:
  
   1-ALERT the VHA CO NPI Mailbox (vhaconpi@va.gov) immediately so that
     team can determine how to address your payer's issue through VistA
     solutions delivered with Patch 400 and the payer is added to the Watch
     List, and
   2-Ensure that payment is transferred to the Parent Pay-To Provider
     organization.
  
 Complete list of patch items:
  
 1. Support for multiple Pay-to Providers is being added with this patch.
    The Pay-to Provider is the VA Institution to which payment should be
    sent. Previously, the Pay-to Provider was defined as a single entity
    in the IB Site Parameters as the Agent Cashier.
  
 2. The Agent Cashier fields in the IB Site Parameters are being
    inactivated and the data deleted.
  
 3. On the CMS-1500 claim form, the data in boxes 32 (service facility
    location) and 33 (billing provider) have been re-built using the new
    definitions of the service facility and the billing provider.
  
 4. On the UB-04 claim form, FL-1 (billing provider) and FL-2 (Pay-to
    Provider) have been re-built using the new definitions of the billing
    provider and the Pay-to Provider.
  
 5. On the UB-04 claim form, support has been added for FL-56 (billing
    provider NPI) and FL-57 (billing provider secondary IDs).
  
 6. On the UB-04 claim form, support has been added for FL-70a-c for up
    to three Patient's Reason for Visit (PRV) diagnosis codes.
  
 7. On the UB-04 claim form, support has been added for FL-71 for the
    Prospective Payment System (PPS) code.
  
 8. On the UB-04 claim form, support has been added for FL-72a-c for up
    to three External Cause of Injury (ECI) codes. These are the ICD-9
    diagnosis E-codes. The POA indicator is supported for inpatient
    claims for all three ECI codes.
  
 9. For the electronic claim transmission, the "PRV" segment has been re-
    built using the new definition of the billing provider. The "PRV"
    segment now appears multiple times per EDI claim batch for each claim
    listed in the batch.
  
 10. For the electronic claim transmission, the "PRV1" segment has been
     added as the Pay-to Provider information for each claim listed in
     the batch.
  
 11. For the electronic claim transmission, the "SUB" segment has been
     re-built using the new definition of the service facility for each
     claim listed in the batch.
  
 12. For the electronic claim transmission, 10 new fields have been added
     to the "CL1A" segment for the diagnosis codes and qualifiers for the
     PPS, admitting diagnosis, and up to three PRV diagnoses.
  
 13. For the electronic claim transmission, fields in the "NPI" segment
     have been updated for the NPIs and taxonomy codes for the billing
     provider, service facility, and Pay-to Provider using the new
     definition of these entities.
  
 14. New IB error messages have been created for this patch to ensure
     that required fields for the billing provider and Pay-to Provider
     are present before the claim may be authorized.
  
 15. For UB-04 claims, the number of allowable diagnosis codes has been
     increased. UB-04 claims may now have up to 24 other diagnosis codes
     and up to 3 ECI codes in addition to the single principle diagnosis
     code.
  
 16. For CMS-1500 claims, there may now be up to 3 ECI codes present on
     the claim.
  
 17. The "?ID" special help action in the billing screens has been
     enhanced to display the Billing Provider and Service Facility name,
     NPI, tax ID, and secondary IDs using the new definition of these
     entities.
  
 18. For the purposes of provider ID maintenance, the default division
     will be the main division in the database and not the DEFAULT
     DIVISION field (#1.25) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9).
  
 19. The processing of incoming EDI messages was simplified by removing
     an unnecessary call to TaskManager in routine IBCESRV1. With this
     patch, the currently running MailMan server process will continue to
     complete the processing of the incoming EDI message. See Remedy
     ticket# 252606 description below.
  
 20. Three additional values for the TYPE OF ADMISSION field (#158) in
     the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) have been added. NEWBORN, TRAUMA, and
     INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE have been added as acceptable values for
     this field. This information is printed in FL-14 on the UB-04 and
     transmitted in piece 23 of the CL1 segment.
  
 21. Three new UB-04 Value Codes are being added with this patch.
  
       80 - COVERED DAYS
       81 - NON-COVERED DAYS
       82 - CO-INSURANCE DAYS
  
 22. If sites determine that certain payers cannot accommodate the new
     billing provider/service facility definitions, then sites may switch 
     back to the pre-patch 400 definitions through the use of two new 
     parameters in the Insurance Company Entry/Edit option [IBCN INSURANCE
     CO EDIT]:
  
        Always use main VAMC as Billing Provider (1500)?: 
        Always use main VAMC as Billing Provider (UB-04)?: 
  
     The CBO should be contacted before utilizing these parameters for any
     payer.
  
 23. Existing insurance company parameter "Send VA Lab/Facility IDs or
     Facility Data for VAMC?" and new insurance company parameter "Use the 
     Billing Provider (VAMC) Name and Street Address?" will only be 
     activated if that particular payer is utilizing the pre-patch 400 
     switchback flag for either form type.
  
 24. If a site has constructed any local output formatter overrides for
     any print field that is included in this patch, or for any EDI field 
     (with the exception of EDI fields CL1-15 Admission Hour or CL1-17 
     Discharge Hour), then those local output formatter overrides will be
     archived and deleted upon patch installation. The local output
     formatter override data will be archived to an email message sent to
     members of mail groups G.PATCHES and G.IB EDI.
  
 25. The "*FORM TYPE" field (#.14) in the INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36) was
     inactivated with IB patch 349 in July 2007. This field is being
     deleted with this patch.
  
 26. Box 33 on the locally printed CMS-1500 claim form will be populated
     with the calculated billing provider name and the billing provider
     NPI. The address, city, state, zipcode, and phone# in Box 33 will be
     taken from the Pay-to provider information.
  
 27. The VistA option 'Insurance Company EDI Parameter Report' [IBCN 
     INSURANCE EDI REPORT] was enhanced. Users may now select an additional
     sort criteria for this report:  Use VAMC as Billing Provider. This is
     the insurance company ID parameter which defines the billing provider
     and service facility by insurance company and form type (see #22
     above). This data is displayed in a new column in this report.
  
 28. New VistA option 'Insurance Company Billing Provider Flag Rpt/Msg' 
     [IBCN INS BILL PROV FLAG RPT] is being released with this patch. This 
     option is designed to be scheduled by TaskManager and does not exist
     on any parent menus. It produces a monthly report of insurance
     companies which are in pre-patch 400 switchback mode and emails this
     report to a pre-defined CBO email address. The patch post-install
     routine automatically schedules this option in TaskManager.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There are no New Service Requests associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Tickets:
 --------------------------------------------------
 1. HD252606   EDI BATCHES Waiting Transmit After 1 day
 2. HD224778   UB-04 Claims being rejected by payers
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ---------------------------
 1. HD252606   EDI BATCHES Waiting Transmit After 1 day
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Minneapolis reported a constant problem with EDI claim batches not being
 confirmed as having been received in Austin. In fact, Austin did receive
 every EDI claim batch and transmitted back to VistA the EDI claim batch
 acknowledgement message every time. However, the way in which the EDI
 messages were being processed by the MailMan server option did not work
 at Minneapolis and many EDI messages were not processed properly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine IBCESRV is the main routine for processing incoming EDI messages
 into VistA. This routine is invoked by MailMan as a background
 TaskManager task to process incoming EDI messages. The IBCESRV1 routine
 was previously invoking TaskManager once again to let another background
 task complete the filing of the EDI messages. This is not necessary and
 is not compatible with the multiple Cache server nodes running
 TaskManager at some sites. So the resolution to this issue is to simply
 let the first background task continue to process the EDI message to
 completion and do not invoke TaskManager a second time.
  
 2. HD224778   UB-04 Claims being rejected by payers
  
 Problem:
 --------
 At VISN integrated VistA database facilities, the UB-04 FL-1 is populated 
 with the name of the primary facility only. Care is provided at various 
 facilities within the VISN. Insurance payers are rejecting bills if FL-1
 does not contain the name of the treating facility that rendered the care.
 FL-56 is populated with the NPI number of the primary facility vs the NPI
 of the treating facility or the Pharmacy that provided the prescription
 service. Both FL-1 and FL-56 should display the name and NPI of the
 treating facility.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 IB patch 400 changes the definition of the Billing Provider in VistA. 
 The treating facility will generally be defined as the Billing Provider
 and thus that information will automatically populate in both FL-1 for the
 Billing Provider name and address and in FL-56 for the Billing Provider
 NPI.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Both the Pre-Install routine and the Post-Install routine are
 automatically deleted after this patch is installed.
  
 The Pre-Install routine deletes local output formatter overrides for 
 print fields that are included with this build. It also deletes changed 
 output formatter entries included with this build so they are installed 
 cleanly.
  
 The Post-Install routine populates several new fields and builds several
 new cross references. It also deletes or inactivates several obsolete
 fields and removes obsolete data, cross references, and FileMan
 triggers. The Post-Install routine may take a very long time to run
 since it needs to build new cross-references and install new data for
 entries in the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) and also for entries in the IB
 BILL/CLAIMS PRESCRIPTION REFILL file (#362.4).
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================

 **** Do not install this patch when the IB MT NIGHT COMP background job
      is running.
  
 Also, make sure that electronic claims are NOT scheduled to be
 transmitted via TaskManager while the patch is being installed. It's best
 to check with your Billing section on this. There is a field called HOURS
 TO TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) that
 may contain specific times to transmit bills.
  
 Any future tasks set up in TaskManager based on the HOURS TO TRANSMIT
 BILLS (#8.06) field in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) would
 appear similar to this:
  
  5310003: FORMOUT^IBCEFG7, OUTPUT FORMATTER - FORM: IB 837 TRANSMISSION.
           No device.  ACT,ACT.  From Today at 1:01,  By you.
           Scheduled for Today at 16:00
  
 If there are no specific times set up in this parameter, claims will be
 transmitted when the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT
 COMP] job runs.
  
  
 Install Time - Up to 3 hours for larger sites. Our test sites reported the
 following installation times:
  
 Spokane                       48 minutes
 Heartland East (St. Louis)    3 hours, 54 minutes (*)
 Heartland West (Kansas City)  1 hour, 58 minutes
 Tennessee Valley HCS          55 minutes
 Upstate New York HCS          2 hours, 40 minutes
 Central Plains                2 hours, 12 minutes
  
 (*) Heartland East (St. Louis) initially installed an earlier version of
 the patch. The processing time of the patch post-installation routine was
 shortened in subsequent versions.
