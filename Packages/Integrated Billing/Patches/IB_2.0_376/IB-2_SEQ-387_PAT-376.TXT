Subject: FIX CLAIMS REJECTIONS, CLOSED BILLS STILL SHOWING

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the extract code for the Date of Similar Illness and
 adds a cross-reference to update the "ON HOLD DATE" cross-reference after
 a patient merge to stay consistent with the new patient's info.
  
 Note: There are no routines in this patch.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1)  HD0000000180741 Date of same or similar illness is defaulting
                     in VistA to the date of service, which is
                     leading to claim rejections.
                         
  Problem: 
  --------
  The EXTRACT CODE (#1) for the Date of Same or Similar Illness in the
  IB DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION (#364.5) file is defaulting in VistA to
  the date of service, which is leading to claim rejections. 
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modify the EXTRACT CODE (#1) in the IB DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION
  (#364.5) file to use the dates linked to the occurrence codes 1-5, 10 and
  11 if they are available.  If those dates aren't available then it will
  default to the date of service.
  
 2) HD0000000155308 ON HOLD xref not updated with PATIENT MERGE
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  Even though the Patient DFN is used as a subscript for the "AHDT"
  cross-reference in the INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION (#350) file 
  when this field is updated this cross-reference is not updated
  which leaves a "hanging" cross-reference with the old Patient DFN.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A new cross-reference is added under PATIENT field (#.02) in the
  INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION (#350) file called "AHDT2" that deletes 
  the old "AHDT" cross-reference and rebuilds it with the new one.

 Installation Note:
  
 This patch does not distribute routines; however, during the installation 
 you will see the following four lines:
  
 The following Routines were created during this install:
      IBXA
      IBXA1
      IBXA2
  
 The routines listed are not exported as part of the patch. When the
 patch is installed the routines are triggered which compile the 
 cross-references for file #350. When these cross-references are utilized,
 it is these routines that build the actual xrefs. In other words, 
 this is not something to worry about.
