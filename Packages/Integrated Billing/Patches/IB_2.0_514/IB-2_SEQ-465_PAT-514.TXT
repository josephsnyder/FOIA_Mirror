Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 *  Per VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST  *
 *  AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL RATES OF PENSION FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2014, this      *
 *  patch MUST be installed before January 1, 2014. The patch is being    *
 *  released as an Emergency patch together with DG*5.3*875 (2014 Means   *
 *  Test Thresholds) and EAS*1.0*114 (2014 GMT Thresholds) and may be     *
 *  installed out of sequence with respect to other released IB patches.  *
 **************************************************************************
  
   
 Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible and
 for the pension threshold rates. These values need to be updated in the
 associated billing files for accurate and legal billing. The purpose of
 this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension Threshold
 rates and the Medicare Deductible value for Calendar Year 2014.
  
 A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values. The Technical 
 section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found in
 VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST AND
 MAXIMUM ANNUAL RATES OF PENSION FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2014. If a site has
 already entered the values manually, the record will be overwritten with
 the national update.
   
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2014 (with an effective date of
 12/1/13) are defined in VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-
 BASED MEANS TEST AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL RATES OF PENSION FOR CALENDAR YEAR 
 2014 as:
   
  *   $ 12,652 for a single veteran without dependents
  *   $ 16,569 for a veteran with 1 dependent
  *   An additional $ 2,161 for each additional dependent beyond 1 
      dependent
   
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2014 is shown as:
   
  *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,216.
   
 This patch, IB*2.0*514, is one of three VistA 2014 threshold patches. It 
 addresses the annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds. Patch 
 DG*5.3*875 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum
 Annual Pension Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*114 will address the annual updates for
 the GMT Thresholds.

 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 NOTE:  during the installation, please bear in mind items below.
   
  1.  During installation, the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be
      checked for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
      thresholds. If there are some, the installer will be prompted to
      UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status may
      change due to the new rates.
    
      Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print. At the
      DEVICE prompt you must enter a print device. An entry is required and
      the HOME device is not allowed; neither are the P-Message device or
      Spooler device (this will abort the install). You MUST choose a valid
      printer. You need not queue the report since the patch will do so
      automatically.
