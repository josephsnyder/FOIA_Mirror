 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. H00000000251539 - Change Assignment of Benefits code for TRICARE claims
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In the [IBCE EDI VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT] option, the Chief Business Office
    has requested to send an "A" in the Medicare Assignment Code field when
    the RATE TYPE field (#.07) of the BILL/CLAIM file (#399) is set to
    TRICARE or TRICARE REIMB. INS. and the TYPE OF COVERAGE field (#.13) of
    the INSURANCE COMPANY file (file #36) is set to TRICARE.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The FORMAT CODE field (#1) for entry (IEN #193) in the IB FORM FIELD
    CONTENT (#364.7) file with the associated routine IBEFUNC have been
    modified to send an "A" in the Medicare Assignment Code field when the
    Rate Type on the claim is TRICARE or TRICARE REIMB. INS. and the 
    Coverage Type for the payer is TRICARE.
  
  
 2. HD0000000064229 - COPAY RX/BILL INQUIRY
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an RX Copay is entered through the [IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES] 
    option, RX information for a wrong patient is sometimes displayed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBOLK to check a prescription for the charge existing
    in the soft link when it retrieves the prescription information for
    the patient.
  
  
         ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ================= 
  
 It is recommended that this patch be installed outside of normal business
 hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.
  
 **** Do not install this patch when the IB MT NIGHT COMP background job
      is running.
  
 Also, make sure that electronic claims are NOT scheduled to be transmitted
 via TaskManager while the patch is being installed. It's best to check
 with your Billing section on this. There is a field called HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) that may
 contain specific times to transmit bills.
  
 Any future tasks set up in TaskManager based on the HOURS TO TRANSMIT
 BILLS (#8.06) field in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) would appear
 similar to this:
  
  5310003: FORMOUT^IBCEFG7, OUTPUT FORMATTER - FORM: IB 837 TRANSMISSION.
           No device.  ACT,ACT.  From Today at 1:01,  By you.
           Scheduled for Today at 16:00
  
 If there are no specific times set up in this parameter, claims will be
 transmitted when the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT
 COMP] job runs.
