Subject: 2008 RX COPAY THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NOTE: The Health Eligibility Center (HEC)  will install Patch
 IVMB*2.0*925 (IY 2007 MT/GMT/RX THRESHOLDS) before January 1, 2008.
  
 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2007-042 - This patch MUST be installed before January 
 1, 2008. The patch is being released as an emergency patch (together with 
 DG*5.3*768 (2008 Means Test Thresholds) and EAS*1.0*85 (2008 GMT 
 Thresholds) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to other
 released IB patches.
  
 Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible 
 and for the pension threshold rates.  These values need to be updated in 
 the associated billing files for accurate and legal billing.  The purpose 
 of this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension 
 Threshold rates and the Medicare Deductible value for calendar year 2008.
  
 A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values.  The Technical 
 section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found 
 in VHA Directive 2007-042.  If a site has already entered the values 
 manually, the record will be overwritten with the national update.
  
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year (CY) 2008 (with an effective date 
 of 12/1/07) are defined in VHA Directive 2007-042, dated December 18, 
 2007 as:
  
 *   $ 11,181 for a single veteran without dependents
 *   $ 14,643 for a veteran with 1 dependent
 *   An additional $ 1,909 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent
  
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2008 is shown as:
  
 *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,024.
  
 This patch, IB*2.0*379 is one of three VistA 2008 threshold patches. It 
 addresses the annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds. Patch 
 DG*5.3*768 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum 
 Annual Pension Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*85 will address the annual updates for 
 the GMT Thresholds.

   2.   During installation, the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be
        checked for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
        thresholds.  If there are some, the installer will be prompted to
        UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status
        may change due to the new rates.
  
        Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print.
        At the DEVICE prompt you must enter a print device.  An entry is
        required and the HOME device is not allowed, neither is the
        p-Message device (this will abort the install).  You must
        choose a valid printer. You need not queue the report since the
        patch will do so automatically.
  
   3.   Routines IB20E379 and IB20P379 may be deleted after successful
        installation of this patch.
