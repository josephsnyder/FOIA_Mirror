Description:
============

 This patch is dependent on patch XU*8*480. IB*2*391 should be installed 
 immediately after XU*8*480 in your production account to prevent data 
 corruption.
  
 Patch XU*8*480 creates a new security key XUSNPIMTL, and assigns it to 
 anyone who has access to the options that allow them to edit the NPI 
 field on a VA Provider in the NEW PERSON file #200.
  
 A person can work as both a VA Provider and a non-VA Provider at the same 
 time. In that case their NPI number should be the same in both the NEW 
 PERSON file and the non-VA provider file (IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING 
 PROVIDER #355.93). If the NPI number is changed for a non-VA Provider, 
 new code in IB*2*391 checks to see whether there is a VA provider with 
 the old NPI. If so, IB sends a warning email message to the persons who 
 maintain the NPI for VA providers, so that they can keep the NPI numbers 
 in sync on the two files. The new IB code sends the warning email message 
 to all holders of the new key XUSNPIMTL.
  
  
 Modifications in this patch will allow users to continue to add/edit/delete
 National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) in the Provider ID Maintenance
 [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT] option.  However, the restriction in the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) does
 not allow a user to enter an NPI in the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER
 file (#355.93) if it already exists in the NEW PERSON file (#200) has been
 lifted with this patch.  This will allow a given provider's NPI to be ACTIVE
 in both of these files at the same time.
  
 This patch will match the NPI being input to the NEW PERSON file (#200) and
 the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file (#355.93). If the NPI being
 input is also an active NPI in the NEW PERSON file (#200) the user will be
 informed that a match was found in the NEW PERSON file (#200) and they
 will be asked if they wish to continue to associate the NPI to both the IB
 NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file (#355.93) and the NEW PERSON file
 (#200).
  
 If the NPI is found in the NEW PERSON file (#200) and the entry in the NEW
 PERSON file (#200) is found to be inactive the user will be informed that
 the NPI is inactive and the user will not be allowed to use that NPI.
  
 This patch will verify that the NPI being input by the user is not
 associated, now or in the past, with the INSTITUTION file (#4).  If the NPI
 being input by the user is associated, now or in the past, with the
 INSTITUTION file (#4) the user will not be allowed to use the NPI.
  
 All other NPI formatting and checksum requirements will remain the same.
 The NPI must be 10 numeric characters in length and have a proper checksum
 in the 10th position based on the Luhn double-add-double formula.

 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 HD 217536 Unable to add NPI number
 duplicate: HD 233251 Unable to add NPI number to Provider Maint File
 duplicate: HD 236989 NPI number won't go in for one provider
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD 217536 Unable to add NPI number
  
 Problem
 -------
 When the person putting in NPI numbers tries to put the number in for this
 provider, LAST,FIRST M the system comes back and says that number is already
 assigned to LAST,FIRST.
  
 It was discovered that the name LAST,FIRST M was in the NEW PERSON file
 (#200) and the name LAST,FIRST was in the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING
 PROVIDER file (#355.93).  The lookup of an NPI is done in the NEW PERSON
 file (#200),  the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file (#355.93) and the
 INSTITUTION file (#4).   An NPI was allowed to be in only one of these files.
 Situations were occurring where a provider was at one time a contractor
 and was carried in the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file (#355.93) and
 then became a VA employee and was put into the NEW PERSON file (#200).
 The NPI lookup allowed the NPI to exist in only one of these two files.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 The routines IBCEP8, IBCEP81 and IBCEP82 were modified to allow an NPI to
 exist in both the NEW PERSON file (#200) and the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING
 PROVIDER file (355.93) at the same time.  Along with allowing the NPI to be
 in both of these files at the same time the user is advised when making a
 change in one of the files and it is found that the NPI also exists in
 the other file at the same time.  This is done to insure that if the NPI
 is changed or deleted in one of the files it is also changed or deleted in
 the other file.
