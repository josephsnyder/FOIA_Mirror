Subject: 2010 RX COPAY THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Per forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2009-### (# to be assigned upon publication)
 - This patch MUST be installed before January 1, 2010. The patch is being
 released as an Emergency patch together with DG*5.3*818 (2010 Means Test
 Thresholds) and EAS*1.0*98 (2010 GMT Thresholds) and may be installed out
 of sequence with respect to other released Integrated Billing (IB)
 patches.
  
 Please Note:  We expect the VHA Directive to be titled MEANS TEST AND 
 GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2010. In order 
 to provide adequate time for sites to install, Central Business Office 
 has agreed that these patches may be released prior to availability of 
 the actual Directive Number.
  
 Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible 
 and for the pension threshold rates. These values need to be updated in 
 the associated Billing files for accurate and legal billing. The purpose 
 of this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension 
 Threshold rates and the Medicare Deductible value for Calendar Year 2010.
  
 A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values. The Technical 
 section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found 
 in forthcoming VHA Directive 2009-###. If a site has already entered the
 values manually, the record will be overwritten with the national update.
  
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2010 (with an effective date 
 of 12/1/09) are defined in forthcoming VHA Directive 2009-### as:
  
 *   $ 11,830 for a single veteran without dependents
 *   $ 15,493 for a veteran with 1 dependent
 *   An additional $ 2,020 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent
  
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2010 is shown as:
  
 *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,068.
  
 This patch, IB*2.0*425, is one of three VistA 2010 Threshold patches. It 
 addresses the annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds. Patch 
 DG*5.3*818 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum 
 Annual Pension Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*98 will address the annual updates for 
 the GMT Thresholds.
  
 Please Note:  This year, only the GMT Threshold dollar amounts will be 
 increasing from a year ago. All other dollar amounts and rates will 
 remain the same as the corresponding figures from last year. Patches for 
 the Registration and Integrated Billing packages are still needed in 
 order to link the figures to Calendar Year 2010/Income Year 2009.
