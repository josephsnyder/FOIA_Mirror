Subject: FIX IN THE PROCESSING OF MRA RETURN MESSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the issue regarding site not receiving the Medicare
 Remittance Advice (MRA) payments as noted on the Bill Status Report [IB 
 BILL STATUS REPORT]. This report is run daily or weekly to generate a
 summary of bill rate types and statuses. This patch will get the temporary
 messages "unstuck" from the Return Message Filing Exceptions [IBCE RETURN
 MSG PROCESSING] option.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000254378 Not Receiving MRAs
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Return Message Filing Exceptions [IBCE RETURN MSG PROCESSING] option
  doesn't process the EDI return messages properly and treats them as
  duplicates when their associated MailMan message numbers were used once
  and are used again for the EDI functionality.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine IBCESRV to retrieve the most recent EDI batch number 
  associated with the EDI claim batch instead of the oldest batch number.
  
  Also modified routines IBCEST and IBCEOB to remove the duplicate checker
  on the "AC" cross-xref in the BILL STATUS MESSAGE (#361) file and the 
  EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS (#361.1) file that caused the EDI return messages
  to get 'stuck' in the EDI MESSAGES (#364.2) file and not be processed
  further.
  
  Created a post-init routine (IB20P407) to process the EDI return
  messages that are already 'stuck' in the EDI MESSAGES (#364.2) file 
  and are currently showing up in the Return Message Filing Exceptions
  [IBCE RETURN MSG PROCESSING] option. This routine will file messages
  dated from the install date of this patch going back one year and also
  delete messages older than one year as long as the associated bill has
  been collected/closed or cancelled in AR from the temporary file EDI
  MESSAGES (#364.2) when a background job is complete. Two Mailman messages
  will be generated with the installation of the patch and both 
  will go to the installer. One will contain a list of Return Messages 
  Filed by the post-init routine, and the other a list of those Deleted by
  the post-init routine. Those records will no longer appear in the option.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 It is recommended that this patch be installed outside of normal business
 hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.
 The installation time will depend on the size of the global in
 the database, but will probably take less than 10 minutes.
