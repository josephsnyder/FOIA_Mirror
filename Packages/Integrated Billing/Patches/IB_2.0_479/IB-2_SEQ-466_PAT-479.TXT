Subject: SITE PARAMETER DISPLAYS INCORRECTLY FOR IV SECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues: 
  
 1. The extract name which displays incorrectly for IV section in the MCCR 
    Site Parameter Display/Edit option.
  
 2. A '^' character is causing duplicate CPT codes (in the thousands) on 
    Inpatient bills in the Enter/Edit Billing Information option.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000359215 Site Parameter displays incorrectly for IV section
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When the batch extract parameters are displayed in the [IBJ MCCR SITE
  PARAMETERS] option, the extract names don't belong to their associated
  selection criteria on the same line.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine IBJPI was modified to pass the internal number of the extract
  name instead of the external value to FILEMAN DIQ call and return the
  appropriate extract name to display in the option.
  
 2. INC000000407527 CPT codes on Inpt bills (many) duplicated 1000's of times
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site user received the CPT duplicates in thousands on an inpatient bill
  in the IB option. The internal number of the secondary diagnosis code
  associated with the procedure is incorrectly used as the quantity to
  duplicate the CPT code on the bill.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routines IBCSC4A, IBCSC4B and IBCSC4E were modified to omit the '^' 
  character associated with ASCII value of 94 as a grouping letter in the
  scratch global file. It caused the subsequent '^' pieces of the CPT data
  to shift one position for adding procedures.
