Associated patches: (v)IB*2*416    <<= must be installed BEFORE `IB*2*444'

Subject: MODIFICATION TO E-IV AUTO-FILING LOGIC

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains the fix for the following issue:
  
 Currently, if a payer responds with acknowledgement status 'AA' in field 1
 of MSA segment and the response includes past expiration date, the
 response is considered to be a positive response by VistA and is eligible
 for automatic update. Therefore, a user cannot determine if the policy in
 question has expired because the expiration date is not auto-updated by
 the software.
  
 This patch adds an extra check for determination of response being
 positive or negative - if Eligibility/Benefit status in field 2 of ZEB
 segment is not set to 1 ("Active Coverage"), the response is now
 considered to be negative regardless of the acknowledgement value in MSA
 segment.
