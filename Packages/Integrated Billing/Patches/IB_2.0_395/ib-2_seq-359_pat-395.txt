Subject: PHARMACY NPI FIX (REPLACES IB*2*388)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch replaces the entered in error patch IB*2*388.  IB*2*388 was 
 entered in error as a result of conflicting routines with IB*2*371.  
 Install of this patch will not only install the IB*3*388 functionality, 
 but will make sure the any functionality that may have been lost from 
 IB*2*371 is also restored.
  
  
 The issue being addressed is with printed prescription 3rd party claims.
 On the new UB-04 and CMS-1500 claim forms the facility's main NPI number
 was appearing on the printed bills instead of the Facility Pharmacy NPI
 number.  All facilities have been previously issued Pharmacy NPI numbers 
 with a Kernel patch in their respective institution files.  Assuming the 
 pharmacy site parameters in the Outpatient Site (#59), NPI INSTITUTION 
 (#101) field are setup to the site's pharmacy institution, printed bills 
 should print the appropriate pharmacy NPI on both the UB-04 and CMS-1500 
 claim forms.
  
 Since only one institutional NPI can be printed on a claim form an
 additional edit/check in the bill authorization process will be made to
 warn users if a bill contains prescriptions with multiple pharmacy NPI
 institutions.
  
 To further assist billing staff in resolving these multiple pharmacy NPI
 institutions, a new '?RX' feature will be available in option Enter/Edit
 Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] that will display pharmacy
 related data that is on a bill.  '?ID' was also updated to display the
 Pharmacy institution name and NPI if available.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD 205121 Insurance Companies rejecting claims due to NPI
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a printed claim form is printed there was never a consideration 
    to utilize the prescription's related Pharmacy NPI number on either the
    UB-04 or CMS-1500.  This resulted in claims being denied and the site
    having to change the NPI number on the form prior to mailing.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBCEF73A to utilize the Prescription's Pharmacy NPI 
    number on either claim form if the bill is for prescription related 
    items.  The routine will look up the Outpatient Site from the
    Prescription (#52) file, DIVISION (#20 or #8 on refills) field.  Look
    up the Institution from the Outpatient Site (#59) file, NPI Institution
    (#101) field, and the NPI number to utilize from the Institution (#4)
    file.
    
    Also FORMAT CODE (#101) filed in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7)
    file for the SERVICE FAC NPI (BX-32A) is being updated by IB20P395 to
    utilize the Pharmacy NPI.
  
 1. HD 231553 Patch IB*2*371 and IB*2*388 conflict
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There were 3 conflicting routines between IB*2*388 and IB*2*371.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The install of this patch will install the full IB*2*388 functionality 
    including the 3 routines that conflicted with IB*2*371, maintaining the
    IB*2*371 functionality.
  
  
 These changes will effect the following Output Formatter fields:
    UB-04, BILLING PROVIDER NPI (FL-56)
    CMS-1500, SERVICE FAC NPI (BX-32A)
    CMS-1500, BILLING PROVIDER NPI (BX-33A)
  
  
  
 Since the claim forms do not allow for multiple NPI numbers for 
 prescription claims, a new edit check is included at completion of a 
 Bill.  The following new warning message will be displayed indicating the 
 number of associated NPI numbers that were found on the associated 
 prescriptions:
  
    Bill has prescriptions resulting from 2 different NPI locations
  
  
  
 To further assist billing staff in resolving multiple NPIs on a 
 prescription bill a new ?RX function is included within the billing 
 option Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] to display 
 pharmacy related data:

        ================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==================
    
 It is recommended that this patch be installed outside of normal working 
 hours when no Integrated Billing users are on the system. However, if
 installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the following
 selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
    
      Enter/Edit Billing Information       [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
      Print Bill                           [IB PRINT BILL]
      Print Authorized Bills               [IB BATCH PRINT BILLS]
      View/Print EDI Bill Extract Data     [IBCE EDI VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT]
      Provider ID Maintenance              [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT] 
         
   **** Do not install this patch when the IB MT NIGHT COMP background job
        is running.
    
  
 Also, make sure that electronic claims are NOT scheduled to be 
 transmitted via TaskManager while the patch is being installed. It's best 
 to check with your Billing section. There is a field called HOURS TO 
 TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) that may 
 contain specific times to transmit bills.
    
 Any future tasks set up in TaskManager based on the HOURS TO TRANSMIT 
 BILLS (#8.06) field in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) would appear 
 similar to this:
  
    
    5310003: FORMOUT^IBCEFG7, OUTPUT FORMATTER - FORM: IB 837 TRANSMISSION.
             No device.  ACT,ACT.  From Today at 1:01,  By you.
             Scheduled for Today at 16:00
    
 If there are no specific times set up in this parameter, claims will be
 transmitted when the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT
 COMP] job runs.
   
   
      Install time - less than 2 minutes.

 Post-install Note
 -----------------
 The install of IB*2*395 updates the national UB-04 and CMS-1500 claim 
 form.  Sites may have a local override on the fields being updated.  The 
 local overrides will not be deleted with the install and will not directly
 be updated.  But depending on how sites have implemented their local
 overrides, they may or may not change.  Sites should review any local
 overrides on the following fields to make sure they print the NPI desired:
  
    UB-04, BILLING PROVIDER NPI (FL-56)
    CMS-1500, SERVICE FAC NPI (BX-32A)
    CMS-1500, BILLING PROVIDER NPI (BX-33A)
