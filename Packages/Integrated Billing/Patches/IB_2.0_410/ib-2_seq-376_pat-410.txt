Subject: 2009 RX COPAY THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NOTE: The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) will install patch IVMB*2.0*938 
 (2009 MT/GMT/RX Thresholds) before January 1, 2009.
  
 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2008-083 - This patch MUST be installed before January 
 1, 2009. The patch is being released as an emergency patch together with 
 DG*5.3*798 (2009 Means Test Thresholds) and EAS*1.0*89 (2009 GMT 
 Thresholds) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to other 
 released IB patches.
  
 Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible 
 and for the pension threshold rates. These values need to be updated in 
 the associated billing files for accurate and legal billing.  The purpose 
 of this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension 
 Threshold rates and the Medicare Deductible value for Calendar Year 2009.
  
 A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values.  The Technical 
 section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found 
 in VHA Directive 2008-083. If a site has already entered the values 
 manually, the record will be overwritten with the national update.
  
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2009 (with an effective date 
 of 12/1/08) are defined in VHA Directive 2008-083, dated December 16, 
 2008 as:
  
 *   $ 11,830 for a single veteran without dependents
 *   $ 15,493 for a veteran with 1 dependent
 *   An additional $ 2,020 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent
  
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2009 is shown as:
  
 *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,068.
  
 This patch, IB*2.0*410 is one of three VistA 2009 threshold patches. It 
 addresses the annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds. Patch 
 DG*5.3*798 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum 
 Annual Pension Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*89 will address the annual updates for 
 the GMT Thresholds.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 The components sent with this patch IB*2.0*410 have been included in the 
 HOST File DG_53_P798.KID.  Please follow the instructions listed in the 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section of the patch description for patch 
 DG*5.3*798.  NOTE:  during the installation, please bear in mind items 1 
 and 2 below.
  
  
   1.   During installation, the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be
        checked for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
        thresholds. If there are some, the installer will be prompted to
        UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status
        may change due to the new rates.
  
        Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print.
        At the DEVICE prompt you must enter a print device. An entry is
        required and the HOME device is not allowed, neither is the
        p-Message device (this will abort the install). You MUST choose a
        valid printer. You need not queue the report since the patch will
        do so automatically.
