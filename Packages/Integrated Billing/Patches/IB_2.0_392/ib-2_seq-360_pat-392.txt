Subject: NPI - MODIFY MISSING TAXONOMY FATAL EDIT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Modifications in this patch will allow users to continue to send out 
 claims without taxonomies for type 1 (individual) and type 2 (organizational)
 providers where the taxonomies are not sent in the 837 transmission from
 the Financial Services Center (FSC) in Austin to the clearinghouse. There
 is currently code in Vista that will change the warnings that users receive
 when taxonomies are missing to fatal edits for all providers effective 
 05/23/2008, and hence prevent the claims from being submitted.  This 
 patch will produce fatal edits when the Attending, Rendering or Referring 
 Provider taxonomies are missing on or after 5/23/2008.  It will produce 
 non-fatal warnings when Other, Operating, Supervising, Billing Provider, 
 Purchased Service or Lab/Facility taxonomies are missing.
