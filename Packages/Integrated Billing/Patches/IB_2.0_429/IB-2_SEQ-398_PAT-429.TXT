 This patch enhances the Integrated Billing Outpatient Medication 
 Copayment software to support different copayment rates based on the 
 patient's priority group.  Currently all patients are charged the same 
 rate ($8.00) regardless of priority group.  As requested by the Chief 
 Business Office (CBO), IB will support an additional amount for patients 
 with Priority Groups 7 and 8 of $1.00.  With the install of this patch 
 patients with Priority Group 7 or 8 will be charged $9.00 per 30 days 
 supply of Outpatient Medications effective July 1, 2010.  All other 
 patients will continue to be charged $8.00 per 30 days supply of 
 Outpatient Medications.  Any Outpatient Medication Charges entered on or 
 after July 1, 2010 will utilize the new rate structure.  No manual 
 intervention of copayment rates or charges will be necessary.  There is 
 also no change to the Outpatient Medication Copayment cap since the cap 
 does not apply to Priority Groups 7 and 8.
