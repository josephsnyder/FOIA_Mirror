Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.
  
 This patch is being released along with PSO*7*303 and PSS*1*139.  These 
 patches can be installed in any order but the full functionality 
 contained within these patches will not be available until all 3 patches 
 are installed.
  
  
 This patch modifies the Integrated Billing v2.0 application as described 
 below:
  
 1.  Previously patch IB*2*383 was released creating the framework for 
 ePharmacy billing of Tricare patients, but the functionality was 
 blocked.  The install of this patch removes the block.  Tricare ePharmacy
 billing will be dependent on the release of a Tricare payer sheet from the
 CBO.  Once CBO releases nationally a payer sheet sites can link up the
 payer sheet to a group insurance plan and activate it locally for
 ePharmacy billing.  Sites should ensure they are an approved site for
 Tricare billing prior to activation.  All sites will be able to utilize
 the same functionally for Active Duty related ePharmacy billing.
  
 2.  With the release of the pharmacy related patches, pharmacy will allow 
 sites to specify an 'N' in the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field of the DRUG 
 (#50) file for Nutritional Supplement.  With the implementation of the 
 'N' in the DEA Special Handling field, IB will consider all drugs with an 
 'N' as non-billable unless the DEA Special Handling field also contains 
 an 'E' to indicate 3rd party billable.  This will apply to both ePharmacy 
 and paper claims.
  
 3.  In an attempt to provide the most current fill date across IB, the 
 Fill Date in Claims Tracking is updated whenever the Fill Date is changed 
 as a result of a change in ePharmacy by a check for a billable claim or 
 an attempt to create a bill.
  
 4.  As an enhancement to data storage within IB, the fill number for all 
 future prescription bills will be stored in the IB BILL/CLAIMS 
 PRESCRIPTION REFILL (#362.4) file, FILL NUMBER (#.1) field.  A post-
 install will run to attempt to populate this new field when possible.
