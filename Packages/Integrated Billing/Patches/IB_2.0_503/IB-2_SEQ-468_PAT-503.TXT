    Feasor, Workers Compensation, Humanitarian, Ineligible, Tricare and
    Tricare Reimbursable Insurance on third party pharmacy prescription
    claims.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000923431 CY2014 Administrative Fee Update for 3rd Party RX Claims
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Chief Business Office (CBO) has requested an update to the
  administrative charge for third party pharmacy prescription with an
  effective date of January 1st, 2014. The administrative charge for
  Tricare Reimbursable Insurance and Tricare is $11.56 and the charge for
  the others is $13.07.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A post-init routine IB20P503 was created to call a procedure to inactivate
  rate schedules containing the RX COST charge set for those rate types with
  an inactive date of December 31, 2013. It also updates the adjustments for
  those rate types with the new dispensing fee effective from January 1st,
  2014 in the Rate Schedule (#363) file.
  
 2. INC000000835774 LINE NUMBER AND DATE RUN TOGETHER
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The line item number and the Bill From date fields run together in the 
  Cancel/Edit/Add Patient Charges [IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES] option if a
  patient has more than 99 charges.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  List template IB CHARGES was modified to display one more space
  between the line item number and the Bill From date for the patient's
  charges within option [IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES].
