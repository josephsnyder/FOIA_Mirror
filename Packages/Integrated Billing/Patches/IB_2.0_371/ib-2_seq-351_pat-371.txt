Description:
============

 The eClaims Plus project was divided into multiple iterations.
  
 This patch is primarily focused on reducing the number of electronic claim
 rejections by enhancing the Integrated Billing (IB) edit checks that
 happen before the claim is authorized. It also includes enhancements to
 the way in which Patient Insurance is entered and updated. The electronic
 claim Electronic Data Interface (EDI) data produced by the output
 formatter also had significant changes.
  
 Full list of patch items:
  
 1.  Forty new IB error messages have been added to the IB ERROR file
     (#350.8). These error messages are displayed to the biller whenever
     the claim fails these IB edit checks. A claim must pass all IB edit
     checks before it can be authorized.
  
 2.  Changes have been made to the entry and update of the patient's
     insurance information. This is stored in the INSURANCE TYPE multiple
     (#2.312) of the PATIENT file (#2). The patient's primary ID number
     field was added when the patient and the subscriber are different and 
     the insurance company assigns unique ID numbers for the subscriber 
     and all dependents. A corresponding field has also been added to the
     INSURANCE BUFFER file (#355.33).
  
 3.  The name of the insured person is now able to be edited even when the
     patient and the subscriber are the same. When the patient is the 
     subscriber, several of the patient insurance fields (like the name) 
     will be provided as default values from the patient file, but they 
     may be overridden.
  
 4.  Support has been added for the data entry of up to 3 secondary ID's 
     and qualifiers for both the patient and for the insurance subscriber.
  
 5.  The insurance company editor option has been changed to allow for the 
     storage of additional payer ID's and qualifiers. Also, payer address 
     line 1 and line 2 may no longer be the same thing.
  
 6.  For MRA request claims which are split by Medicare, VistA receives 2 
     or more MRAs. The MRA secondary claim will now include all of the
     MRAs on file for these claims even when the MRA is denied with $0 of
     patient responsibility.
  
 7.  For CMS-1500 claims, $0 line items are ignored by EDI. However, MRA 
     secondary claims are not constructed properly when the claim has a $0 
     line item. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 8.  EDI support for chiropractic claims has been added by this patch.
  
 9.  FL-8a, FL-14, and FL-59 A:C on the UB-04 claim form have been changed
     by this patch. The patient ID number will now print in FL-8a when the
     patient is different than the subscriber. For outpatient claims, 
     FL-14, Type of Admission, will now default to the value of "9". The
     Patient Relationship to the Insured codes that print in FL-59 A:C have
     been updated. They are now the HIPAA X12 codes instead of the internal
     VistA codes.
  
 10. Box 20 on the CMS-1500 claim form has been changed by this patch.  
     OUTSIDE LAB? will be marked YES if the service facility is a Non-VA 
     facility. Otherwise, OUTSIDE LAB? will be marked NO. The dollar 
     amount on the left side of the $CHARGES field will be the total 
     purchased service charges amount. The right side of the $CHARGES 
     field will always be blank.
  
 11. The Help Text and data entry checks have been enhanced for Value Code
     values and Occurrence Span dates. An error message has been added to
     prevent the transmission of a Value Code with no associated value.  
     Value Codes that were made obsolete on 3/1/07 were made unavailable to
     billers for claims after 3/1/07.
  
 12. The Bill Remarks text will be electronically transmitted for UB-04 
     claims. This is the text that is locally printed in FL-80.
  
 13. FL-14 will default to a 9 if not present on UB-04. 
  
 14. The print status of the printed UB-04 claim will now be displayed in
     FL-38 above the payer name and address. The available print statuses
     are "*** SECOND NOTICE ***", "*** THIRD NOTICE ***", "*** COPY OF 
     ORIGINAL BILL ***", and "*** NOT A BILL-MRA NEEDED ***". 
  
 15. Claims may not be electronically transmitted to Austin if they have 
     three payers on the claim and the current payer sequence of the claim 
     is either secondary or tertiary.
  
 16. The ability to transmit UB-04 MRA request replacement claims was
     added. The Medicare ICN/DCN and claim remarks must both be present 
     on the claim.
  
 17. The "*" review in process indicator was added to the CSA print report 
     option.
  
 18. The Creation Date field on the printed UB-04 claim form was changed 
     so that it will show the date the claim was first printed. So when 
     claims are reprinted, this creation date field will not change.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Tickets:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD64676   FGH-0105-30816  Billing vets and Tri Care
 2. HD64841   WPB-0205-30321  COB has wrong payment
 3. HD174382  Need to enter 10 characters in VALUE field 399.047,.02
 4. HD64505   BAY-1204-30722  SYNTAX ERROR PT1-07 MISSING
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ---------------------------
 1. HD64676  FGH-0105-30816  Billing vets and Tri Care
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the Rate Type for the claim is Interagency or Sharing Agreement, the
 payer sequence error message improperly appears at the end of the 
 Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option. There should
 be no coordination of benefits required for these types of claims.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine IBCBB1 to eliminate the payer sequence error message in
 the edit checks for Interagency and Sharing Agreement claims.
  
  
 2. HD64841  WPB-0205-30321  COB has wrong payment
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the option Copy for Secondary/Tertiary Bill [IB COPY
 SECOND/THIRD] to create a secondary or tertiary bill, the prior payment
 amount extracted from the original bill didn't reflect the true payment
 that resulted in the bill total to be incorrect.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine IBCEU1 to default the prior payment amount by using the
 Payer Paid Amt field instead of the Patient Responsible Amt field in the
 EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS (#361.1) file.
  
  
 3. HD174382  Need to enter 10 characters in VALUE field 399.047,.02
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The current VistA software only allows 9 characters for the value code 
 value amounts. In terms of dollars and cents, this will allow a maximum
 value code dollar amount of 999999.99 which includes the decimal point.  
 Some sites have claims larger than $1 million dollars so this field is 
 too small.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Increase the size of this field to allow for the data entry of 10 
 characters. This will allow for a maximum value code dollar amount of 
 9999999.99. This is the maximum allowed by the VA's electronic claim 
 clearinghouse Emdeon and also the maximum allowed by HIPAA.
  
  
 4. HD64505   BAY-1204-30722  SYNTAX ERROR PT1-07 MISSING
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Electronic claims get rejected at Emdeon when the patient or subscriber
 street address is missing or incomplete.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch provides many more IB edit checks so that claims may not be 
 transmitted if they have incorrect or incomplete addresses.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Both the pre-installation routine and the post-installation routine
 are automatically deleted after this patch is installed.
  
 The pre-installation routine removes output formatter entries that are 
 included in this patch so they are installed cleanly. It also removes a 
 trigger cross reference which was originally in this patch but was later 
 replaced with a new style cross reference. Since the trigger cross
 reference had been created at the test site, it needed to be deleted.  
 This will have no effect on sites that did not install the earlier 
 versions of this patch.
  
 The post-installation routine recompiles the input templates associated 
 with IB billing screens 3 through 7. It also examines all of the 
 addresses in the INSURANCE COMPANY (#36) file, and removes any duplicate 
 address lines that it finds. It also populates the secondary payer ID 
 for the MEDICARE (WNR) insurance company entry. It adds some help text and
 the obsolete date field to the value codes. Finally, it adds a new style 
 cross reference to sub-field VALUE CODE (#399.047) which makes sure the
 VALUE (#.02) field is in the correct format when a VALUE CODE (#.01) is
 modified.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 It is recommended that this patch be installed outside of normal working
 hours when no Integrated Billing users are on the system. However, if
 installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the following
 selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
       Patient Insurance Info View/Edit     [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
       Insurance Company Entry/Edit         [DG INSURANCE COMPANY EDIT]
       Insurance Company Entry/Edit         [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT]
       Process Insurance Buffer             [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS]
       Enter/Edit Billing Information       [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
       Print Bill                           [IB PRINT BILL]
       Print Authorized Bills               [IB BATCH PRINT BILLS]
       View/Print EDI Bill Extract Data     [IBCE EDI VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT]
  
 **** Do not install this patch when the IB MT NIGHT COMP background job
      is running.
  
 Also, make sure that electronic claims are NOT scheduled to be transmitted
 via TaskManager while the patch is being installed. It's best to check
 with your Billing section on this. There is a field called HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) that may
 contain specific times to transmit bills.
  
 Any future tasks set up in TaskManager based on the field HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) field in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) would
 appear similar to this:
  
  5310003: FORMOUT^IBCEFG7, OUTPUT FORMATTER - FORM: IB 837 TRANSMISSION.
           No device.  ACT,ACT.  From Today at 1:01,  By you.
           Scheduled for Today at 16:00
  
 If there are no specific times set up in this parameter, claims will be
 transmitted when the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT
 COMP] job runs.
  
  
 Install Time - It can vary between 5 minutes and 30 minutes. The most 
                time consuming part of this install is STEP 5 of the 
                post-install routine which builds a new style cross-
                reference in the VALUE CODE multiple (399.047) of the
                BILL/CLAIMS file (399).
