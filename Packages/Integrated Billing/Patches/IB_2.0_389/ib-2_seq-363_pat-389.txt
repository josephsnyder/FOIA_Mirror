Description:
============

 This patch updates the use of Prosthetics data within billing.  It is 
 primarily a maintenance patch with few functional changes.
                                      
 The Prosthetics Package has changed the Item description displayed to 
 users from the Pros Item Master Name to the Prosthetic HCPCS Short 
 Description.  This patch changes Integrated Billing from using the Pros 
 Item Master Name to the Prosthetic HCPCS Short Description, thereby 
 updating Integrated Billing to be consistent with the Prosthetics Package.
                                             
 The following are the list of changes.
                                       
 Third Party Billing:
 --------------------
 The record created for Prosthetics Items added to a bill included the link 
 to the Item through the Pros Item Master, which is no longer valid.  This 
 link has been removed and replaced by a free text Prosthetic Item Name 
 which will be filled when the Item is added to the bill:
 -  The Prosthetics Item Name assigned to Items on existing bills will be 
    the Pros Item Master Name when the patch is installed.  This will allow 
    retention of the Item names used when the bill was originally processed.
 -  The Prosthetics Item Name assigned to Items added to bills after this 
    patch will be identified by the Prosthetic HCPCS Short Description.  
                                       
 In option Enter/Edit Billing Information, when a Prosthetics Item is added 
 to a bill the Prosthetic HCPCS Short Description will be added to the 
 billing record of the item.  The selection of Prosthetics Items will be 
 changed to Prosthetic HCPCS Short Description.
                                      
 In option Enter/Edit Billing Information, the display of items from 
 Prosthetics will display the Prosthetic HCPCS Short Description.
                                       
 In option Enter/Edit Billing Information, all displays of Items on the 
 bill will be updated to display the description of the item when it was 
 added to the bill.
                                      
 Special note, historical records will be identified with the Item Name of 
 the Item at the time it was added to the bill.

 Third Party Bill Print/Output:
 ------------------------------
 In all cases where the Item Description is printed the description will be 
 the description at the time the item was added to the bill.

 Transfer Pricing:
 -----------------
 In Transfer Pricing the transaction of a Prosthetics Item included a link 
 to the Item through the Pros Item Master, which is no longer valid.  This 
 link has been removed and replaced with the Prosthetic HCPCS Short 
 Description of the Prosthetics HCPCS code assigned to the Patient 
 Prosthetics record.
                                       
 In all cases where the Item Description is displayed/printed the 
 description will be the Prosthetic HCPCS Short Description instead of the 
 Pros Item Master Name
                                       
 Also, Prosthetics Items are generally not included in Transfer Pricing if 
 for Inpatient Care.  However it is possible to identify certain Items that 
 should be included for inpatient care.  This has been changed so the Items 
 to include are identified by Prosthetics HCPCS rather than Pros Item 
 Master Name.

 HD063305 - BOI-0502-53087  Bill not showing all prosthetics items
    Bill was not showing all Prosthetics Items if the same Item was 
    delivered on the same date.  This was due to the array of items being 
    ordered by Item number.  Corrected by changing the array.  Now if the 
    same Item is delivered on the same date then both will show on the 
    display list and will be selectable for addition to the bill.

 HD181915 - IB MT NIGHT COMP stopped by error (AO+5^SDCO22)
 HD215931 - IB MT NIGHT COMP ERROR (AO+5~SDCO22)
    These two tickets are duplicates.  The nightly task that adds 
    Prosthetics Items to Claims Tracking errors out if the Prosthetic Item 
    entry is missing the Patient (DFN).  This has been corrected, if the 
    Item's Patient is not identified then the nightly task will not try to 
    add that item to Claims Tracking.  (IBTRKR5)

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
                                      
 The Pre-Installation deletes the DD fields modified by this patch, they 
 are re-added by the installation.  This is to ensure proper clean-up of 
 the Data Dictionary:
 1.  TRANSFER PRICING TRANSACTIONS file, PROSTHETIC ITEM     (#351.61,4.04)
 2.  TRANSFER PRICING INPT PROSTHETIC ITEMS file, ITEM field (#351.67,.01)
 3.  IB BILL/CLAIMS PROSTHETICS file, ITEM field             (#362.5,.03)
                                    
                                    
 The Post-Installation performs two actions:
                                      
 1.  All entries are deleted from the TRANSFER PRICING INPT PROSTHETIC ITEMS 
     file (#351.67).  This file pointed directly to PROS ITEM MASTER (#661) 
     file, which is now out of date.  Therefore it will be changed to point 
     to the PROSTHETIC HCPCS (#661.1) file.  There is no direct link 
     between the #661 and #661.1 files so a conversion is not possible.  
     Therefore if this file has any entries they need to be re-created 
     after the patch installation.  
                                      
 2.  The current Pros Item Master Name (#661) is added as Free Text to 
     every existing IB BILL/CLAIMS PROSTHETICS (362.5) file entry.  This is 
     to ensure that the name of the Item at the time it was billed is 
     available for historical purposes.

 This patch will add a free text field to the IB BILL/CLAIMS PROSTHETICS 
 file (#362.5,.05) and the post-init will fill that field for existing 
 entries.  It is estimated that this will require less than .5Mb per 1000 
 entries in the file.  The number of entries in this file varies widely 
 from site to site, from 0 to 34,000.

 Using VA FileMan option 'PRINT FILE ENTRIES', Print the .01 field, ITEM, 
 for all entries in the TRANSFER PRICING INPT PROSTHETIC ITEMS (#351.67) 
 file.  Keep a copy of this report so these entries can be re-created/re-
 entered in the same file after the patch installation using the 
 instructions in the post-installation section.  The majority of sites will 
 have a small number of entries if any at all.
                                      
 File Growth in ^IBA(362.5, - Check the number of entries in the IB

 entries.
