 NUMBER (IEN) for the user is now an eleven digit number.  This 11 digit 
 number creates an "Invalid Integer" error when the user attempts to login 
 using the GUI application. All previous users in this file are able to 
 login without error.

 Problem:  
 --------
 A site reported that in the NEW PERSON FILE (#200), the INTERNAL ENTRY

 The RMIMFIM Context version entry in OPTION FILE (#19) will be updated to

 this patch. The installation of this patch will perform the update and
