Subject: PCMM PHASE III - INACTIVATION OF PROVIDERS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Print Template

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the current behavior of PCMM (Patient Care Management
 Module) with regards to provider inactivation, PCMM HL7 message type A08
 errors: 001M, 104M, 113M, and a patient inactivation issue associated with
 reactivating a previously auto inactivated patient.
  
 Patch SD*5.3*297 introduced provider inactivation as a one time event to 
 be initiated six months after installation of the patch.  This patch will
 provide functionality for a monthly inactivation of providers whose Person
 Class is inappropriate for their role.  Providers are first marked for
 inactivation and the scheduled inactivation is listed in the email 
 bulletin "PC Providers Scheduled for Inactivation."  The provider marked
 for inactivation does not receive this email; instead, the bulletin is
 directed to the mail group PCMM PATIENT/PROVIDER INACTIVE.  The PCMM menu 
 option "Staff Sched for Inactivation" [SCMC PRACTITIONER FLAGGED] provides
 an on demand listing of providers marked for inactivation.
  
 Once a provider has been identified and marked for inactivation, the 
 responsible party will have a grace period of at least 30 days to correct 
 the Person Class issue.  If the Person Class issue remains uncorrected 
 after 30 days, the provider will be inactivated from the Team Position on 
 the next end of month processing event.
  
 To address Remedy ticket 212756, the PCMM HL7 transmission routines have 
 been updated to correct logic introduced in patch SD*5.3*515 that 
 resulted in segments being dropped from the PCMM A08 HL7 message
 payload.  Dropped message segments resulted in error types:
 001M - ENV segment missing
 104M - Event Date missing or out of range.
 113M - Event Type is not 'A08'
  
 Remedy ticket #248638 identified an issue with patients who were 
 automatically inactivated and subsequently reactivated.  These patients 
 were not flagged for future inactivation because the date of reactivation 
 was recorded in field #.17 (DATE DISINACTIVATED) of the Patient Team 
 Position Assignment file (#404.43).  A value in this field caused the 
 tasked job, PCMM NIGHTLY TASK [SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK], to not evaluate
 the patient for future inactivations.  The use of this field to evaluate
 inactivations has been discontinued.

 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 =============================
  
 1.  HD248638     PCMM:  Patient Reactivation
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the DATE DISINACTIVATED field (#.17), of an entry in the
 PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT file (#404.43) has a value entered
 (the patient was reactivated after being auto inactivated) the
 PCMM NIGHTLY TASK [SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK] job fails to evaluate the
 reactivated entry for any possible future automatic inactivation.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This field is no longer used and the condition is eliminated. Patients
 that have been reactivated will now be evaluated for any possible future
 automatic inactivation.

                  HD279240  Misc. Errors in PCMM
 Problem:
 --------
 The PCMM Transmission Error Processing [SCMC PCMM TRANS ERROR PROC] report
 displays errors of type 113M, 104M, and 001M.  Patient name associated
 with the error is listed as "Unknown."  These types of errors are the
 result the PCMM HL7 A08 type messages missing the EVN and PID segments.  
 These "missing segment" messages were the result of incorrect program
 logic which caused the message creation process to delete the EVN and PID
 segments under certain circumstances.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 In routine SCMCHLB, the code was modified to set the variables correctly, 
 resulting in correct execution of the branching code logic.

 3.  HD170675     SD*5.3*297 and inactive providers
  
 Problem:
 --------
 SD*5.3*297 introduced the inactivation of providers with inactive Person
 Class assignments.  A one time inactivation of these providers occurred
 six months after the installation of the patch.  It was requested this
 functionality be modified to perform a monthly inactivation of providers
 with inactive Person Class assignments.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 The PCMM NIGHTLY TASK [SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK] will now identify providers
 with inactive person class assignments.  Notification of providers to be
 inactivated is provided by bulletin "PC Providers Scheduled for
 Inactivation." An on demand option is also available, "Staff Sched for
 Inactivation" [SCMC PRACTITIONER FLAGGED], from the "PROVIDER/POSITION
 REPORTS AND OPTIONS" [SCMC PCMM PROVIDER RPTS MENU] of the PCMM Menu.
