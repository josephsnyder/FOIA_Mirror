Description: 
============

  
 *****************************  NOTE  ************************************
  
   Due to the national interest in VAMC capacity to care for veterans this 
   patch has a shortened installation compliance date. Installing this
   patch as soon as possible is necessary to transmit workload data which 
   will facilitate national care capacity analysis.
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 Transmission of Provider Workload to AAC
  
 This patch will provide for transmission of provider workload to AAC.
 Entering and editing PRIMARY CARE FTEE EQUIVALENT data in PCMM will 
 trigger the HL7 event. The message is generated at the same time
 current PCMM HL7 messaging is run. This is usually a nightly scheduled
 task PCMM HL7 Transmission [SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT].
  
 A post installation routine will review existing active providers with 
 FTEE workload information and trigger those records for transmission.
  
 A pre installation routine will set up a new code 'B02' in the 
 HL7 event file(# 779.001)
  
 CODE: B02                          DESCRIPTION: PCMM Workload Transmission
 VERSION: 2.4
  
 It will also set a PMU entry in the HL7 MESSAGE TYPE file (#771.2)
 ABBREVIATED NAME: PMU                   FULL NAME: Workload Message
 VERSION: 2.4
  
 Protocols Transported
  
 SCMC LE DESELECT PATIENT   Select Record(s) for Retransmit
 SCMC LE RETRANSMIT PATIENT Deselect Record(s) for Retransmit 
  
    These protocols are utilized in PCMM Transmission Error Processing and
    have been renamed for enhanced capability of handling new HL7
    transmissions which are not Patient centric.
        
 SCMC SEND CLIENT WORKLOAD   PCMM SEND CLIENT FOR WORKLOAD

 Mailgroup
  
 A new mailgroup is transported in this package PCMM WORKLOAD FTEE MAIL 
 GROUP. It requires that XXX@Q-NPD.MED.VA.GOV be included as a remote 
 member to receive HL7 messages.
 Local users may be added to this group, if they wish to receive and 
 monitor the messages.

 HL LOGICAL LINK (#870)
  
   PCMM WORK is transported to transmit HL7 messages to AAC.
   NODE: PCMM WORK                         LLP TYPE: MAILMAN
   DEVICE TYPE: MailMan                  STATE: IDLE

   Sites will need to insure that this HL LOGICAL LINK is started using the
   Start/Stop Links option in the HL7 MAIN MENU.
  
  
 The DOMAIN Q-NPD.MED.VA.GOV is required for this patch
  
 NAME: Q-NPD.MED.VA.GOV
 If this domain is not on your system follow instructions in Mailman patch
 XM*DBA*151 to enter this Domain.
  
 Transmission for a provider with multiple team position assignments in the
 same facility will be combined, with values added into a single message.
 Currently there is not a check in VistA to insure that total FTEE for a 
 provider at multiple positions does not exceed 1.0. Messages sent with 
 FTEE levels exceeding 1.0 will generate a 702M error that can be seen in 
 the PCMM Transmission Error Processing option. When the FTEE level is 
 corrected a new message will be transmitted.

      option will load the KIDS package onto your system and will take 
      less than 5 minutes.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time
  
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your system.
      You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global. On the KIDS
      menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
  
          Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
          Select INSTALL NAME: SD*5.3*272
                               ==========
  5. If you are installing for the first time you will be prompted.
  
     Incoming Mail Groups:
  
     Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'PCMM WORKLOAD FTEE MAIL GROUP':
  
     Enter a user who will coordinate the staff that will be reviewing PCMM
     workload messages.
  
  6. Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
  
  7. Do NOT inhibit users from login into the system.
  
  8.  Answer 'YES' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols?
         
      Disable the following options during installation
           
    SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT        PCMM HL7 Transmission
    SCMC PATIENT ASSIGN/UNASSIGN  Primary Care Team/Posn Assign or Unassign
    SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION     PCMM GUI WORKSTATION
  
  9. A post-installation routine will run that will queue current
     workload information for transmission.
  
 10. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be  
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
 11. Insure that XXX@Q-NPD.MED.VA.GOV is entered as a REMOTE USER for the 
     mailgroup PCMM WORKLOAD FTEE MAIL GROUP. Local users may also be
     assigned to this group to monitor transmission messages.
  
 12. Using the Link Edit option in the Filer and Link Management Options 
     menu make sure the AUTOSTART field of the PCMM WORK  HL7 LOGICAL LINK
     is Enabled.
  
 13. Using Start/Stop Links option in the Filer and Link Management 
     Options menu start the PCMM WORK
     receiver as a background job.
