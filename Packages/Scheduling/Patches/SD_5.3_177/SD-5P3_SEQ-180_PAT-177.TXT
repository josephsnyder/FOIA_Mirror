Subject: Associate Provider

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 This patch makes changes to PCMM software, addressing some reported NOIS
 issues and adding new functionality.  The changes and additions are
 defined below.  If necessary, please refer to the PIMS User Manual -
 Scheduling Module, the Practice Profiling Software Requirements
 Specifications, or the online help for further information.
  
 Several new enhancements have been made to the PCMM GUI software to comply
 with the Practice Profiling effort.  The new functionality addresses the
 need to show a relationship between the Associate Provider (AP), the
 provider that sees the patient on a day to day basis, and the Primary Care
 Provider (PCP), the person ultimately responsible for the care of that
 patient.  This relationship will be established through the preceptor
 functionality available in PCMM.  
  
 New training materials have been developed and will be distributed in the
 following schedule:
 * Website - On or before 15 October, 1999, the PCMM Training Guide will be
      available for download from the VistA University Web Page.
 * Mailing to each site - On or before 1 December, 1999 the following will 
      be mailed to PCMM Coordinators and through normal distribution to
      each site: 
      1. New PCMM CD-ROM 
      2. PCMM Reports Pamphlet 
      3. PCMM Overview Pamphlet 
      4. Keyboard Shortcuts (laminated sheet)
  
  
 To support the new preceptor link the following changes have been made:
  
  
  
 ============== 
 Client Changes
 ==============
  
 PC Attending assignments can no longer be made.  With preceptor linkage
 there is no longer a need to utilize PC Attending assignment designations
 when assigning patients to positions.  The PCP will be established through
 the link.  All GUI screens that allowed PC Attending assignments have been
 adjusted to remove that ability: 
        Multiple Patient Assignment
        Multiple Patient Reassignment
        Position Information screen
  
  
 Preceptor Assignment
 On the Primary Care Team Position Setup screen under the current Staff
 Button a Preceptor Button has been added. The Preceptor Button launches
 the user into the Preceptor assignment screen.  The Preceptor assignment
 screen functions exactly like the staff assignment screen, except
 preceptor positions are selected/filed instead of staff.  The Preceptor
 assignment screen will include the name of the preceptor once assigned,
 the effective date of the assignment, status, and status reason. Preceptor
 history information will be retained and displayed. 
  
 When the Assign button is clicked the Preceptor Lookup screen will
 display.  The Preceptor Lookup screen will list all currently valid
 preceptor positions for the team.   Once a preceptor is assigned it will
 be displayed on the General tab in the preceptor field.
  
 Assignment of a preceptor position locks the precepted position and the
 preceptor position into a 'Preceptor Link':  for preceptor positions, the
 Staff Assignment form will not close if there is not a current staff
 assignment;  for precepted positions, the Preceptor Assignment form will
 not close if there are current or future patient assignments and there is
 not a current preceptor assignment.   When a position becomes part of a
 preceptor link, the 'Can Act As Primary Care' and 'Can Act as Preceptor'
 checkboxes on the settings tab will not be allowed to change.
  
 Positions with 'Can Act as Preceptor' checked will have the preceptor
 button disabled.
  
  
 Messages
  
 On the Messages tab, a Preceptor checkbox has been added for each message
 type.  Checking the box will result in the current preceptor receiving the
 mail notification in addition the current staff assigned to the position.
 The preceptor checkboxes will be disabled for positions with 'Can Act as
 Preceptor' checked.
  
  
 Patient Team Position Assignment Screen
  
 The information display columns have been changed to the following order:
 PC, Team Member, Position, Preceptor (PCP name), Standard Role.  The "AT"
 column has been removed.  The PC column will use an "*" to identify PCP
 positions and an "x" to identify AP positions.
  
 Staff Assignment Menu Button
  
 Due to the new, defined relationship between the position assignment file
 and the preceptor assignment file, the Team/Staff menu option to launch
 a user directly to the Staff Assignment form has been modified.  Direct
 access to team positions that are part of a preceptor link will not be
 allowed; staff assignments to linked positions must be mediated through
 the Position Definition form by either clicking the 'Staff' button or
 using the 'Assign Staff' sub-menu.  
  
 Team Patient Listings report
  
 As a result of the changes to the PCMM VISTA reports the Patient Status
 radio check box will no longer be needed.  It has been removed from the
 report form when this report is selected.
  
  
  
  
 ============== 
 Server Changes

 Outputs and Display Revisions:
 ==============================
  
 To accommodate the printing and display of assignment information related
 to the Associate Provider functionality distributed by this patch, the
 following changes and additions are provided:
  
 1. Non-PCMM Display Options
  
      The options 'Patient Inquiry' [DG PATIENT INQUIRY], 'Patient Profile
      MAS' [SDPATIENT] and the 'team information' action of the
      'Appointment Management' [SDAM APPT MGT] option are to be changed to
      provide a uniform, complete display of patient assignments. Displayed
      information will include Primary Care Provider, Associate Provider,
      and team assignments; as well as, non-Primary Care assignments that
      are active at the time of the display.
  
      In the 'Appointment Management' [SDAM APPT MGT] option, a line is
      added below the patient name in the header to reflect Primary Care
      Provider, Associate Provider and team.  
      [NOTE: This will result in changes to the 'SDAM APPT MGT' List
      Template.]
      
      Changes are also being made to the PCE and CPRS packages to display
      the new Primary Care Provider and Associate Provider relationships.
      For further information on these changes please refer to patch
      PX*1.0*78 of PCE and patch OR*3*65 of CPRS for details.
  
 2. Non-PCMM Report Options
  
      The 'Appointment List' [SDLIST] option is modified to optionally
      display Primary Care provider, associate provider and team
      information.
  
      The 'ACRP Ad Hoc Report' [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT] option is modified to
      include Associate Provider, non-PC providers and non-PC teams
      (current and historical) as selectable data elements for ad hoc
      reports.
  
 3. Existing PCMM Reports
  
      'Detailed Patient Enrollments' [SC PCMM DETAIL LIST PTS] - Logic is
      changed to screen clinics for selection against clinics assigned to
      selected teams.  Option menu text and output heading is changed to
      "Detailed Patient Assignments".  Columns are added for Primary Care
      Provider and Associate Provider.  Output is revised to 132 column
      format.
  
      'Individual Team Profile' [SC PCMM IND TEAM PROFILE] - Redundant team
      description lines are removed.  Total patients assigned to team is
      added to description.  Physician name, PC/AP, and # assigned columns
      are added to the report.  The report output title is changed to match
      option menu text.  Output is revised to 132 column format.
  
      'Patient w/Team Assignments' [SC PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN] - Option
      menu text and output title are changed to "Patient Listing for Team
      Assignments". Columns for Preceptor, PC/non-PC status, provider role
      are added.  Output is revised to 132 column format.
  
      'Practitioner Demographics' [SC PCMM PRACT DEMO] - Preceptor is
      displayed if one is assigned.  Person Class, position and standard
      role fields are included. Counts of patients for which the provider
      is a preceptor and total of assigned/precepted patients are added.
  
      'Practitioner's Patients' [SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS] - Preceptor name
      (if applicable) is added to the descriptive heading of the display.
      Summary output is reformatted.
  
      'Summary of Teams' [SC PCMM SUM LIST OF TEAMS] - Columns are added to
      the report for role and to provide counts of Primary Care and
      non-Primary Care patients for which the provider is the preceptor.
      Option menu text and output title changed to "Summary Listing of
      Teams". Output is revised to 132 column format.

      text and output title is changed to "Team Members Listing"
  
      'Team's Patients' [SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S PATIENTS] - Columns are added
      for PCP/AP status and PC/non-PC status.  Option menu text and output
      title are changed to "Team Patients Listing".  No-showed appointments
      are screened from appearing in the 'last appointment' column.  Output
      is revised to 132 column format.
  
 New PCMM Reports:
 =================
  
 PCMM Inconsistency Report
  Lists the inconsistencies that may exist according to the new Primary
  Care Business Rules, established in Phase II of PCMM.
  
 Historical Patient Assignment Detail
  Lists all provider, position and team assignments that exist for a
  patient during a specified date range.
  
 Historical Provider Position Assignment Listing
  Lists all provider position assignments that exist during a specified
  date range.
  
 Historical Patient Position Assignment Listing
  Lists all patient position assignments that exist during a specified date
  range.
  
 Historical Team Assignment Summary
  Counts of team and team position assignments within a specified date
  range.
  
  
 NOIS ISSUES:
 ============
  
 1. [NOIS: WWW-0199-51323, BHS-0799-12305, ALN-0799-11975, MAR-0899-20201,
 MAC-0399-61568, ALN-0499-10505, MAC-1298-61502, NOP-1198-12590,
 ALB-0499-50762, BRX-0299-10347, PHO-0499-60392]
 "-1 Staff Entry".  On the client, staff assignment changes will be
 validated against file 200 before a save action is allowed to continue;
 this will prevent the filing of "-1" pointers in the Practitioner field
 (.03) of the Team Position History file (404.52).  On the staff assignment
 form, to avoid date conflicts, activation date will default to today's
 date and inactivations will default to yesterday's date (if the assignment
 was not activated today).  The server API that determines current
 practitioner has been altered to return the latest assignment when there
 is a date conflict.  This will result in fewer 'No Current Staff Member'
 displays on the Team Position Setup form.
   
 2. BRX-1298-12322     NULLSUBSCR WHEN MULTIPLY ASSIGNING PATIENT
  
 3. PUG-0799-52997     UNDEFINED - TPDIS+45~SCMCMU2:1
  
 4. ALB-0799-52697     PCMM GUI NOT SAVING PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE
  
 5. TOP-0198-40107     NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH PCMM.  An allocation problem
 has been corrected by changing a local array to a global array.
  
 6. [NTH-0998-71441, NTH-0398-70670, NTH-1297-70652, LEX-0598-40066]  The
 Team Information display has been reworked.  Please see the Outputs and
 Display Revisions section above.
  
 7. DUR-1198-30945    PC TEAM POSITION SETUP, SETTINGS.  Unnecessary
 prompts to save information have been removed.

 Installation Activities
 =======================
  
 These changes are not being distributed through the national patch 
 module.  A set of files will be available from the appropriate CIO field 
 office 'ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE' directory.  Sites are encouraged to utilize
 FTP to obtain these files.  The following addresses will contain the
 files: 
 Hines                  152.129.1.110 
 Albany                 152.127.1.5 
 Salt Lake City         152.131.2.1
  
 These files include a host file (.KID) for the PCMM server code, an
 executable file (.EXE) for the PCMM client code and the various (.PDF)
 files for the corresponding documentation.
  
 SD_53_177.KID;1    - This file contains the KIDS build for the server.
 SD_53_177.EXE      - This file contains the InstallShield build for the
                      client.
  
 SD_53_177SCHUM.PDF  - PIMS Scheduling User Manual Changed Pages
 SD_53_177SCHTM.PDF  - PIMS Technical Manual Changed Pages
 SD_53_177RP.PDF     - Replacement Page List
 SD_53_177IGRN.PDF   - PCMM Install Guide/Release Notes
  
 The .PDF files can be read on a PC using the Adobe Acrobat 
 Reader browser program.  The .PDF and .EXE files are binary files, while 
 the .KID file is ASCII, so you must make sure when using the file
 transfer protocol, to enter the appropriate command for binary or ASCII
 file transfer.
  
 An installation document is being provided to instruct the IRM 
 personnel on the steps to install PCMM.  This includes both the client 
 and server sides of the application.  It is imperative that this 
 document is reviewed before an attempt is made to install this 
 software.
  
 The total size of SD_53_177.EXE is 1683 KB.  This file will load the
 following files onto each workstation:
 1. PCMM.EXE                    1369 KB
 2. PCMM.HLP                    115 KB
 3. RESIZER.DLL                 559 KB
