Subject: FY2011 TABLE MAINTENANCE CLINIC STOP (#40.7) FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2011 updates to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) 
 file as requested by the Decision Support Office (DSO).
  
                         ***IMPORTANT NOTE: ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch should be installed as close to COB on September 30, 2010 **
 ** as possible, but not after October 1, 2010.  Early installation of   **
 ** this patch could result in transmission of incorrect stop codes      **
 ** that will result in errors from Austin.  Coordination with the       **
 ** MAS PAS/ADPAC is imperative, as the patch will cause changes to the  **
 ** CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).  Testing can be done in a site's mirror    **
 ** account before installation in production to verify changes.         **
 ** This patch inactivates, creates and modifies descriptions of stop    **
 ** codes effective October 1, 2010, therefore, installing early may     **
 ** modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at your site. **
 ** It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that will        **
 ** incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as   **
 ** possible after installation.  Please keep in mind that new stop      **
 ** code corrections cannot be assigned until October 1, 2010.           **
 ** All other stop code corrections should be made as early as possible  **
 ** on October 1, 2010.  Sites need to coordinate their DSS CLINICS AND  **
 ** STOP CODES file (#728.44) worksheet maintenance to save the latest   **
 ** FY2010 values (as of Sep 30, 2010), and then not change the work-    **
 ** sheet to have FY2011 values until after the DSS Clinic (CLI)         **
 ** extract for September data has run successfully.                     **
 **************************************************************************
  
 INSTRUCTIONS FOR DSS:
  =====================
 There are two systems involved:  VistA and DSS.  VistA needs the FY2011  
 Stop Code changes to be in place ideally on the first day of the Fiscal  
 Year (Oct 1) for clinic setup purposes.  DSS needs the DSS Clinic Visit 
 (CLI) September extract run in mid-October to have FY2010 clinic values.
   
 The patch should be installed late Sep 30, 2010, or early Oct 1, 2010, 
 to  change the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7) so users will be able to set up  
 clinics and make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  Sites 
 need  to coordinate their DSS CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44) 
 worksheet maintenance to save the latest FY2010 values (as of Sep 30), 
 and then not change the worksheet to have FY2011 values until after the 
 DSS Clinic  Visit (CLI) extract for September data has run successfully.
   
  Steps to follow:
  ----------------
  1)  Before installing patch SD*5.3*570 - DSS must run the CREATE DSS
      CLINIC STOP CODE FILE [ECXSCLOAD] option late on the day of September
      30, followed by the CLINICS AND DSS STOP CODES PRINT [ECXSCLIST]
      option (Clinics and Stop Codes file #728.44) so that worksheet has
      the clinic setups that are applicable for September before FY11
      changes. Do this before installing the patch.
  2)  Install this patch (SD*5.3*570) in VistA late Sep 30, or early Oct 1.
  3)  After installing patch:
      a.  Run the NONCONFORMING STOP CODES CLINIC report that will search
          for clinics in the VistA HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) that need 
          changes.
      b. After running the report work with Scheduling to make changes
         (in file #44) to reported clinics so the new FY2011 stop code 
         changes will be in place for clinic appointments.
  4)  The DSS Clinic  Visit (CLI) extract for September is run in 
      mid-October for DSS workload. Once the extract is completed DSS will
      audit the extract.
  5)  Once the September CLI data is extracted and audited, then DSS can 
      make FY2011 adjustments in the DSS CLINICS AND STOP CODES file
      (#728.44).
      a.  Run the CREATE DSS CLINIC STOP CODE FILE option.
          This option creates local entries in the DSS CLINIC AND STOP
          CODES file (#728.44).It also compares file #728.44 to the
          HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) to see if there are any differences
          since the last time the file was reviewed.  Any differences or
          new entries will cause an UNREVIEWED CLINICS report to
          automatically print.
      b.  Use the option CLINICS AND DSS STOP CODES PRINT and choose 
          "Unreviewed Clinics" to print the list.  This option produces a 
          worksheet of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (I) Inactive, or 
          only the (U) Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting approval.  
      c.  Review clinics, update as needed using the ENTER/EDIT DSS
          STOP CODES FOR CLINICS option, and approve changes using the
          APPROVE REVIEWED DSS CLINIC WORKSHEET option.
