 *****************************************************************************
                                GUI UPDATE NOTICE                             
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                            
  The VistA Scheduling (VS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) v1.6.0 and       
  VistA patch SD*5.3*686 provide additional enhancements to the             
  VS GUI v2.0.0.15.                                                         
                                                                            
  SD*5.3*686 requires the installation of VS GUI version 1.6.0 to properly  
  function. Both SD*5.3*686 and VS GUI version 1.6.0 must be coordinated    
  and installed at the same time during the same maintenance window.

 Service Desk Manager (SDM) Ticket(s) & Overview
 -----------------------------------------------
 1. R18120703FY18/RTC 682003  Audit Data Error after selecting ALL in
 Audit Report
   
 Problem:
 -------
 In the Audit Report, when the user chooses ALL to run the report for all 
 schedulers, the system hangs for several minutes attempting to load data, 
 then finally returns an RPCException error code when the  connection times 
 out. This also terminates the GUI connection to VistA until they close and 
 reopen VS GUI.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The data for the Audit Report is now compiled by a nightly job so that much 
 less data needs to be transmitted to the client in order to use the  report. 
 Users will now be able to run the report for all schedulers  without
 encountering the timeout. In addition, the PRINT VISTA SCHEDULING  AUDIT 
 REPORT [SDEC PRINT AUDIT REPORT] menu option will allow a VistA user  
 to view or print the report in VistA.
    
 2.  R17039175FY18/RTC 682084 Consult lookup interaction errors
   
 Problem:
 -------
 When using clinic lookup in the VS GUI, if the user pauses typing, the  input 
 is wiped out and must be re-entered. A pop-up window appears if  the user's 
 input results in more than 50 matches and the input is erased.
 In addition, the user cannot refine the list of clinics returned by typing  
 additional characters.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 GUI changes made eliminating the pop-up window and responding to the  user's 
 input including narrowing the list of returned values when each  additional 
 character is entered. A new RPC was created for the GUI to  support this
 change. The new RPC returns a more limited amount of data so  that the GUI 
 can respond more quickly to the user's input.
    
 3.  R17265609FY18, R18547398FY18/RTC 883367  - All Multiple Return To
 Clinic(MRTC) appointments were automatically flagged as overbooks even
 when they were added to open slots.  Because of this they counted against
 the daily overbook limit preventing legitimate overbooks from being
 scheduled.
    
 Problem:
 -------
 All MRTC appointments were automatically flagged as overbooks even when
 they were added to open slots.  Because of this, they counted against the
 daily overbook limit preventing legitimate overbooks from being scheduled.
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 GUI code modified to correct the reported defect.
    
 4.  I15783947FY17 - When viewing or editing an Appointment Request, the
 current user's name was substituted for the name of the person who
 originally entered the request.
    
 Problem:
 -------
 When viewing or editing an Appointment Request, the current user's name was
 substituted for the name of the person who originally entered the request.
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 GUI code modified to correct the reported defect.
   
 5. R18477670FY18/RTC 682444 and 682527 Remote facility not updated when
 appointments made for Interfacility Consults (IFCs)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When scheduling an appointment for an IFC, the remote facility is not 
 notified. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) code for VS GUI did not include
 functionality in VistA Scheduling for the generation of IFC notifications.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified the RPC code to call a VistA Scheduling Application Programming 
 Interface (API) that generates IFC notifications.
    
 6.  R19462454FY18 - MRTC parent not reopening when cancelling child in
 Calendar/Pending Appointments.
   
 Problem:

 System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) packages have been developed for
 the distribution of the GUI to the  users' workstations:
 VA VistA Scheduling GUI_P 1.6.0P (GUI for Production) and VA VistA Scheduling
 GUI_T 1.6.0T (GUI
 for Test).
    
 SCCM administrators are responsible for the pushing of the above packages to
 the workstations. The VistA patch installation and the SCCM push must be
 coordinated for each site by the patch installers and the SCCM
 administrators.
    
 Step 1 (Core): All VistA sites shall install the VSE PRODUCTION and
 TEST GUIs on all workstations using the Configuration Management Control
 Board (CMCB) package provided by Systems Design (SD). The TEST GUIs will
 be used to provide training to VSE (VistA Scheduling Enhancement) users.
