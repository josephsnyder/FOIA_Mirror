Subject: PCMM PHASE III EWL REPORTS & PCMM FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Print Template

Description:
============

 This patch enhances Scheduling and EWL (Electronic Wait List) 
 functionality, providing the following enhancements and fixes:
  
 1. A new report which will break down the Wait List Specialties/
 Locations by totals of under 30 days, over 30 days and over 120 days.
 This report will summarize the categories and provide subtotals of each
 type and a grand total of all types.
  
 2. An enhancement/modification to the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Statistic Report 
 will allow the user to exclude any Teams, Position, Specific Specialties or 
 Clinic from printing/displaying the 'PREVIOUS REMAINING' and '# REMAINING' 
 from the report if the sum of these categories is zero.
  
 3. A modification was made to the header of the 'EWL Reopened Report'. 
 The header was changed to 'EWL Reopened Entries". This change was 
 made in the print template of the EWL PATIENT file (#409.3).
  
 4. The INQUIRE WAIT LIST (SCH/PCMM) Option was modified to ask "Do You 
 Want to View Only 'OPEN' Wait Lists? YES//" prior to the PATIENT prompt.
 If the user answers "YES" to this prompt only OPEN records will be displayed.
 If no open records are found two "??" are displayed and the PATIENT prompt is 
 again displayed.
 
 5. Impose naming consistency on PCMM HL7 Transmission internal identifier 
 variables. This has been causing problems when encountering a removal 
 notification for PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT (#404.43) entries, as 
 reported regarding undefined errors at CPYZPC+3^SCMCHLS.
 
 6. Modify the PCMM Mass Team/Position Unassignment processing when removing 
 a PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT (#404.43) entry. Previously, a simple 
 file removal was made, but the metadata kill logic would leave dangling 
 cross-references if the POSITION UNASSIGNED DATE was not set. This has been 
 changed so the date is set before the file is removed, eliminating the 
 cross-reference problem.
 
 7. The routine SDWLE had a missing patch number in the second line. Patch
 SD*5.3*415 was omitted in patch SD*5.3*446. The second line has been
 corrected in this patch.
 
 8. During the testing of SD*5.3*446, a command to unassign a patient from a 
 position in SCMCQK1 was commented out and not uncommented after. This patch 
 uncomments the command.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
   
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take 
 less than 5 minutes. Users may be on the system during this process.
  
   
   
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
   
  2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
     menu, select the Installation menu.
   
  3. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*524).
   
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
   
  4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     SD*5.3*524.
     
  5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion 
     of Install? YES//' answer YES.
      
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.  
      
  7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES
   
  8. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out
     of order, enter the following:
   
         Enter/Edit Wait List (Sch/PCMM)      SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT
   
  9. When prompted to select the protocols you would like to place out
     of order, enter the following:
   
         Wait List Entry                      SD WAIT LIST ENTRY
