Subject: PCMM output issues

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses several PCMM output issues, as follows:
  
 1. When using the 'Practitioner's Patients' [SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS]
    option to print ALL providers, teams, etc.; allocation errors occurred
    when a large volume of site data was encountered.  Changes are made to
    avoid this by storing provider lists in a global array rather than a
    local array.  The option 'Team's Members' [SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S MEMBERS]
    is also modified similarly to avoid the potential of this problem.
    Reported in NOIS # ALB-0297-50340.
  
 2. When using the 'Team's Members' [SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S MEMBERS] option to
    print selected or all divisions/selected or all teams, there was a
    possibility that not all of the selected or appropriate divisions and
    teams would be returned on the report because of how division
    name/division ifn collation was handled.  Collation logic has been
    corrected to provide complete return of indicated divisions and teams.
    Identified at VAMC Reno.
  
 3. The list of patients returned by the 'Patient w/Team Assignments' [SC
    PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN] option produced patient names in random
    order. This made it very difficult to locate a specific patient in the
    output. The report has been changed to print patient names
    alphabetically, within the collation of the practitioner they are
    assigned to.  Reported in NOIS # BAY-0299-31847.
  
 4. When queuing PCMM reports the user was presented with confusing
    queue time prompt content, such as:
  
       Start Time :  (2/19/1999 - 99/99/2699): NOW//
  
    The prompting utility has been changed to omit the date range values
    previously displayed.  Identified at VAMC Reno.

 Installation instructions:
 ==========================
  
   This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation will
   take less than 2 minutes.
  
  
  1. Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY
     section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this
     time.
  
  2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*181).
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any of the other changes.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines and
         options).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     SD*5.3*181.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
      When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
      order, enter the following:
  
         SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS           Practitioner's Patients 
         
         SC PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN    Patient w/Team Assignments 
    
         SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S MEMBERS      Team's Members 
  
  7. If any routines were unmapped as a part of step 1, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
