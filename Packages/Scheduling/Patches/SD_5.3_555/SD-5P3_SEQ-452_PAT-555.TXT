Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: SD*5.3*555 is released as an EMERGENCY patch with a 24 hour 
 compliance to address problems with Scheduling letters and rejection by 
 the U.S. Postal Service.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 The following corrections are implemented in this patch, SD*5.3*555, for 
 Scheduling Letters:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 1.  Printing of the veterans confidential address will list the veterans 
     State as a two character abbreviation, rather than the full name of 
     the State.
  
 2.  Routine SDLT is modified to look for 'UNITED STATES' rather than
     '1^UNITED STATES' to determine printing of a domestic or foreign 
     address.
  
 3.  Eliminate the printing of "UNITED STATES" when printing a domestic 
     address.
  
 4.  The comma placed between city and state will be removed, leaving one
     blank space between city and state for a domestic address.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------

 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000312845 - Address changes due to EVC
 HD0000000315893 - The country is printing on the line below City, State, 
                   Zip for United States Addresses
 HD0000000314855 - LETTERS WITH UNITED STATES
 HD0000000313250 - [SDPRLETTERS] having trouble printing patient 
                   address information 
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 =============================
  
 1.  HD0000000312845 - Address changes due to EVC
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The U.S. Postal Service rejects addresses that are too long.  Now, the 
 addition of printing the country, i.e., United States, forces the address
 to another line, making the address too long.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 This patch addresses the listing of State in long form when listing the
 veterans confidential address. Similar to the printing of the primary 
 address, State will be listed as a two-character abbreviation. The comma 
 placed between city and state will be removed, leaving one blank space 
 between city and state for a domestic address.
  
 2.  HD0000000314855 - LETTERS WITH UNITED STATES
     HD0000000315893 - The country is printing on the line below City, 
                       State, Zip for United States Addresses
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Local post offices are delaying letters with the United States printing
 on the bottom of the address because of how their machines read the
 address.  The machines look at the bottom line first and expect to see a
 zip code.  Those letters must be processed manually and the veterans may
 not receive their letters in a timely manner.
  
 Solution:
 ---------              
 This patch will eliminate the printing of "UNITED STATES" when printing a 
 domestic address.
  
 3.  HD0000000313250 - [SDPRLETTERS] having trouble printing patient 
                       address information
 Problem:
 -------
 When using the option Print Scheduling Letters [SDPRLETTERS], the patient 
 address information isn't printing correctly.  The address displays as 
 follows:
  
     Patient-name
     Street-Address
      City              << Note the space before city
     UNITED STATES
  
 Solution:
 --------
 This patch has modified the routine to look for "UNITED STATES" rather 
 than "1^UNITED STATES" when determining the printing of domestic or 
 foreign addresses.
