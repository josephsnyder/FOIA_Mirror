    REMEDY OVERVIEW:
    ===============
  
 1)  HD0000000063569 - RIC-0803-20101  PCMM Inconsistency Report not
                       working                              
    Problem:
    ========
  
    PCMM Inconsistency Report was not providing information for patients
    meeting this criterion:
    PATIENT HAS NO PCP ASSIGNED - Patient is assigned to a Primary Care Team
    but has no Primary Care Practitioner assigned.
    Routine SCRPV1A has code
                            Q:$D(^SCPT(404.43,"APCPOS",DFN,1))
    that incorrectly prevents subroutine CHECK28 from assigning
    S ^TMP("PCMM PATIENT",$J,DFNNAM,DFN,2,TMN,POSN)=PTPI ;..........#2
    that corresponds to a failure of generating the missing INCONSISTENCY #2 for
    a patient with assignment to TMN team and POSN position.
    Code Q:$D(^SCPT(404.43,"APCPOS",DFN,1)) does not determine properly if
    a provider is assigned to a position the patient is assigned to.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    
    Routine SCRPV1A will be modified to use the same call that is used
    to compute the CURRENT PRACTITIONER field (# 304)
    in the TEAM POSITION file (# 404.57):
  
    I $$GETPRTP^SCAPMCU2(POSI,DT)>0 Q
  
    where 
         POSI - a pointer to the TEAM POSITION file (# 404.57) determined
                earlier in the evaluated subroutine
  
    The implemented modification allows for proper identification and printing
    of the PATIENT HAS NO PCP ASSIGNED inconsistency.
  
 2)  HD0000000221359 - Modify PAIT code when an incomplete entry
                       in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file exists,
                       see ticket 221097, to avoid PAIT interruption.
  
    Problem:
    =======
    An incomplete node in HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) was reported in
    ticket 2210997. New code related to consults and introduced with
    SD*5.3*446 assumed that if a patient appointment node exists in the 
    Hospital Location file it must have a 0 node with data, i.e., if 
    ^SC(SDCL,"S",SDADT,1,SEQ) exists, then it assumes 
    ^SC(SDCL,"S",SDADT,1,SEQ,0) exists. Investigation of the PAIT 
    interruption caused by these incomplete nodes found that the
    corresponding APPOINTMENT multiple field (#2.98) in the PATIENT file
    (#2) showed the appointment 'canceled by patient' which means that its
    record in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) should have been deleted.
    So, routine SDRPA07 should assume that incomplete nodes should not
    exist.
  
     ..N SEQ S SEQ=0,SDCDATE="" F  S SEQ=$O(^SC(SDCL,"S",SDADT,1,SEQ))
  Q:+SEQ'=SEQ  
  
    I $P(^SC(SDCL,"S",SDADT,1,SEQ,0),"^")=DFN D  Q
  
    Solution:
    ========
  
    Routine SDRPA07 was modified to check for a complete entry in the 
    APPOINTMENT multiple field (#44.001) in the Hospital Location file (#44).
  
          ..;calculate consult date if applicable; 446
          ..N SEQ S SEQ=0,SDCDATE="" F  S SEQ=$O(^SC(SDCL,"S",SDADT,1,SEQ)) Q:+SE
 Q'=SEQ  I $P($G(^SC(SDCL,"S",SDADT,1,SEQ,0)),"^")=DFN D  Q  ;SD/528 added $G
  
    If PAIT encounters an incomplete node there will no longer be an 
    error. 
  
 3)  HD0000000249964 - <UNDEFINED>CHKENC+28^SDWLQSC1
  
    Problem:
    =======
    This error occurs infrequently, with the use of three different 
    options:
  
    Enter/Edit Wait List (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT]
    PCE Encounter Data Entry and Delete [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE]
    Disposition Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Entry [SD WAIT LIST DISPOSITION ENTRY]
    
    This error is thought to be caused by evaluating ^TMP globals not
    necessarily created by the same job because there is no check for a job
    number in the looping process. Another job running at the same time
    might create a similar, temporary global.
  
    The current code in routine SDWLQSC1:
  
  .I PROC N SS,SCNT S SS="^TMP("_$J_",""SDAMA301"")" F  S SS=$Q(@SS)
   Q:SS'["SDAMA301"  D
  ..N CL,SDP,SD S SDP=@SS S SD=+SDP,CL=+$P(SDP,U,2)
  
    Solution:
    ========
  
    Routine SDWLQSC1 has been modified to include - Q:SS'[$J - that prevents
    the looping from identifying incorrect data from another job.
  
  .I PROC N SS,SCNT S SS="^TMP("_$J_",""SDAMA301"")" F  S SS=$Q(@SS)
   Q:SS'["SDAMA301"  Q:SS'[$J  D
  ..N CL,SDP,SD S SDP=@SS S SD=+SDP,CL=+$P(SDP,U,2)
  
  
 4)  HD0000000256121 - 120 days related entry in file 409.32
                       incorrectly created with institution taken
                       from the Institution field in file 44.
  
    Problem:
    ========
  
    Entries for clinics in SD WL CLINIC LOCATION file (#409.32) may be
    incorrectly created with institution taken from the INSTITUTION field 
    (#3) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44). This problem surfaced
    during work on patch SD*5.3*446 and was missed during development of
    patch SD*5.3*491.
  
    While testing patch SD*5.3*491 the following message came out after
    installation of test v. 18:
  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Checking file 409.32 and 409.3 for valid national institutions, and pointers
 that don't match institutions of the Medical Center Division of their
 related Hospital Location
  
 The Medical Center Division for file 44 Clinic CLINIC (NNNN) has a
 different Institution than the file 409.32 entry for EWL.
 EWL Clinic INSTITUTION: ANYVAHCS - NNN
 Clinic INSTITUTION: VAHCS - NNN
 Updated EWL Clinic to match.
  
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This message indicated that an EWL entry was created with an institution 
    taken from the Institution field (#3) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file
    (#44), as it is before installation of patch SD*5.3*491.
  
    Routine SDM2 has the following code that as the first step identifies an
    institution in the Institution field (#3) of the Hospital Location file
    (#44).  Only if that field is NULL the institution value is retrieved from
    file pointer path to determine the institution from a clinic entry in
    the Hospital Location file (#44):  DIVISION field (#3.5) -->
    MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8) --> INSTITUTION FILE POINTER field 
    (#.07) --> INSTITUTION file (#4) rather than the INSTITUTION field (#3) 
    in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).

    This modification will allow for filing entries in the SD WL CLINIC 
    LOCATION file (#409.32) with institution taken from the 
    file pointer path to determine the institution from a clinic
    entry in the Hospital Location file (#44):  DIVISION field (#3.5) -->
    MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8) --> INSTITUTION FILE POINTER field 
    (#.07) --> INSTITUTION file (#4) rather than the INSTITUTION field (#3) 
    in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44)
    
 5)  HD0000000258287   Modify PAIT to identify institution  from a clinic
                       entry  through the  DIVISION field (#3.5) -->
    Problem:
    ========
  
      Appointments are occasionally transmitted in PAIT to 
      Austin with invalid institutions. The institution is primarily 
      determined by PAIT software as the INSTITUTION field (#3) in 
      the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44). The only option that populates this 
      field is the Record Tracking option Borrower Set-Up 
      [RT SYS-INDIVD-BORROWERS] but the primary option used to set up or 
      modify Hospital Location entries is Set up a Clinic [SDBUILD].  This 
      option does not populate the INSTITUTION field (#3), but instead 
      populates the DIVISION pointer field (#3.5) which indirectly determines 
      the institution by pointing to the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8) 
      which in turn has an INSTITUTION FILE POINTER field (#.07) pointing to 
      the INSTITUTION file (#4).
  
     Solution:
     ========
  
      PAIT software will now implement a better design using the
      following file pointer path to determine the institution from a clinic
      entry in the Hospital Location file (#44):  DIVISION field (#3.5) -->
      MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8) --> INSTITUTION FILE POINTER field 
      (#.07) --> INSTITUTION file (#4) rather than the INSTITUTION field (#3) 
      in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).
        
      All VistA facilities are responsible for proper configuration of their
      Medical Center Divisions with institutions, and the INSTITUTION file 
      (#4) is expected to be configured with correct Station Numbers. 
      All other data transmissions to Austin Automation Center rely on this
      path, and this approach will be consistent with the currently
      adopted functionality by other VistA modules.
