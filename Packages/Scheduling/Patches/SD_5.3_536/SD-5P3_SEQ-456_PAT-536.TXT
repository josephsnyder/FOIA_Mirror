Description:
============

 IMPORTANT NOTE: Activation of this application should be coordinated 
 between the individual at the site responsible for Recall Reminder and 
 IRM. Each facility will need to determine if they are running any version 
 of the Walla Walla Clinic Recall application.  The Walla Walla's 
 application was released a number of years ago with either a namespace of 
 A687 or AXVC.  Both applications use the OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL file
 (#687065).
  
 Introduction
 ============
 This patch contains the National version of Recall Reminder, which was 
 first released with the AXVC namespace. The software creates a 'holding'
 area for patients who need to return to a clinic greater than 90 to 120
 days in the future. Patients are entered into the software for the month
 they are to return. Upon arrival of the month, a postcard or letter will
 be generated, to be mailed to the patient reminding him/her of the need to
 schedule an appointment to be seen by their provider. The letter or
 postcard will instruct the patient to contact the VA to make an
 appointment that will be scheduled within 5 days of their phone call.
 Appointments will not be made in the Scheduling package until the patient
 calls to schedule it.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Sites that have determined they are running a version of the Walla Walla 
 Clinic Recall application will need to run options found in the Conversion
 Menu [SDRR IRM MENU], and remove protocol AXVCLR EVENT from SDAM MENU 
 protocol.  Additionally, all sites will need to add protocol SDRR EVENT
 to SDAM MENU protocol. This needs to be done after normal duty hours.  
 These instructions are included in the POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
  
 The Clinic field (#4.5) of the Recall Reminders File (#403.5) is not a 
 required field with this release.  It is also possible with this release, 
 to enter a past date in the Recall Date field (#5) and the Recall Date 
 (Per Patient) field (#5.5).  This is to insure that sites with the Class 
 III software can run the conversion routines without incident.  At a 
 later date, another patch will be released that will change the Data 
 Dictionary (DD) for the Recall Reminders File (#403.5) making the Clinic 
 Field (#4.5) required and updating the Input Transform on the Recall Date
 field (#5) and the Recall Date (Per Patient) field (#5.5) so that past 
 dates cannot be entered.

 The postcards are 4X6, govt. FL22 preprinted with the return address. 
 One side of the Postcard has the return address of the VA.  The patient 
 address information will be printed on this side by using Recall Reminder 
 print options.
  
 The other side has information the patient will need about calling in to 
 schedule the appointment. THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY SENSITIVE PATIENT
 INFORMATION INCLUDED ON THIS CARD. The wording on the back of the cards
 may be preprinted by an outside vendor or a site print shop. Below are
 examples of possible wording which may be changed at each facility if
 desired. When using the cards the only items that will print on the front
 of the card is the patient's address information, (FL if there is a fast
 lab), NFL (if there are non-fasting labs) and **## if the appointment is
 greater than 30 minutes. The print options will only print the front part
 of the cards.

 Below are two examples taking into consideration patient privacy 
 requirements.
 If a site chooses to print Recall Reminder Cards they must have a source 
 for printing the back of the cards.

 HEALTH, DERMATOLGY, ETC., OR DIAGNOSES MUST NOT BE INCLUDED ON A

 5. If your site has installed any version of Walla Walla's Recall 
 application please run the following options in order. If you are unsure 
 if your site has any version of  Walla Walla's Recall application check 
 to see if you have the OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL file (#687065) and 
 KIDS install AXVCLR*1.0*01. A site must have both of these items to be
 able to run the conversion options. Please read the instructions below the
 Conversion Menu before proceeding with the conversion.
  
 SDRR IRM MENU     Conversion Menu
  
    1         Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL PARAM
    2         Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL APPT TYPES

    4         Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL PROVIDERS
    5         Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL
  
 Run item 1 (Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL PARAM) - Only after 
 receiving a VistA email relating to step 1 should you continue with step 
 2. Each step will generate a Vista e-mail. Do not continue to the next 
 step until you have received the e-mail that shows the previous 
 conversion has finished for each file. 
  
 NOTE: When the Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL [SDRR CONV 
 OUTPATIENT RECALL] option is run, if a site added local fields to file 
 #687065 (OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL), they will not be converted to file
 #403.5 (RECALL REMINDERS). Also, entries in file #687065 which do not
 have an entry in Recall Date (field #5) will not be moved over to file 
 #403.5.
