Subject: PCMM Phase III Enhancements

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch enhances PCMM (Patient Care Management Module) functionality
 providing the following enhancements and major modifications:
  
 1. The background PCMM transmission error message will display the institution,
 message ID, team and position for each error. Also, sorting by institution will
 be added to the functionality of the PCMM Transmission Error Processing [SCMC
 PCMM TRANS ERROR PROC] option.
  
 2. The EWL (Electronic Wait List) Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Statistic Report [SD
 WAIT LIST STAT REPORT] will be modified to display/print the grand total
 of all categories at the bottom of the report.
  
 3. Additional fields will be added to the PCMM Historical Patient 
 Assignment Detail [SC PCMM HIST PAT ASSIGN DETAIL] report. The new fields
 to be included from the PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT file (404.43)
 will be USER ENTERING, STATUS, and LAST EDITED BY.
  
 4. The Inquire Wait List (Sch/PCMM)) [SD WAIT LIST INQUIRY] option was found
 to have a problem with the deletion of a VA Fileman screen introduced in
 patch SD*5.3*524. This problem is corrected in routine SDWLI and will
 be sent with this patch.
