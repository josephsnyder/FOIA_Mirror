Subject: PRIMARY CARE MANAGEMENT MODULE

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 The Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) consists of an 
 enhancement patch to the Scheduling Package (SD*5.3*41) as well 
 as one to Registration (DG*5.3*84).  This software is intended 
 to facilitate the implementation of primary care at sites.  The 
 PCMM release will use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to 
 control the startup, setup, and assignment functions.  This 
 functionality requires the use of (at a minimum) a 80386 CPU-
 based PC Workstation.
  
 The PCMM software is not being distributed through the
 National Patch Module.  Documentation and distribution files 
 may be obtained from the appropriate Customer Service 
 distribution directory.
  
 These enhancement patches that transport PCMM, contain the 
 following new and changed functionality to the existing PIMS 
 V.5.3 package:
  
   - Build and define Primary Care and other teams in DHCP,
   - Associate practitioners, other clinicians and
     administrative personnel to those teams,
   - Assign patients to Primary Care (and other) teams and 
     practitioners,
   - Associate new or existing clinics to a particular team and 
     team position
   - Make changes in those associations,
   - Review Primary Care information via a number of patient, 
     team member (practitioner) and team-based reports,
   - Alert providers that certain events involving team 
     patients have occurred (patient was admitted as an 
     inpatient, death entry, etc.), and
   - Provide some new DHCP reports and functionality relating 
     to the existing appointment functionality.
  
 The software is distributed in two files, which may be obtained 
 using FTP from the appropriate Customer Service directory:
  
 (1) SD_53_41.KID - This is a host file that contains the KIDS 
     builds for two patches:
       o  SD*5.3*41 - The Scheduling portion of PCMM
       o  DG*5.3*84 - The Registration portion of PCMM
     Together, these two patches contain the server software 
     needed for PCMM.
  
 (2) SD_53_41.EXE - This is a MS Windows(TM) software 
     installation program for the client software.
  
 Four document files are also available:
   (1) PCMMIMP.PDF    - Package Implementation Guide
   (2) PCMMUSER.PDF   - User Guide for PCMM module
   (3) PCMMRN.PDF     - Release Notes
   (4) PCMMIG.PDF     - Installation Guide
  
 Note: There is a typo in the Installation Guide in 'Appendix A 
 - Files Installed on Client Workstation':  The User Guide for 
 PCMM module is incorrectly identified as PCMMUG.PDF instead of 
 PCMMUSER.PDF.
  
 These .PDF files can be read on a PC using the Adobe Acrobat 
 Reader browser program.  The .PDF files are binary files, so 
 you must make sure when using the file transfer, to enter the 
 appropriate command for binary file transfer.
  
 Please read the entire installation guide prior to doing the 
 install.
  
 Release of PCMM is in conjunction with the release of the RPC 
 Broker V1.0.  It is strongly recommended that sites do not 
 attempt to install any portion of PCMM until they have 
 successfully installed both the client (workstation) and the 
 server (M software) portions of the RPC Broker.  The RPC Broker 
 client software comes with a 'Network Echo' program, that 
 serves as a crude test of the Broker software.  Sites should 
 successfully run all functions of the Network Echo program on 
 each workstation, prior to installing the PCMM software.
  
 For additional information, please refer to the four document 
 files listed above.
