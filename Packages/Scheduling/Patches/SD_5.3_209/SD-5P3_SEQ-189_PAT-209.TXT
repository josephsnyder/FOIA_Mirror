Subject: PCMM GUI lookup changes

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

  
  
 Y2K Waiver Exemption ID#:  Y2KWE0045
        This patch may be installed at any time during the Y2K Moratorium 
 (including the 12/15/1999 thru 1/15/2000 Y2K lockdown).
 (including the 02/28/2000 thru 03/03/2000).
  
  
 This patch will add functionality to the PCMM software to support the 
 following issues:
       * Check for duplicate patient last name and last four of the Social 
          Security number(SSN).
       * Check for the need for means test.
       * Screen out employee sensitive data during patient lookup.
       * Identification of sensitive patient records.
  
 All of these issues will effect the PCMM GUI screen for patient lookup when 
 making an assignment.  For additional information on these issues please 
 refer to DG*5.3*249 and DG*5.3*265.      
  
  
 * Check for duplicate patient last name and last four of the Social
 Security number.
   When a patient is selected the software will perform a check to
 determine if there is another patient with the same last name and same
 last four of the SSN.  If this condition exists, a message will be
 displayed to the user indicating this condition.  The user will then be
 asked if they wishes to continue.
  
 * Check for the need for means test.
   After the correct patient is selected the software will check to 
 determine if a means test is required for this patient.  If a means test is 
 required and the parameter to display messages for that division is set to 
 yes, a message will be displayed to the user indicating the means test 
 is required.  Once the user clicks on the 'OK' button they are allowed to 
 continue.
  
 * Screen out employee sensitive data during patient lookup.
   When a patient is selected during the PCMM patient lookup the employee's 
 SSN and date of birth are displayed.  The software has been changed so that 
 if the patient is also an employee the SSN and date of birth will be 
 replaced with the word 'SENSITIVE'.
  
 * Identification of sensitive patient records.
   A sensitive record check will be performed on the patient record 
 selected.  If the record is sensitive a message box will be displayed that 
 indicates a sensitive record is being accessed.  If the user wishes to 
 continue then a sensitive record access message will be sent to the 
 security office.
  
  
 SPECIAL NOTE:
 This patch has a client and a server portion.  The server portion is a

 to review the Installation Activities section of this patch description 
 before install this patch.
   The server portion of this patch is SD*5.3*209.

 Installation Activities
 =======================
 The server changes are being distributed through the National Patch
 Module. The client changes are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
 directories. Sites are encouraged to utilize FTP to obtain the
 SD_53_P209.EXE. The following addresses will contain the file:
  
 Hines                  152.129.1.110 
 Albany                 152.127.1.5 
 Salt Lake City         152.131.2.1
  
 The server changes can be installed first, with no adverse effects on the 
 current PCMM GUI users.  The new PCMM client will need to have the new 
 server changes installed in order to function.  Be sure to install the 
 server (KIDS) build first.
  
 This patch requires the following patches be installed:
 DG*5.3*265
 DG*5.3*249
 SD*5.3*205
  
  
  
 Server
  
 Installation of the server software can occur with all users on the system 
 except the PCMM users.  It is highly recommend that the PCMM users not be 
 running the PCMM software at the time of this installation.  The PCMM 
 server software (KIDS build) can be installed first because it will not 
 affect the running of the previous client versions of PCMM.
  
  
  Installation Steps
 1. The KIDs build is distributed via the National Patch Module and should 
 be obtained from there. 
  
 2. Send the PackMan to the account in which you wish to install the build.
  
 3. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the Routine 
 Summary section of this guide are mapped, they should be removed from the 
 mapped set at this time.
  
 4. From within MailMan select the message containing the KIDs build.
  
 5. Select the PackMan function  'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE '.  This will load 
 the PackMan KIDS build.
  
 6. Within the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' you may now elect 
 to use the following options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*209).
 a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message of 
 any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any changes such as 
 DDs or templates.
 b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow you 
 to view all changes that will be made when the patch is installed. It compares 
 all components of the patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc
 c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you to 
 ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 7. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package SD*5.3*209.
  
 8. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees. It is 
 recommended that you answer NO to this prompt. The trees will be rebuilt 
 next time the system does this task.
  
 9. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//", 
 it is recommended you answer NO. The disabling of the PCMM options will 
 help protect PCMM data.
  
 10. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of 
 order, enter the following.
 SC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION PCMM GUI Workstation
 SC PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN Patient Listing for Team Assignments
 SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS Practitioner's Patients
 SC PCMM REPORTS MENU PCMM Reports
 DG LOAD PATIENT DATA Load/Edit Patient Data
  
 11. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be returned to 
 the mapped set once the installation has run to completion. 
  
  
  
 Client
 The installation of the client software should take less than 5 minutes per 
 workstation. The following steps must be taken for each PCMM workstation.
  
 1. Download the SD_53_P209.EXE file from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory.
 a. Make sure to set transfer as BINARY.
 b. Get the SD_53_P209.EXE;1 file. Depending on the FTP software, this file
 might be placed in C:\WINDOWS, C:\, or some other directory. If you cannot
 find it, use Window' s File Manager' s Search functionality. 
 c. VMS requires the ";1" extension on this file. It is necessary to rename
 the file to SD_53_P209.EXE (without the ";1").
  
 2. Copy the SD_53_P209.EXE file into an empty (temporary or scratch) 
 directory.
  
 3. Run the SD_53_P209.EXE file (double click on it). This starts the PCMM 
 installation. 
 a. If all of the default responses are accepted, the PCMM software will be 
 installed into the appropriate VISTA directory on the user' s workstation.
 This version of the client software can be installed as either a patch to 
 the existing client software or as a new installation.
 The first screen is a welcome or introduction screen. After reading and 
 following the instructions, click on the NEXT button to continue.
  
 b. The second screen displays the directory into which the software will be 
 installed.  This is the default directory used for VISTA software. It is 
 recommended that you accept this directory.
  
 c. This next screen allows the installer to define the program icon that is 
 created.  Accepting the default is recommended.
  
 d. The next screen displays the type of installation, where the software is 
 going to be placed, and who is performing the installation.  Upon selecting 
 the NEXT button on this screen, Install Shield will install the PCMM 
 software in the target folder and set up the program icon.
  
 e. At the point Install Shield asks the installer if they wish to run the 
 application, PCMM is installed. There are no recommended responses at this 
 point. If the YES box is checked, Install Shield will start PCMM. If it is 
 not checked, Install Shield will finish and close.
  
  
 4. At this point the PCMM client is installed on the workstation.  
 Depending on how the user and operations folks have set up PCMM on that 
 workstation it may be necessary to make new shortcuts etc. to PCMM.
