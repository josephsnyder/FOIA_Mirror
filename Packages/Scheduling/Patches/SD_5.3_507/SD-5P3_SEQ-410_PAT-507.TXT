Subject: PCMM - Update Standard Position File

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  
 Recently released patch SD*5.3*297 began enforcing business rules for 
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) Primary Care Provider Person Class.
 A valid Primary Care Provider must have an active Person Class in the NEW
 PERSON file (200) and a correct mapping of Person Class to the STANDARD
 POSITION (403.46) file.
  
 In PCMM, the mapping of Person Class and Standard Position is established
 in the STANDARD POSITION file, field #2, Person Class, which is a pointer
 to the PERSON CLASS file (8932.1). This field may have multiple values.
 In most cases, several Person Classes are mapped to a single Standard 
 Position. A problem arises when a site selects a Person Class for the 
 Provider that is not mapped in the STANDARD POSITION file. PCMM software
 considers an unmapped Person Class as invalid.
  
 One feature of SD*5.3*297 is the auto inactivation of PCMM Providers whose
 Person Class is invalid. Auto inactivation of such Providers is scheduled
 to occur six months after the installation of SD*5.3*297. In some cases,
 the Provider may be valid and simply lack a correct Person Class mapping.
 To correct this issue, the PCMM development team has been provided a
 mapping of Person Class and Standard Position by the PERSON CLASS file
 caretakers.
  
  ** A compliance date of May 30 for installation is necessary. This
  allows sites approximately 2 weeks to install and a month before the
  provider inactivations (related to patch SD*5.3*297) occur. This patch 
  may be installed out of sequence. **
