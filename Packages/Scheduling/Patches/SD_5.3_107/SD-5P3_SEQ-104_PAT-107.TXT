 Subject: SD*5.3*107 DD - PCMM - TEAM NAME UPDATE
  
 Description: 
 ============
  
 This patch to the Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) consists of a
 routine and data dictionary patch to the Scheduling Package (SD*5.3*107).
 The patch is distributed via the National Patch Module.
  
 The main problem corrected by this patch occurs when changing the name of
 an existing PCMM team.  The SC('TEAM' cross-reference in the hospital
 location file (#44) is not being correctly updated by the 'ASCTEAM'
 cross-reference on the .01 field of the TEAM file (404.51)  The partial
 data dictionary patch included here corrects this cross-reference in the
 TEAM file, and the patch to routine SCMCDD2 corrects the associated code.
 A post-install routine will run to clean up and resynchronize the
 ^SC('TEAM' cross-reference with the existing data in the TEAM and TEAM
 POSITION files. 
  
 A secondary problem whereby the list of available team positions was
 incorrectly retrieving field 8 instead of field 9 of the TEAM POSITION
 file (404.57) for the associated clinic has been corrected in routine
 SCMCDD1.  Both problems were reported in NOIS PRO-0297-11606.
  
 The patch consists of the enclosed PackMan message.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 Patches SD*5.3*41 and SD*5.3*89 must be installed prior to installing the 
 software in this patch.
  
 This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
 to users.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu and 
       answer NO to the question 'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a 
       separate back-up message ?'.  Respond YES at the prompt 'Want to
       Continue with Load? YES//'.
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*107):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*107.
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Options?
       YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you
       would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
             SC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION          PCMM GUI Workstation 
  
   7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
       to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate 
       CPUs.  Alternately, you can wait until the installation is
       complete and move the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY
       section to all systems.
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
       completion.
   9.  Routine SD53107P may be deleted upon completion of the installation.
