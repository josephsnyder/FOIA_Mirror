Subject: MID-FY2014 TABLE MAINTENANCE FOR CLINIC STOP FILE  

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2014 Mid Year updates to the CLINIC STOP 
 file (#40.7) as requested by the Decision Support Office (DSO).
  
                         *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with a compliance date of April 1, 2014. *
 ** This patch should be installed as close to COB on March 31, 2014      *
 ** as possible but not after April 1, 2014.  Early installation of       *
 ** this patch could result in transmission of incorrect stop codes       *
 ** that will result in errors from Austin.  Coordination with the        *
 ** MAS PAS/ADPAC is imperative as the patch will cause changes to the    *
 ** CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).  Testing can be done in a site's mirror     *
 ** account before installation in production to verify changes.          *
 ** This patch creates and modifies descriptions of stop                  *
 ** codes effective April 1, 2014, therefore installing early may         *
 ** modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at your site.  *
 ** It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that will         *
 ** incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as    *
 ** possible after installation.  Please keep in mind that new stop       *
 ** code corrections should not be assigned until April 1, 2014 as they   *
 ** will not be accepted in Austin until that date.  All other stop code  *
 ** corrections should be made as early as possible on April 1, 2014.     *

 DSS Instructions for FY14 Mid Year Stop Code Patch (SD*5.3*609)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 This patch makes additions and changes to the Clinic Stop (Stop Code) 
 file (#40.7) as of April 1, 2014.
  
   - No clinic can be created using any new or reactivated Stop Codes 
     contained in the patch until after this patch is implemented.
  
   - Any clinics using a Stop Code inactivated by the patch should have an 
     active Stop Code assigned.  Assigning appropriate active Stop Codes 
     to clinics can be accomplished prior to patch implementation if 
     desired.
  
 DSS Site Teams, Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the 
 following sequence:
  
 1.) Run the DSS worksheet option Create DSS Clinic Stop File [ECXSCLOAD].
     Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so all clinics on
     the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of March 2014.
  
 2.) IRM installs the patch late on March 31 or early on April 1, 2014.
  
 3.) Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE REP]
     menu option, to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL
     LOCATION file (#44) for FY14 Mid Year.  Work with Scheduling staff to
     make changes in file (#44) so that the clinics will have the correct
     stop codes in place for April 1st clinic appointments.  DO NOT make
     changes using Enter/Edit to the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44)
     at this time.
  
 4.) Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for March 2014.  
     Updates should not be made for April stop code changes with the 
     Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] menu option prior to
     running the March CLI Extract.  Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI
     Extract.
  
 5.) After auditing the March CLI Extract proceed with FY14 Mid Year Stop 
     Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics:
  
     a. Run the Create DSS Clinic Stop File [ECXSCLOAD] option.  This
        option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file
        (#728.44) and compares the file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44)
        to see if there are any differences since the last time the file
        was reviewed.
  
     b. Use the Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST] menu option.
        This option produces a worksheet of (A)All Clinics, (C)Active,
        (I)Inactive, or only the (U)Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting
        approval.
  
     c. Update for FY14 Mid Year as needed using the Enter/Edit DSS Stop 
        Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] menu option.
  
     d. Approve changes using the Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic Worksheet 
        [ECXSCAPPROV] menu option.  Finalize all Stop Code changes on the
        worksheet to be ready to run the April DSS CLI Extract.
