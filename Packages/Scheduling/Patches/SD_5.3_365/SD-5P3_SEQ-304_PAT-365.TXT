Subject: CORRECTION FOR PCMM HL7 TRAN X-REF.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 **** NOTE **** This patch should only be run during non-peak hours.
 
 This patch addresses a problem with the PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION Log file.
 Following the re-seeding process the STATUS field was not updated to
 "ACCEPTED" and the "ASTAT" cross-reference was not changed from "T"
 (TRANSMITTED) to ACCEPTED. This error is causing excessive processing time
 due to the failure to reset the "ASTAT" cross reference correctly.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 ISB-0204-30121 Cross reference issue to initial seeding.
  
 Problem:
 ------------
 A cross-reference in the PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION LOG file (404.471) was not
 reset after the initial re-seeding process.
   
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 
 A post init routine will be created to correct the PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION LOG
 file and reset the "ASTAT", "T" cross reference and STATUS field.
 
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 ISB-0204-30121 Cross reference issue to initial seeding.
 
 Problem: During the initial re-seeding process, the PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION
 LOG file was not update correctly. The STATUS field (.04) was left as "T"
 (TRANSMITTED) and not as "A" ACCEPTED. This has caused longer processing time
 due to the large number of incorrect entries in the "ASTAT" cross reference.
 
 Resolution:  A post init routine was created to correct the STATUS field
 and the cross reference if the ACK RECEIVED DATE/TIME field (.05) is valid.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because the 
 some options will be out of service during the installation 
 process it is suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. 
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 Pre-install:
 
        (a). Verify the SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT job is not currently
             running.
        (b). If the job is running, wait on installation of this patch
             until it completes.
        (c). If the job is scheduled but NOT running, please use the TASKMAN
             Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] option to unschedule
             the SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT JOB.
 
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
    TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
    patch text only].
 
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
    from the mapped set at this time.
      
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*365)
     
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
     
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
    SD*5.3*365
     
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    YES//', respond NO
     
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES
  
    When prompted to select the options you would like to place out 
    of order, enter the following:
  
          PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation 
    has run to completion.
 
 9.  Post-Install
    
         a. Reschedule the SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT JOB with the original
            frequency and parameters used by your site.
 
         b. Routine SC40447P can be deleted after the istallation of 
            this patch.
