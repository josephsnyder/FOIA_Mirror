Description: 
============

 BACKGROUND
 ============
  
 With the onset of Practice Profiling the need to reliably identify the
 Primary Care Provider (PCP, the ultimate responsible provider) and the
 Associate Provider (AP, the provider who sees the patient on a day to day
 basis) has become an important issue.  The current functionality in PCMM
 would allow for the identification of these two providers but would
 require the creation of two assignments.  One assignment would be to the
 PC Practitioner and the second to the PC Attending.  This would add a
 large volume of work to the sites, especially when mass assignment
 functions are utilized.
  
 With the upcoming patch SD*5.3*177 (PCMM Phase II), PCMM will be changed
 so that only one assignment is necessary to identify the PCP and AP.   The
 current preceptor functionality will be key to this single assignment
 process. Under the new business rules, in order to identify the PCP and AP
 for a patient, a preceptor link will be set up between the two positions.
 The position that is being precepted over is the AP and the precepting
 position is the PCP.  Thus when an assignment is made to the AP position
 the PCP for that patient automatically becomes the staff member of the
 position that precepts over that AP position.  This linkage and the
 various business rules to establish it are described in great detail in
 the training materials provided with this patch.
  
 As a result of this new functionality, PC Attending assignments are no
 longer needed and will not be available for selection.  Assignments will
 either be PC or non-PC.  For sites that have utilized the PC Attending
 assignment, SD*5.3*195 will provide tools for the identification and
 conversion of the assignments that were made using PC Attending.  An
 additional report has been provided that will review current preceptor
 linkages for compliance with the new business rules.
  
  
  
  
 NEW FUNCTIONALITY
 ===================
  
  
  
 PC ATTENDING REVIEW
  
 This report will scan the PCMM database for all active and future
 assignments made with the PC Attending designation.  Results will be
 reported to the user via Mailman.  This is strictly a review report to
 assist the user with the PC ATTENDING CONVERSION option.
  
  
  
 PC ATTENDING CONVERSION
  
 This option will allow the user to convert the assignments from PC
 Attending to PC Practitioner.  This is the only thing that it will
 convert. The user is able to run this conversion in either a
 CHECK or FIX mode:  FIX will perform the conversion; CHECK will simply
 review.  Results will be reported to the user via Mailman.  The user is
 able to select the teams and positions (one/many/all) they want converted.
 The software has two basic checks it performs before it actually converts
 the assignment:
  
 1 - Does a PC Practitioner assignment already exist for this patient?  If
 so a second cannot be added.  The user will have to either discharge the
 other assignment or discharge the assignment that is trying to be
 converted.
  
 2 - Is the team assignment for this patient designated as primary care?
 When a patient is assigned to a team, PCMM asks if this is a primary care
 team assignment.  A primary care position assignment cannot be made
 without the team assignment being primary care.
  
  
  
 PRECEPTOR MIGRATION REPORT
  
 The Preceptor Migration Report loops through the Team file.  For every
 active team with entries in the Team Position file that have an entry in
 the Preceptor field, the report validates the position and the preceptor
 position against the standards for a preceptor link which will be
 effective with the release of Scheduling patch SD*5.3*177 (PCMM Phase II
 Enhancements). If the Team Position-Preceptor Team Position 'Link' meets
 Phase II standards, the report entry will show 'Preceptor Link OK';
 otherwise, the report entry will show "Position:" or "Preceptor:" and
 detail the faults(s).  Any entry tagged as 'Preceptor Link OK' will be
 migrated by the Post-Init of Scheduling patch SD*5.3*177 to the *new*
 Preceptor History file.  The intent of the report is to allow sites to
 review/edit existing preceptor assignments prior to migration to the new
 format. Results will be reported to the user via Mailman.
  
  
 New Options:
 ============
 Three new options are being distributed on the new 
 SCMC CONVERSION TOOLS MENU:
  
 SCMC PRECEPTOR MIGRATION RPT
 SCMC PC ATTENDING CONVERSION
 SCMC PC ATTENDING ASGN RPT
  
 SCMC CONVERSION TOOLS MENU is not attached to any existing VISTA option.
 The tools are intended for a one-time conversion of PC Attending data and
 display of preceptor information.  Therefore, this menu should only be
 given to the appropriate PCMM user.  The conversion options will be
 deleted with a future PCMM patch when it is determined that all sites have
 successfully converted.

 Installation Instructions
 =========================
  
 This patch can be installed with users on the system.  All of the options
 and routines are new.  No PCMM or other processes will be effected.
  
 Installation should take less than one minute.
  
 1. All routines contained in this patch are new.  However, if any of the
 routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be
 removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
 Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
 prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*195).
  
 a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message of
 any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT backup any of the other
 changes.
  
 b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow you
 to view all changes that will be made when the patch is installed.  It
 compares all components of the patch (routines and options).
  
 c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you to
 ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*195.
  
 6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
 Install? YES//" it is recommended that you answer "NO".  The option
 contained in this patch will be included in user up-arrow "^" jump
 functionality when routine site menu tree rebuilding is performed.
 If you elect to answer "YES" to this prompt, completing the installation
 of this patch may take significantly longer than the estimate provided.
  
 7. Add the menu option SCMC CONVERSION TOOLS MENU to the appropriate PCMM
 user(s) secondary menu.
  
 8. If any routines were unmapped as a part of step 1, they should be
 returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
