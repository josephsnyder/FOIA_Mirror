Subject: FIXES TO CLINIC WORKLOAD, CLINIC AVAIL, PROVIDER/DX REPORTS AND REMAP CLINIC

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct a problem that exists with the Workload Report
 [SDCLINIC WORKLOAD].  Specifically, nothing prints after the patient's SSN, 
 for scheduled Compensation and Pension (C&P) outpatient appointments.  
 This patch will also remove an unnecessary additional page (Table of 
 Contents) that prints at the end of the Display Clinic Availability report 
 [SD DISPLAY AVAIL REPORT] when it is sent to a printer.  This patch will 
 also correct a problem that exists when adding a single holiday to a clinic.  
 If the holiday falls on the first of a month, i.e. 01/01/2008, the Remap
 Clinic [SDD] functionality does not function properly.  This patch will also 
 correct a problem that exists with the Provider/Diagnosis report [SDAM 
 PROVIDER/DIAGNOSIS REPORT].  Presently, this report does not print
 any patient data when you select diagnosis codes that have a suffix of .9,
 such as 281.9, 284.9, 799.9, or any codes which have both a .9 and a .90, 
 for example, 799.9 and 799.90.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD221583 - SDCLINIC WORKLOAD Report question
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Currently, when running the Workload Report [SDCLINIC WORKLOAD], 
     nothing prints after the patient's SSN for Compensation and Pension 
     (C&P) outpatient appointments.  If it is an Inpatient with a C&P 
     appointment, the report will correctly print INPATIENT.  If it is 
     an Unscheduled Visit for a C&P appointment, the report will correctly 
     print UNSCHEDULED.  However, if it is a scheduled outpatient C&P
     appointment, nothing prints.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDCWL2 will be modified so that scheduled outpatient C&P
     appointments correctly print SCHEDULED after the patient's SSN on
     the Workload Report [SDCLINIC WORKLOAD].
  
 2)  HD216104 - Clinic Availability report prints unneeded Table of
                Contents page
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When running the Display Clinic Availability Report [SD DISPLAY AVAIL
     REPORT], if the user sends the report to a printer, it prints an extra 
     page containing a Table of Contents.  This information is not needed.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     Routine SDCLAV0 will be modified so that it no longer calls API
     TP^DGUTL to print the Table of Contents page.
  
 3)  HD143948 - Adding Holidays and not able to Remap Certain Days
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When adding holidays for a clinic, it was discovered that if the
     holiday falls on the first of a month, the Remap Clinic [SDD]
     process does not function properly.  This only occurs for holidays
     that fall on the first of a month.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDD0 will be modified so that a user can properly Remap a
     Clinic for a single day, for a holiday that falls on the first of
     a month, i.e., 01/01/2008.
  
 4)  HD180425 - SDAM PROVIDER/DIAGNOSIS Report
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Currently, when running this report by diagnosis, anytime the user
     selects a diagnosis code which contains both a .9 and a .90, such
     as 281.9/281.90, 284.9/284.90, 799.9/799.90, the report will not
     print any of the patient data.  This is because the "BA" cross
     reference in the ICD9 file (#80) drops the zero from the one code
     so that both codes appear as 281.9, 284.9 or 799.9, although they
     point to the correct Internal Entry Numbers for each code.  For
     example:
  
     ^ICD9("BA",281.9,1024)=
                     11857)=  <<<this IEN is actually for 281.90
  
     ^ICD9("BA",799.9,5570)=
                     12009)=  <<<this IEN is actually for 799.90
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDAMODO3 will be modified so that the background FileMan
     lookup (^DIC) will return the correct data and allow the report
     to print the patient data on the report when diagnosis codes, such
     as those indicated above, are selected by the user.
