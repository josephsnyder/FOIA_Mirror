 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
  
 1)  INC000000800055 - PCMM GUI is missing tab labels
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the PCMM GUI on Windows 7, tab labels are missing although
 functionality remains intact.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Added functions to the PCMM GUI that will dynamically override the Windows
 Message (MDrawItem) responsible for drawing the tabs.  User will then
 regain visibility of the tab labels after the tabs are drawn.
  
 2)  INC000000800065 - PCMM GUI has a black background in the Template
                       input box.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the PCMM GUI on Windows 7, the Template input box on the 
 Query Template Utility form has a black background with black font
 color.  User cannot read the options in this input box.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changing the background color of the Template input box on the Query 
 Template Utility form to white will allow Windows Themes to function
 properly within PCMM.
  
 3)  INC000000800069 - PCMM GUI has a black background in the Details
                       input box.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the PCMM GUI on Windows 7, the Details input box on the 
 Selection Details form has a black background with a black font color.
 User cannot read the options in this input box.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changing the background color of the Details input box on the Selection 
 Details form to white will allow Windows Themes to function properly
 within PCMM.
  
   
 4)  INC000000800073 - PCMM GUI will not load the Windows Help File.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the PCMM GUI on Windows 7, the Help File will not load thus
 creating an error.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Windows 7 no longer supports legacy versions of Windows Help Files. 
 The Windows 7 team has made changes to the current Windows 7 build that
 will include the legacy Windows Help Viewer.  Machines that have an older
 Windows 7 build will receive this update automatically.  An information
 dialog box has been added to the PCMM GUI giving the user the option to
 submit a remedy ticket in the event the user's computer was not 
 automatically updated.
  
  
 5)  INC000000800082 - PCMM GUI allows Captions to be overlapped by input 
                       boxes.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the PCMM GUI on Windows 7, Captions are being overlapped
 by input boxes causing the full Caption to not display correctly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Moving the input boxes one character space to the right will allow the entire
 caption to be displayed.
  
 Help File:
 ==========
 This patch includes an updated PCMM.hlp file.  No changes have been made to the
