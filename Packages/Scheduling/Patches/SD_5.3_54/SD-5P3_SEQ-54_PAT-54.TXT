Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch has an environment check routine that requires that SD*5.3*41 
 and XU*8.0*32 be installed prior to the installation of this patch.  
 (routine: SD5354EN)
  
 **Note: XU*8.0*32 is stored in the National Patch Module as XU*8*32.
            ===                                                 =
  
 (1)  In the PCMM GUI (client) software, if the value entered for patient 
 lookup matched a large number of patients (e.g.'SMITH'), the client 
 software would hang and a corresponding error (e.g., Protection 
 Violation, Allocation, etc.) would occur on the server.
  
 This was reported in NOIS CMO-0996-41036.
  
 With the changes to the routine SCUTBK11 and the remote procedure SC 
 PATIENT LOOKUP, the software returns the first 500 patients that match 
 the lookup value.
  
 (2)  The 'SC PATIENT LOOKUP'entry in the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994)
 is erroneously documented as 'PUBLIC'.  With the application of this
 patch, the DESCRIPTION field (#1) will be updated and the AVAILABILITY
 field (#.05) will correctly document the remote procedure as 'RESTRICTED'.
 In addition, due to the change made for problem 1, the RETURN VALUE TYPE
 field (#.04) will be changed from ARRAY to GLOBAL ARRAY.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation
 will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
     the Installation menu.  
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*54):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*54.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
     you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
        SC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION          PCMM GUI Workstation
  
 7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
     to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate 
     CPUs.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 9.  Upon completion of the installation of SD*5.3*54, the environment 
     check routine for this patch, SD5354EN, may be deleted.
