Subject: AMBULATORY CARE REPORT PROGRAM AD HOC REPORT ISSUE 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes an issue with the ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC
 REPORT] option for when the same Limitation Category is used more than 
 once: the software was ignoring that it should exclude other selections
 beyond the first selection of what to exclude.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000310443      - ACRP Ad Hoc Report Discrepancy
    Dup HD0000000404373 - ACRP Report some exclusions still in output 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If you run the ACRP Ad Hoc report for all Divisions, excluding
     Inpatient appointments, the resulting total of encounters for
     each Division is different than if you run the report for the same
     time frame excluding one or more Divisions and Inpatient appointments.
      
     For example, when the report was run for Fiscal Year 2008, for all
     Divisions, excluding Inpatient appointments, the report showed
     983,698 encounters for Gainesville, FL.  However, when the report was
     again run for FY2008, this time excluding Daytona and Leesburg, as
     well as Inpatient appointments, the report showed 1,062,462 encounters
     for Gainesville, FL, resulting in a difference of over 78,000
     encounters.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SCRPW26 has been modified to resolve this discrepancy. In
     essence, if the report was run with the same report Limitation
     Category used more than once, the software logic was ignoring the
     second selection. In this case, when the report was run the first time
     it looked like this:
      
     Include:  All Divisions
     Limitation Category:  Outpatient Encounter
     Limitation Sub-category:  Status
     Exclude list - Inpatient Appointments  
  
     When the report was run the second time it looked like this:
     
     Limitation Category:  Outpatient Encounter 
     Limitation Sub-category:  Division 
     Exclude list:  Daytona and Leesburg
     Limitation Category:  Outpatient Encounter 
     Limitation Sub-category:  Status 
     Exclude list:  Inpatient Appointments  
  
     Because the same Limitation Category (Outpatient Encounter) was being
     used twice, the software was ignoring the second exclude list, thus
     Inpatient appointments ended up being included in the total number of
     encounters for each Division that was included in the second report.
