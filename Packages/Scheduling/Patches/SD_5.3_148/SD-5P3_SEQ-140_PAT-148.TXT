Description: 
============

  
  
 It has been decided that PCMM will be used in the Practice Profiling 
 initiative.  As a result, a user group was assembled to review the 
 current NOIS and E3R issues. The panel decided additional functionality
 and correction to existing functionality would be needed. This patch is
 the first phase in a three phase effort to enhance and correct PCMM.  The
 following is a description of the changes and any associated NOISes that
 are being addressed:
  
 - Multiple Reassignment of patients.  This will give the user the 
 ability to reassign patients, using a GUI interface, from one team to 
 another.  As each of the patients are reassigned the team and position 
 assignments they are reassigned from will be inactivated.  The enhancement 
 in patch 148 addresses half of NOIS SDC-0997-62502.  Patch SD*5.3*157 
 will address the second half, Multiple Reassignment by position.  This 
 patch is expected some time in November of this year.
  
  
 - Mass Discharge of patients from a team or position.  A list manager 
 option has been created that will allow a user to discharge a single 
 patient, group of patients or all patients from a specified team or 
 position within a team.  A bulletin will be sent indicating which 
 patients were discharged and which were not.
  
 - Discharge of patients from a team.  Currently the PCMM GUI software 
 allows a user to discharge a patient from a team even if there are active 
 positions assigned to that patient.  The software will now check to see 
 if there are any active patient position assignments. If there are, a
 screen will present to the user the active positions and ask the user if
 they wish to discharge the positions and team assignments or cancel the
 action.  If they choose discharge, the positions will be inactivated as
 well as the team.  The following NOISes are addressed: DAY-0898-41175,
 MIA-0298-32684, ELP-0298-72791
  
 - Related to the above problem, the new Patient Team Assignment Review
 option is a diagnostic tool that reviews all PATIENT TEAM POSITION 
 ASSIGNMENT file (#404.43) entries with the corresponding PATIENT TEAM 
 ASSIGNMENT file (#404.42) file entries.  The comparison checks to make sure 
 that the position assignment active timeframe is within the team assignment 
 active timeframe.  It is recommended that this option be run soon after the 
 installation of this patch to identify problem assignments.
  
 - A partial DD of the PATIENT file is being distributed.  Two fields, 
 CURRNET PC PRACTITIONER (404.01) and CURRENT PC TEAM (404.42), are being 
 starred for deletion.  These fields are no longer used to store or obtain 
 the current Primary Care Practitioner or current Primary Care Team.  As a 
 result, the supported API that uses the PATIENT file fields has been 
 adjusted. The following NOISes are addressed: HUN-0397-20290,
 ELP-0298-72791, POR-0997-51348
  
 - A new role will be added to the Standard role file.  'Clinical Nurse 
 Specialist' has been added.
  
 - The Multiple Patient Assignment will allow an additional primary care 
 attending assignment when the patient already has a primary care assignment.  
 This has been corrected to not allow the addition of a new primary care 
 attending assignment if one currently exists for a patient. (SDC-1097-62019)
  
 -The Team - Position Assignment form no longer prompts the user to enroll a
 Patient in a clinic associated with the position if the patient is already 
 enrolled In that clinic.  The following NOISes have been addressed: 
 TAM-1297-31132, BED-0697-12105
  
 - The report Patient with Team Assignments was not pulling the correct 
 last 4 (SSN) for the patients.  This has been corrected.   The following 
 NOISes have been addressed : TAM-0398-31294, CHY-0498-50320, JAC-0898-71573,
 LEX-0898-41916, HAM-0598-21158
  
 - The Practitioner's Patient report will not print all of a 
 practitioner's patients when several patients names are the same or at 
 least the first several characters are the same and they are assigned 
 to the same position. This has been corrected with this patch. 
 (TAM-1297-31132)
  
 - A new option has been added, Primary Care Team/Posn Assign or Unassign.  
 This option will allow a user to assign and unassign patients to Primary 
 care teams and positions.  It is a roll and scroll option designed to allow 
 fast data entry of Primary Care Assignments and unassignments.
  
 The Patient Lookup dialog box has been changed.  A SEARCH button and 
 RETURN key functionality have been added.
  
 PCMM has been updated from the 16 bit to the 32 bit version.  This allows 
 for the use of the new V. 1.1 32 bit broker and the new File Manager 
 components and RPCs.  All the client Delphi code has been upgraded to 
 Delphi 3.   Some information in the 'About PCMM' help window has been 
 removed, related to this change.  Related NOIS messages:       
 (CMO-0898-40401, WPB-0898-30002, NIN-0698-40768)
  
 These changes are not being distributed through the national patch 
 module.  A set of files will be available from the appropriate CIO field 
 office 'ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE' directory.  Sites are encouraged to utilize FTP
 to obtain these files.  The following addresses will contain the files:
 Hines               152.129.1.110
 Albany              152.127.1.5
 Salt Lake City      152.131.2.1
  
 These files include a host file (.KID) for the PCMM 
 server code, an executable file (.EXE) for the PCMM client code and the 
 various (.PDF) files for the corresponding documentation.
  
 SD_53_P148.KID;1    - This file contains the KIDS build.
 SD_53_P148.EXE      - The executable for the PCMM client software.
  
 SD_53_148_SUM.PDF   - PIMS Scheduling User Manual Changed Pages
 SD_53_148_TM.PDF    - PIMS Technical Manual Changed Pages
 SD_53_148_MASS.PDF  - Mass Discharge Scenarios
 SD_53_148_RP.PDF    - Replacement Page List
 SD_53_148_IGRN.PDF  - PCMM Install Guide/Release Notes
  
 The .PDF files can be read on a PC using the Adobe Acrobat 
 Reader browser program.  The .PDF and .EXE files are binary files, while 
 the .KID file is ASCII, so you must make sure when using the file
 transfer, to enter the appropriate command for binary or ASCII file
 transfer.
  
 An installation document is being provided to instruct the IRM 
 personnel on the steps to install PCMM.  This includes both the client 
 and server sides of the application.  It is imperative that this 
 document is reviewed before an attempt is made to install this 
 software.
  
 The total size of the SD_53_P148.EXE is 2.7MB.  The PDF files are
 included in that EXE and will be installed in the 'docs' subfolder of the
 PCMM directory.  The PDF files take up approximately 1.27MB of the
 total space.  As a result of these size issues this EXE can not be placed 
 on a floppy disk.
