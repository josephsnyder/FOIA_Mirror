Description: 
============

 I. DESCRIPTION
  
  This patch introduces changes to the Vista Primary Care Management Module
  (PCMM).  The purpose of this patch description is to provide an overview
  of the functionality that will be delivered in this patch and to provide
  field personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install and
  implement the patch software.
  
  
  
 II. Functional Overview
  
  The functionality included with this patch will be added to the M (MUMPS)
  server side of the PCMM application and will not be added to the PCMM GUI
  client side of the PCMM application.
  
  1. PCMM Baseline Seeding
  
   The PCMM Baseline Seeding (SD*5.3*212) patch contains a new PCMM
   Baseline Seeding [SCMC PCMM BASELINE SEEDING] option. This option must
   be scheduled to run after the installation of the patch has completed.
   
   When the PCMM Baseline Seeding option/job is run, it will create a
   Primary Care Baseline Image based on all Primary Care Assignment
   activity between the run date of the PCMM Baseline Seeding option/job
   and the date the facility installed patch SD*5.3*177. Each assignment
   activity within the date range will create an entry in the PCMM HL7
   EVENT (#404.48) file, where it will wait to be transmitted to the Austin
   Automation Center (AAC) by the current PCMM background HL7 process.
  
   The post install program of the patch will set the 'HL7 Transmit Limit'
   (#15) field of the PCMM PARAMETER (#404.44) file to 2500. The PCMM HL7
   Transmission [SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT] option should be scheduled to run
   two (2) times a day in TaskMan. This will effectively limit the number
   of PCMM HL7 messages that will be transmitted to 5000 per day.  The
   limit is intended to prevent overloading both the VistA system and the
   Austin Automation Center.
  
   The PCMM Baseline Seeding patch (SD*5.3*212) will add three new data
   elements to the PCMM (A08) HL7 message that is sent from Vista to the
   Austin Automation Center (AAC).  The three new data elements that will
   be added to the PCMM (A08) HL7 message are Provider Name, Provider SSN
   and Assigning Facility.

  Installation Steps:
  ===================
  
    1. Send the PackMan patch message to the account in which you wish to
       install the build.
   
    2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
       will load the PackMan KIDS build.
  
    3. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the Routine
       Summary section of this guide are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   
    4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    5. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*212).
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
    6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package SD*5.3*212.
  
    7. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees. It is 
       recommended that you answer NO to this prompt. The trees will be
       rebuilt next time the system does this task.
  
    8. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//", it is recommended you answer "NO".
  
    9. When prompted to "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? YES//", respond "YES".  When prompted to select the
       options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
        
        SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION      PCMM GUI Workstation
        SC PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN  Patient Listing for Team Assignments
        SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS         Practitioner's Patients
        SC PCMM REPORTS MENU           PCMM Reports
  
  10. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  11. The routine SD53P212 that contains ENV/PRE/POST install items may be
      deleted from your system.
  
  12. NOTE: Please refer to section (VI) of the patch description that
      provides the instructions for running/queuing the PCMM Baseline
      Seeding [SCMC PCMM BASELINE SEEDING] option. This option must be
      queued to run once the installation of this patch is completed.
  
  
  
 VI. INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE PCMM BASELINE SEEDING JOB
   
  The following section describes the instructions and procedures for
  running the PCMM Baseline Seeding job.
  
  1. !!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!
     The PCMM Baseline Seeding job/option will create a Primary Care
     Baseline image based on all Primary Care Assignment activity between
     the run date of the PCMM Baseline Seeding option and the date the
     facility installed patch SD*5.3*177.  Each assignment activity within
     the date range will create an entry in the PCMM HL7 EVENT (#404.48)
     file, where it will wait to be transmitted to the Austin Automation
     Center (AAC) by the current PCMM background HL7 process.
  
     Run the PCMM INCONSISTENCY REPORT and the PATIENT TEAM POSITION
     ASSIGNMENT REVIEW reports.  Correct any problems found in these two
     reports using PCMM GUI and VistA before continuing.  Having a "clean"
     PCMM database will result in the greatest number of error free
     messages being sent to the AAC, resulting in less cleanup by the
     VistA site and a more complete national PCMM database at the AAC.
   
  2. Use the Taskman 'Schedule/Unschedule Options' option to define the PCMM HL7 
     Transmission [SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT] option to run two times a day
     selecting times when the system load is usually low.  At least 4 hours
     should separate the two selected times.
  
     Example:  VistA system has lighter loads at 9:00pm and 3:00am.
  
               RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY: D@9pm,D@3am
  
     Since the patch post install sets the HL7 Transmit Limit to 2500, this
     will effectively send out 5000 HL7 messages per day.  The goal is to
     not overload the VistA system or the Austin Automation Center during
     the Baseline Seeding process.
  
  3. Instructions for running the PCMM Baseline Seeding job:
  
     a) To run the PCMM Baseline Seeding [SCMC PCMM BASELINE SEEDING] job,
        please use the Taskman, 'One-time Option Queue' option.  This job
        does not require a device.  It is recommended that this job be
        queued to run at a time of low system activity.
     
        Example:
        --------
        Select OPTION NAME: XUTM MGR       Taskman Management
  
          Schedule/Unschedule Options
          One-time Option Queue
          Taskman Management Utilities ...
          List Tasks
          Dequeue Tasks
          Requeue Tasks
          Delete Tasks
          Print Options that are Scheduled to run
          Cleanup Task List
          Print Options Recommended for Queueing
  
        Select Taskman Management Option: One-time Option Queue
  
        You can only select OPTION's that have the SCHEDULING RECOMMENDED
        field set to YES or STARTUP.
        Select OPTION NAME: SCMC PCMM BASELINE SEEDING  PCMM Baseline
        Seeding
        Does this option need a DEVICE? NO// 
        Enter Particular Volume set if needed: 
        Requested Start Time: NOW//T+1@0100  (APR 08, 2000@01:00:00)
  
     b) Once the PCMM Baseline Seeding job has completed, a notification
        (mail) message will be sent to the user that ran the job.  This
        notification message will provide the results of the PCMM Baseline
        Seeding job.
  
  4. Stopping/Re-starting the PCMM Baseline Seeding job:
  
     a) The PCMM Baseline Seeding job may be stopped if necessary.  To stop
        the job, use the Taskman User option.  You must enter the task
        number of the job, then select Stop Task .
  
     b) To restart the PCMM Baseline Seeding job after it has been stopped
        using Taskman, contact NVS for instructions.
  
  5. Re-Running the PCMM Baseline Seeding job:
  
     a) It should not be necessary to run the PCMM Baseline Seeding job
        again, once it has successfully completed. However, if the need
        arises, the job may be run again.  Contact NVS for instructions.
  
  6. How long will the PCMM Baseline Seeding process take?
  
     The estimated time information below is based on experience at the
     test sites having approximately 25,000 total messages and sending 2500
     messages per batch twice a day.
  
     The PCMM Baseline Seeding process steps and corresponding completion
     times are as follows:
  
     a) PCMM Baseline Seeding job:  less than 10 minutes
  
     b) MailMan HL7 message generation and transmission:  2 hours per batch
        of 2500 messages.
  
     c) Acknowledgement messages sent from the AAC:  The AAC will process
        incoming PCMM HL7 messages and return acknowledgement messages
        once a day at 06:00 CDT (07:00 EDT) on Monday through Saturday.
  
     d) A site with 25,000 total queued PCMM Baseline messages should complete
        the entire Baseline Seeding process in approximately 7 days.  The actual
        number of days to complete the process depends on the installing site's
        daily volume of routine PCMM HL7 messages and the total number of PCMM
        Baseline messages that are queued.  Routine daily PCMM HL7 messages will
        be transmitted in the same batches as the Baseline HL7 messages using
        the 2500 message per batch limit twice a day.  Therefore, a site that 
        transmits 1000 messages per day of routine PCMM HL7 messages will
        only be transmitting 4000 Baseline messages per day (5000 message 
        per day limit - 1000 routine messages).
