Subject: PCMM DATA NOT LOADED TO NPCD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 I.  DESCRIPTION
  
 This patch will mark HL7 messages from the Primary Care Management Module 
 (PCMM) to be retransmitted to the Austin Automation Center (AAC) to be 
 loaded to the National Patient Care Database (NPCD) System.
   
 The purpose of this patch description is to provide an overview of the 
 functionality that will be delivered in this patch and to provide field 
 personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install and implement the 
 patch software.
  
  
 II.  FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 VistA sites may have experienced problems with missing PCMM HL7 data that 
 should have been stored in the Austin, Texas NPCD System between October 
 23, 2000 to October 31, 2000
  
 By comparing local VistA reports of PCMM data against the Weekly Report 
 of PCMM Records Stored in NPCD by Station Number listing, it was determined 
 that the NPCD was reporting a much lower number than the site reported.
  
 It was also found by reviewing the Austin Weekly report, that from 
 October 23, 2000 to October 31, 2000, no PCMM HL7 data had been loaded 
 to the NPCD System.
 These dates will be used as the beginning and end search dates.
  
 The beginning period of time used per VistA site will be the October 23, 
 2000 date or the Baseline Seeding Run date.  Which ever is the most current 
 date.
  
 VistA sites with a Baseline Seeding Run date greater than October 31, 2000 
 will not be affected by this patch.
  
 All PCMM HL7 Acknowledged (Accepted Status) messages within the time frame 
 will be marked to be retransmitted to the AAC to be loaded to the NPCD System.

 III.  TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
  
 The following section describes the technical components of this patch.
  
 1. The post install routine will search the (#404.471) PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION 
    LOG file at the ^SCPT("ASTAT","A",IEN) node level for Accepted status
    HL7 transmissions that occurred within the search dates used.
    Those PCMM HL7 Transmission Log entries will then have their Status reset 
    to 'M' (MARKED FOR RE-TRANSMIT) in the (#404.471) HL7 Transmission Log file.
    This will flag them to be retransmitted to the AAC and loaded to the 
    NPCD System.
  
 2. A notification (mail) message will be sent to the user that ran the job.
    This notification message will provide the total number of HL7 messages 
    that were marked for retransmission.
    Also included in the message will be the Total Provider ID records 
    created since the Baseline Run Date that should be loaded to the NPCD 
    System.
    Please note, HL7 messages can and do create multiple Provider ID records.
  
 3. The following routine(s) will be included:

 IV.  SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL

 The KIDS build for this patch is:  SD*5.3*234
  
 There are no documentation changes/updates included with this patch.
  
  
 V.  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
  * This patch requires the following patch be installed:
    - SD*5.3*212
  
  * PCMM users should not be on the system at the time of this installation.
    Other packages will not be affected during the installation of this patch.
    Installation should take less than 60 minutes.
  
  * This patch should be run during off-peak hours.
 
  Installation Steps:
  ===================
  
  1. Send the PackMan patch message to the account in which you wish to 
     install the build.
  
  2. The PCMM link should be Stopped from running in the Systems Link Monitor, 
     of the main menu option [HL7 MAIN MENU].
     Use the Filer and Link Management Options, 'SL  Start/Stop Links' option 
     to do this.
  
  3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This will 
     load the PackMan KIDS build.
 
  4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select the 
     Installation menu.
  
  5. From the Installation menu, use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*234).
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
        backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
        installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
        templates, etc.)
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport 
        global.
  
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package SD*5.3*234.
  
  7. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is 
     recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be
     rebuilt next time the system does this task.
  
  8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
     it is recommended you answer NO.  The disabling of the PCMM options will 
     protect PCMM data.
  
  9. When prompted to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you 
     would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
      SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION        PCMM GUI Workstation
      SC PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN    Patient Listing for Team Assignments
      SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS           Practitioner's Patients
      SC PCMM REPORTS MENU             PCMM Reports
      SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT           PCMM HL7 Transmission
  
 10. The ^XTMP("SD53P234") temporary global will be used to save the run 
     time summary information.  This global will have a life cycle of 30 
     days from the date of installation of this patch.
  
 11. The PCMM link should now be Started in the Systems Link Monitor, of the
     main menu option [HL7 MAIN MENU].
     Use the Filer and Link Management Options, 'SL  Start/Stop Links' option 
     to do this.
  
 12. The routine SD53P234 may be deleted from your system.
