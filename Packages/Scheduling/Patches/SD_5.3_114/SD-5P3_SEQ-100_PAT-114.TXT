  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation
  will take less than 2 minutes.
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu and 
      answer NO to the question 'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a 
      separate back-up message ?'.  Respond YES at the prompt 'Want to
      Continue with Load? YES//'.
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*114):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
          (routines,DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*114.
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Options?
      YES//',respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you would 
      like to place out of order, enter the following: 
            SC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION          PCMM GUI Workstation
            SC PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN    Patient w/Team Assignments
  7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
      to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate 
      CPUs.  Alternately, you can wait until the installation is complete 
      and move the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section 
      to all systems.
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
