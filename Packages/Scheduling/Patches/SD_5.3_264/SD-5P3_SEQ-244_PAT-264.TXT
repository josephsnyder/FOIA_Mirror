 PCMM Phase I server side changes
  
 This patch is accompanied by PCMM GUI version 1.2.3.0. Combined these 
 changes
  
 1. Allow entry on Wait List from Patient Assignment in PCMM
 2. Provide for entry of Direct Patient Care FTEE hours when assigning a 
    provider to a PCMM position.
 3. On entry of Date of Death patients will be discharged from panels and  
    dispositioned from wait lists.
  
  
 When assigning a patient to a Team/Position and the team/position is 
 above capacity (and the patient is not assigned to another team or 
 currently on the PCMM wait list) a question will be asked to place this 
 patient on the Wait list. The user may optionally add a comment.
  
 When assigning providers to a Primary Care position in the GUI, users may 
 add Direct Primary Care FTEE. This field is a value between 0 and 1 up to 
 2 decimal places. Under the Team menu in PCMM there is a new option 
 DIRECT PC FTEE that allows entry/edit of this field value for currently 
 assigned providers on a team. A new report PCMM Direct Primary Care 
 FTEE [SC PCMM DIRECT PC FTEE] is in the PCMM Reports [SC PCMM REPORTS
 MENU] to show all the current Direct Primary Care FTEE
 values.
  
 A new protocol SCMC PCMM INACTIVATE ON DATE OF DEATH is added in this 
 package. This will remove (disposition) patients from the wait list when 
 a Date of Death is entered in the patient file. Also it will discharge 
 the patient from any PCMM Team/Position Assignments.
  
 The following options are included in this package
  SC PCMM DIRECT PC FTEE                         
  SC PCMM REPORTS MENU                           
  SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION
  
 The following Remote Procedures are included
  SC FTEE BUILD LIST                              
  SC FTEE FILE LIST                               
  SC PC PROVIDER                                  
  SC SC CONDITION LIST                             
  SCMC WAIT LIST ENTRY
  
 The protocol SCMC PCMM INACTIVATE ON DATE OF DEATH is included
  
 The Print Template SCMC DIRECT PC FTEE    FILE #404.52 is included
  
 The Sort Template SCMC DIRECT PC FTEE    FILE #404.52 is included
  
 New type crossreferences are added to the  PATIENT TEAM ASSIGNMENT 
 [#404.42] and PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT[#404.43] files.
  
 A new field PRIMARY CARE FTEE EQUIVALENT {#.09] is added to the POSITION 
 ASSIGNMENT HISTORY [#404.52] file.
  
 The scheduled SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT option will not be effected by the 
 installation of this patch.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 For additional installation information, refer to the Electronic Wait List
 for Scheduling and Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) Enhancements
 Install Guide.
  
  1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system and will take 
      less than 5 minutes. The Postinit will take additional time based on 
      the number of patients with Date of Death (see section 8)
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time
  
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your system.
      You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global. On the KIDS
      menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
  
          Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
          Select INSTALL NAME: SD*5.3*264
                               ==========
  5. Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
  
  6. Do NOT inhibit users from login into the system.
  
  7.  Answer 'YES' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols?
         
      Disable the following options during installation
           
    SDAM APPT MGT                 Appointment Management
    SCMC PATIENT ASSIGN/UNASSIGN  Primary Care Team/Posn Assign or Unassign
    SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION     PCMM GUI WORKSTATION
  
  8. A postinit will run that will discharge patients from active
     Team/Position Assignments who have a Date of Death. The program will
     update the display for each 5 year interval it starts and may take 10
     minutes for each 100,000 entries in the patient file.
     
     Deleting Traditional ASTAT CROSS REFERENCE from FILE 404.43
     Removing Patients with Date of Death from Team/Position Assignments
     Starting with Dates of Death in 1995
     Starting with Dates of Death in 2000
  
  9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be  
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  10. The following software file is exported as part of this patch:
  
    File Name               Contents                      Retrieval Format
    ---------               --------                      ----------------
    SD_53_P264.ZIP File(s) indented below                  BINARY
     - PCMM.EXE            PCMM Executable
  
    The file listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method
    is to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
    This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites
    may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
    follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
  
     PCMM.EXE will replace the existing Pcmm.EXE which is
     usually found in the Program File/VISTA/PCMM directory of the client
     workstation. Workstations without an existing PCMM GUI application
     installed should first download and run SD_53_P204.EXE to install the
     previous version of PCMM. Then the PCMM.exe should be replaced with
     the new version.
