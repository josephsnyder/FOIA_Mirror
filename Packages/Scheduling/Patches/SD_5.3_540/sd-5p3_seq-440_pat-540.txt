 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD0000000227158 - <SUBSCRIPT>ACT+4^SCRPW3 ^DPT("")
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The above subscript error occasionally occurs when running the
     Clinic Utilization Statistical Summary [SCRPW CLINICUTILIZATION 
     SUMM] report when it comes across an appointment contained in the
     appointment multiple of the Hospital Location file (#44) where the
     patient DFN piece is null.  It could never be duplicated nor
     determined how appointments are periodically getting set in Hospital
     Location file (#44) without the required DFN.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SCRPW3 will be modified to prevent future occurrences of
     this subscript error.  A new Remedy ticket (HD269016) has been
     logged for the DFN issue so that research will be continued to try and
     determine how appointments are occasionally being set in Hospital
     Location file (#44) without the required DFN.
  
  
 2)  HD0000000229509 - <SUBSCRIPT>SET+7^SDCWL3
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The above subscript error occasionally occurs when running the
     Clinic Workload report [SDCLINIC WORKLOAD] when it comes across an
     appointment contained in the appointment multiple node of the Hospital
     Location file (#44) where the patient DFN piece is null.  It could
     never be duplicated nor determined how appointments are periodically
     getting set in Hospital Location file (#44) without the required DFN.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDCWL3 will be modified to prevent future occurrences of
     this subscript error.  A new Remedy ticket will be logged for the
     DFN issue so that research will be continued to try and determine
     how appointments are periodically being set in Hospital Location file
     (#44) without the required DFN.
