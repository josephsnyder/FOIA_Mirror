Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*466  <<= must be installed BEFORE `SD*5.3*521'

Subject: AMBCARE DATA INTO AUSTIN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects a problem with the Ambulatory Care transmission 
 validation logic, which currently allows imprecise Confidential Start and 
 End dates to go through to Austin before getting flagged for the 
 reason: invalid or missing Confidential Start/End dates. The root of 
 the problem is being fixed with patch DG*5.3*766, which will prevent 
 imprecise dates from being entered. This patch allows any errors that 
 exist to appear on the Incomplete Encounter Error Report [SCENI 
 IEMM ERROR REPORT].

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD198546 - Ambcare Data into Austin - Ste# 552 - Dayton
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The existing Ambulatory Care transmission validation logic allows
    imprecise dates for Confidential Start and/or End dates, when
    applicable. Imprecise dates for these fields are not accepted by
    Austin and therefore, these encounters are rejected by Austin for
    invalid or missing Confidential Start/End dates. It would be 
    advantageous for these errors to be detected and corrected before 
    they went to Austin.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCMSVUT2 has been modified so that when there is an imprecise
    Confidential Start or End date, the encounter will fail the validation
    check and generate VistA error code 2480 - Conf. Address Start Date is
    missing or the Conf. Start/End Dates are invalid.  The encounter will
    then appear on the IEMM Error report, as it should.
