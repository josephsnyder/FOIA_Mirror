Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*297  <<= must be installed BEFORE `SD*5.3*498'

Subject: EWL PCMM Team & Position Enhancements

Category:

  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  
  Patch SD*5.3*498 includes 5 updates to PCMM functionality:
  
  The first update is a change to the business rule pertaining to the 
  inactivation of a patient's PCMM assignment (introduced in patch
  SD*5.3*297). Specifically, the current rule stops the inactivation
  process if a provider change is found. This rule shall not be enforced
  once this patch is installed.
  
  Second, a utility has been created to clean up dangling pointers in the
  PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT file (#404.43). This utility loops
  through the PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT (#404.43) file and
  finds the pointers to the PATIENT TEAM ASSIGNMENT (#404.42) file. It
  will then prompt the user as to whether or not they want the utility
  to clean up the identified "Ghost Entries."
  
  Third, a utility has been created to check each team's Institution in
  order to make sure it contains at least the station's base numeric
  identifier. The utility will then provide a list of TEAMS whose
  Station Number association does not match the numeric identifier listed.
  
  Fourth, the patch will modify PCMM Security Key assignments to the VistA
  PCMM Main Menu, along with its associated menus and options. One feature
  of patch SD*5.3*297 was the organization of PCMM-related options in VistA
  into specific menus.  Unfortunately, the main menu was inadvertently
  locked with the SC PCMM SETUP key. The patch will correct the security
  key assignments to those recommended by the PCMM User Workgroup. 
  Integration Control Registration #4988, EDIT LOCK IN PCMM OPTIONS, has
  been approved. The changes in this area are as follows:
  
  The following OPTIONS will have the locks removed:
  
      SCMC EXTENDED REPORT
      SCMC FLAGGED
      SCMC INACTIVATED REPORT
      SC PCMM DIRECT PC FTEE
      SCMC PRACTITIONER FLAGGED
      SCMC PC STAFF AUTO INACTIVATE
      SCMC PCMM MAIN MENU     
  
  The following OPTIONS will have the lock SC PCMM SETUP:
  
      SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK 
      SCMC RETRANSMIT
      SCMC PCMM ERR CODE REPORT
      SCMC EXTEND A PATIENT
  
  The following OPTIONS will have the lock SCMC PCMM RETRANSMIT:
      
      SCMC PCMM TRANS ERROR PROC
      SCMC PCMM TRANS ERROR REPORT
  
  Fifth, the EWL Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Menu [SCMC PCMM EWL MENU] will be
  replaced with the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Menu [SD WAIT LIST MENU] within
  the PCMM Main menu.  This provides consistency of functionality in
  regard to exported menus and any future updates to the menus.
  
  The following OPTION will be deleted from the SCMC PCMM MAIN MENU:
  
      SCMC PCMM EWL MENU
      
  The following OPTION will be added the SCMC PCMM MAIN MENU:
  
      SD WAIT LIST MENU     
  
  In addition, the patch will correct routine SCUTBK1's second patch
  line from 4,297 to 41,297,498.
  
  **NOTE: During the installation of the patch you may receive the
  following warning:                               ~~~
  
  "*** WARNING, you are missing one or more Patches ***"
