Description:
============

  
 This patch enhances the Electronic Wait List module of the Scheduling
 Package version 5.3, providing new functionality by permitting patients
 to be placed on Wait Lists for multiple Primary Care Management Module
 (PCMM) TEAM and POSITION assignments.
 
 The current Electronic Wait List (EWL) software does not allow veterans
 to be placed on more than one Wait List for a PCMM team or position. The
 ability to provide the facilities with multiple Primary Care veteran EWL
 assignments is the primary feature of this enhancement.
 
 When prompting a user for Wait List Type, the system will display all 
 types of Wait Lists (i.e. PCMM team, PCMM position, Specific Clinic, 
 Specialty Clinic) regardless of current entries. An enhancement is
 introduced in SD*5.3*417 which will display the team associated with
 the PCMM position. This permits users to place veterans on Wait Lists
 for multiple Primary Care Panels. Patients cannot be placed on the same
 TEAM multiple times nor can patients be assigned POSITIONS not defined
 to the specific TEAM. POSITION assignment can be made multiple times for
 the same TEAM, but the same POSITION can be assigned only one time. Also,
 the display of POSITION(S) will include the TEAM associated with the
 POSITION for clarity.
 
 It should also be noted that users may assign a patient to a Wait List for
 a specific position. However, that patient must be assigned to the 
 appropriate TEAM prior to the position assignment.
 
 Also, a correction was made to routine SDWLE111 to correct an UNDEFINED
 error, as well as providing the user with the ability to enter either 
 upper or lower case input at user prompts.
 
 Also included in this patch are two corrections for patch SD*5.3*394. The 
 first problem was a logical error in the $SELECT statement in routine 
 SDAMVSC where the appointment type in the patient file was not being 
 selected. This resulted in the incorrect appointment type being reset in
 the APPOINTMENT multiple of the PATIENT file (#2) and in the OUTPATIENT
 ENCOUNTER file (#409.68).
 
 The second issue was a problem with the OUTPATIENT CLASSIFICATION STOP 
 CODE EXCEPTION file (409.45). The .01 level of this file is numeric, 
 rather than a pointer to the the CLINIC STOP CODE file. This condition 
 set a flag incorrectly and reported a clinic was flag for an exception
 when in fact it was not.
