Description: 
============

  
 I.  DESCRIPTION
  
 This patch introduces changes to the Vista Primary Care Management Module 
 (PCMM).  The purpose of this patch description is to provide an overview of 
 the functionality that will be delivered in this patch and to provide field 
 personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install and implement the 
 patch software.
  
  
 II.  FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 This patch corrects Primary Care Management Module (PCMM)-related NOIS 
 issues.  The functionality in this patch will be added to the (M)UMP's 
 server side of the PCMM application and will not be added to the PCMM GUI 
 client side of the PCMM application.
  
 The following NOIS issues will be addressed in this patch:
  
 1. PCMM Inconsistency Report P-MESSAGE Error.
    When a user selects the P-MESSAGE device as the output device for the
    PCMM INCONSISTENCY REPORT [SC PCMM INCONSISTENCY REPORT] option, 
    a software error is generated indicating an undefined variable, PAGE, 
    causing the program to halt prematurely.
    When selecting HFS as the output device, the resulting report file
    contained page breaks when there should be none.
    Patch SD*5.3*231 includes code modifications that correctly initializes
    the page count variable PAGE regardless of the device selected.
  
    References: [CHA-0800-31856, MAR-0800-21420, MAC-1000-61522]
  
 2. Summary Listing of Teams Report Includes Inactive Teams.
    The Summary Listing of Teams report (SCRPSLT) includes Active Positions.
    No condition exists to exclude the Inactive Positions on the report.
    Patch SD*5.3*231 includes code modifications that correctly tests for
    the Current Status.
  
    References: [EKH-0999-42936]
  
 3. Team Patient Listing won't display duplicate practitioner/patient names.
    When the Team Patient Listing [SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S PATIENTS] option
    encounters more than one patient with the same name or more than one
    practitioner with the same name, the report only reports the first
    patient or practitioner.
    Alert descriptions printed in the Practitioner field need expanded.
    The descriptions are used to alert the user that the patient assigned
    to that Team has yet to be assigned to a position and/or an active
    provider.  Within the header of the report, two additional lines have
    been added to explain the two descriptions.
    Patch SD*5.3*231 includes code modifications that will loop through
    all file entries ensuring all practitioner/patient groups are listed.
    Code modifications for displaying the new alert descriptions have
    also been included.
  
    References: [LEB-0799-21893]
  
 4. Maximum Number of Patients function not working in VistA.
    When adding team information from the Appointment Management screen,
    the user is not told if the team has reached its maximum number of
    patients.
    Currently the GUI PCMM application provides this functionality.
    Patch SD*5.3*231 includes code modifications that will display a
    warning when the team has reached its maximum number of patients.
  
    References: [GNH-0200-40292]
  
 5. Individual Team Profile & Summary Listing of Teams Reports don't match.
    The ITP - Individual Team Profile Report, correctly reports a provider
    as an Associate Provider (AP).
    The SLT - Summary Listing of Teams Report, reports the same provider
    as a Primary Care Provider (PCP).
    Patch SD*5.3*231 includes code modifications that will call an
    API (SCMCLK) to determine if the provider is an 'AP' or a 'PCP'.
  
    References: [SDC-1000-61581]
  
 6. Practitioner Patients Report Doubled.
    The Practitioner Patients report, (option PCMM Reports:  
    PP Practitioner's Patients), is incorrectly reporting 
    'Patients Assigned' counts when running the 'Print Summary Only'
    option, often doubling and tripling the counts.  The report correctly
    reports the counts when running the Detail option.
    Patch SD*5.3*231 includes code modifications that will correctly total
    all practitioner/patient groups regardless of which option is running.

                 NOP-0400-11394, NOL-0500-72331]
  
 7. Option PCMM HL7 RE-SUBMIT REJECTS [SCMC PCMM HL7 REJECTS] is out of order.
    Patch SD*5.3*177 incorrectly sent out this option.  The option name
    was changed after the original patch description was written.
    The correct way to access rejects is through the PCMM REJECT
    TRANSMISSION MENU [SCMC PCMM REJECT TRANS MENU].
    Patch SD*5.3*231 will include an Installation Action that will delete
    this option.

 IV.  SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL
  
 This patch will be distributed in a Packman patch message through the 
 National Patch Module and should be obtained from there.
 The KIDS build for this patch is:  SD*5.3*231
  
 There are no documentation changes/updates included with this patch.
  
  
 V.  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
 * This patch requires the following patches be installed:
   -  SD*5.3*177
  
 * Installation of this patch may occur with all users on the system except
   PCMM users.  It is highly recommended that PCMM users not be running PCMM
   software at the time of this installation.  
   Installation should take less than 5 minutes
  
  
  Installation Steps:
  ===================
  
  1. Send the PackMan patch message to the account in which you wish to
     install the build.
   
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This will
     load the PackMan KIDS build.
  
  3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the Routine
     Summary section of this guide are mapped, they should be removed from
     the mapped set at this time.
  
  4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select the
     Installation menu.
  
  5. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*231).
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
        backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
        installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
        templates, etc.)
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package:  SD*5.3*231
  
  7. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is 
     recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be rebuilt
     the next time the system does this task.
  
  8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     it is recommended you answer NO.  The disabling of the PCMM options will
     help protect PCMM data.
  
  9. When prompted to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you
     would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
       SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION        PCMM GUI Workstation
       SC PCMM PT LIST W/TEAM ASSIGN    Patient Listing for Team Assignments
       SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS           Practitioner's Patients
       SC PCMM INCONSISTENCY REPORT     PCMM Inconsistency Report
       SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S PATIENTS     Team Patient Listing
       SC PCMM IND TEAM PROFILE         Individual Team Profile
       SC PCMM SUM LIST OF TEAMS        Summary Listing of Teams
       SC PCMM REPORTS MENU             PCMM Reports
       SDAM APPT MGT                    Appointment Management
  
 10. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion. 
  
 11. The routine SD53P231 that contains ENV/PRE/POST install items will be  
     automatically deleted from your system after the installation.
