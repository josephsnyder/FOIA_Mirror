  - Informational

Description:
============

  
 Description:
 ===========
  
 This patch contains changes to the Primary Care Management Module (PCMM)
 Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make it Section 508 compliant.    
 All of the changes in this version of the GUI are to address
 Section 508 compliance deficiencies and to improve PCMM's interaction
 with screen reading software. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
 Act Amendments of 1998 requires that when Federal agencies develop and
 maintain information technology, they shall ensure that the technology
 allows Federal employees with disabilities to have comparable access as
 Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.
  
 The PCMM GUI has been modified to allow screen readers, used by the visually
 impaired, to accurately interpret information on the screens.  As a result,
 some buttons and boxes have been moved, replaced or renamed and some screen 
 titles have been modified. 
  
 This version of the GUI should replace all previous versions and should 
 be provided to all administrative and clinical staff who deal with PCMM.

 Requested Changes/Modifications:
 -----------------------------------
  
 Modifications have been made to GUI components to address Section 508 
 compliance deficiencies and to assure screen readers can be used to
 navigate PCMM. Users who are not using screen reading software should
 not see any changes in the current functionality.
  
 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL
 ==================
   
 ** IMPORTANT** 
 THIS PATCH HAS only one PART -- A GUI EXECUTABLE INSTALL.
  
  
 GUI software files may be retrieved using FTP.
  
 FILE NAME                DESCRIPTION
 ----------------------   -------------------------------------------------
 SD_53_P483.ZIP           .zip file containing the PCMM executable used 
                          by PCMM users, PCMM Help file, PCMM Install.txt
                          and PCMM.GID file.
 SD_53_P483_UM.PDF        User manual update.
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is
 to FTP the files in binary mode from:  download.vista.med.va.gov.
  
 Files will be located in the anonymous.software subdirectory.
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
   CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
   ----------------   ------------------------    --------------------
   Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
   Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
   Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
 *Note: Files must be transferred in binary mode.
  
  
         ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
   
 No KIDS build is associated with this patch because only the PCMM GUI is
 affected. There are no VistA options to disable while installing the GUI
 executable. Users can be on the system or in the PCMM GUI during 
 installation.
   
 CLIENT FILES
 ============
 The following Client PC software is exported as part of this patch:
   
   File Name              Contents                Retrieval Format
   ---------              --------                ----------------
   SD_53_P483.EXE       PCMM GUI Executable         BINARY
   
 TO INSTALL AND SET UP PCMM.EXE DO THE FOLLOWING:
  
 1) EXTRACT THE FILES: Once you receive the SD_53_P483.zip file, save it 
 to your hard drive (do not run the pcmm.exe directly). Next, double click
 on the SD_53_P483.zip file and extract the files to the directory on
 your hard drive.
  
 2) CREATE A SHORTCUT: Once they're unzipped (extracted), go to that 
 directory, right click the mouse on the executable (PCMM.exe) file, and
 click Create Shortcut.  Drag that shortcut to your desktop.
  
 3) ENTER THE RUN-TIME PARAMETERS IN THE SHORTCUT:  Right-click on the
 PCMM shortcut, and click Properties.  In the "Target" box it will list
 the location of the PCMM.exe (for example C:\PCMM_483\PCMM.exe). Click 
 the mouse in the empty space after C:\PCMM.exe and press the Space bar
 to add a space after the C:\PCMM_483\PCMM.exe. Next, enter s= then the
 IP address, a space and then p= followed by the port you are connecting
 to. An example in the Target area of the shortcut:
  
 C:\VA\PCMM_483\Pcmm.EXE s=10.4.229.50 p=9573
  
 4) SAVE THE SHORTCUT PARAMETERS: Click OK to save the shortcut settings.
  
 5) RUN PCMM GUI USING THE SHORTCUT: Double click the shortcut to run
 the PCMM GUI.
