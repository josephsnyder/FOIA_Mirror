 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000357056 - Prompts are case sensitive and won't recognize lower-
                      case entries
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In Appointment Management, if the user selects Protocol RR - Recall
    Reminder Entry for a patient that has been previously set up with
    one or more recall reminders, a list of the recall reminder(s) will
    be displayed and the user will be prompted to either choose a
    corresponding number from the list (to edit) or enter 'A' to Add a
    new recall reminder.  If the user enters a lowercase 'a', the entry
    is not accepted and they are returned to the prompt.  This same
    issue exists with the standalone menu option Add/Edit Clinic Recall 
    Patient [SDRR CARD ADD].
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRR1 and SDRRCLR2 will be modified to accept an entry of
    a lowercase 'a', by converting the lowercase input to uppercase.
  
 2) HD0000000360263 - Change wording in the message in CPRS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a user selects a patient who has been set up with a Recall Reminder
    and selects the Cover Sheet page in CPRS, a list of the patient's
    scheduled appointments and any recall reminders appears in the bottom
    right-hand corner of the page.  If the user double clicks on the Recall
    Reminder date, a pop-up window will display giving information about
    the Recall Reminder, including the statement, "The patient will be sent
    a letter on this date reminding them to make an appointment with the
    listed clinic."  The wording of this statement is incorrect, as a
    letter would have to be sent prior to this date.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRROR will be modified to correct the statement to read,
    "The patient will be sent a letter prior to this date reminding them
    to make an appointment with the listed clinic."
  
 3) HD0000000362584 - SDRR PRINT MENU
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the option Clinic Recall Print Menu [SDRR PRINT MENU], 
    specifically Print Letters by Team, all letters are printed for the 
    selected team, instead of just those with Recall Dates that fall 
    within the selected date range.  This issue only involves printing
    Letters by Team.  All other print options, for both Cards and Letters,
    work correctly.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRRRECL will be modified to check the Recall Date against the
    selected date range and only print letters if the Recall Date falls
    within the selected date range.
  
 4) HD0000000365285 - <UNDEFINED> error with Recall Reminder print options
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the option Clinic Recall Print Menu [SDRR PRINT MENU],
    specifically Print Letters by Clinic or Print Letters by Provider,
    the user is prompted to enter a date range. If the user then 
    up-arrows ("^") at the prompt - Start with RECALL DATE, they will then
    be prompted for a DEVICE.  If they proceed and enter a Device an
    <UNDEFINED> error will occur when the software attempts to check the
    Recall Date against the selected Date Range because the date range
    variables are undefined.  This does not apply to Print a Letter by
    Patient or Print Letters for Nonresponsive Patients because those two
    options do not prompt for a date or date range.  Furthermore, this does
    not apply to Print Letters by Team because that option does not
    currently contain the required date range check (where this error
    occurs).  The date range check is being added for Print Letters by Team
    per Issue #3 above. It also does not apply to any of the Print Cards
    options as they properly exit when an up-arrow ("^") is entered at the
    date prompt.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRRRECL will be modified to check if a date range has been
    selected.  If no date range is selected, the option will be properly
    exited.
  
 5) HD0000000369271 - Extraneous text prints on the Letters for 
                      Nonresponsive Patients
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the option Clinic Recall Print Menu [SDRR PRINT MENU],
    specifically Print Letters for Nonresponsive Patients, the letter
    prints extraneous text at the top of the letter.  It prints the
    Internal Entry Number of the Recall Team and the Internal Entry Number
    for the Recall Provider.  For example: 1^1 (or whatever the applicable
    numbers are) will print at the top of the letter.  This issue only
    applies to the print option specified above.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRRRECL will be modified and the Write command will be removed
    so that this extraneous text no longer prints.
  
 6) HD0000000382715 - Display of Clinic Name on CPRS Cover Sheet
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Currently, the display of a Recall Reminder on the CPRS Cover Sheet in
    the box in the lower right-hand corner labeled "Appointments/Visits/
    Admissions" only includes the first 13 characters of the clinic name.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRROR will be modified so that the entire clinic name will be
    displayed on the CPRS Cover Sheet in the box labeled "Appointments/
    Visits/Admissions".
