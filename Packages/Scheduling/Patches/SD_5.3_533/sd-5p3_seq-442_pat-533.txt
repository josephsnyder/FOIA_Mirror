 REMEDY TICKETS OVERVIEW:
 ========================
 HD0000000239674 - Setting up a Midnight to 8am Clinic
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a clinic is set up for availability from midnight to 8am,
     Appointment Management works correctly, displaying the availability
     grid correctly and setting appointments correctly.  However, the
     Display Clinic Availability Report [SD DISPLAY AVAIL REPORT] does not
     print the clinic hours correctly. Instead of printing the hours as 0
     through 8, it prints 8 through 4.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDCLAV1 was modified so that the Display Clinic Availability
     Report [SD DISPLAY AVAIL REPORT] correctly prints the hours as 0
     through 8 for a clinic set up for midnight to 8am.
