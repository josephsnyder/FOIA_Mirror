Subject: ADJUST SSN/DOB SCREENING LOGIC IN PCMM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
  Patch SD*5.3*209 (PCMM GUI lookup changes), which was released on 2-9-2000,
  modified PCMM so that the SSN and DOB of a patient who had a primary
  eligibility of EMPLOYEE was not displayed during lookup.  This patch
  (SD*5.3*255) further modifies PCMM to fall in line with the expanded
  screening logic distributed by patch DG*5.3*391 (EXPAND SCREENING OF SSN
  & DOB AS IDENTIFIERS).
  
  Additionally, obsolete line tags DOB, SSN, and EMPL have been removed from
  routine SCUTBK11.  These line tags were only used during development of
  SD*5.3*209 and were not removed prior to national release.
  
  *** Please note that this patch did not require changes to the PCMM GUI ***
  
  
  This patch was tested by the Bay Pines VAMC.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch affects the PCMM GUI patient look-up process and should not
  be installed with active PCMM GUI users on the system.  Installation will
  take less than 2 minutes.
  
  Note: Patch SD*5.3*209 is a REQUIRED BUILD for this KIDS distribution.
        KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch without the
        prior installation of it.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only.]
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*255):
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*255.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//', respond NO.

      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
         SC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION     PCMM GUI Workstation
  
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
