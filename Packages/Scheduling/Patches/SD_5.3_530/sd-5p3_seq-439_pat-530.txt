 of the Patient Enrollment file (27.11) does not exist in the file.
  
 The second error addressed is an undefined variable error when running the
 ACRP Ad Hoc Report and selecting Report Limitation DATE SIGNED [DT] for
 Report Perspective PERF MONITOR [PM] category.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000226769 - $ZE=<UNDEFINED>ENROL+1^SCRPW24
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the ACRP Ad Hoc report and selecting Enrollments as one
    of the input parameters, this error will occasionally occur if an
    Internal Entry Number (IEN) found in the "C" cross-reference of the
    Patient Enrollment file (27.11) does not have an existing record in
    the file.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCRPW24 will be modified so that it now includes a check to
    ensure there is a valid record for any IENs found in the "C" cross-
    reference of the Patient Enrollment file (27.11).
  
  
 2. HD0000000239289 - SCRPW AD HOC REPORT erroring out
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT] and selecting
    Report Limitation DATE SIGNED [DT] as one of the Report Perspective
    PERF MONITOR [PM], the undefined error <UNDEFINED>D+2^SCRPW23 occurred.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A Post-installation routine, SD53P530, will modify the Data Dictionary
    of the ACRP REPORT TEMPLATE PARAMETER FILE (#409.92) to add DATE
    value for the TYPE SCREEN field (#7) of the category PERF MONITOR, 
    DATE SIGNED Report Limitation.
  
  
 3. HD0000000265246 - <SYNTAX>GETFILE+2^DIC0
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT] and selecting
    Report Limitation ACCEPTABLE PROVIDER [PR] as one of the Report 
    Perspective PERF MONITOR [PM], the syntax error <SYNTAX>GETFILE+2^DIC0 
    occurred.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A Post-installation routine, SD53P530, will modify the Data Dictionary 
    of the ACRP REPORT TEMPLATE PARAMETER FILE (#409.92) to remove an 
    extra space for the TYPE WHERE field (#6) of the category PERF MONITOR,
    ACCEPTABLE PROVIDER Report Limitation.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system, but because an option 
 will be out of service during the installation process, you may wish to 
 install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 3
 minutes. Users do not have to be off the system.

           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
        c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow 
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
           transport global.
        d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the 
           components of the KIDS build.
  
     4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
