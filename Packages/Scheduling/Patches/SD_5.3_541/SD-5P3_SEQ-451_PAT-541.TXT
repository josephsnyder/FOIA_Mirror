Subject: UPDATE PURPOSE OF VISIT FIELD IN PATIENT APPT MULTIPLE

Category:

 contains an invalid value in some records.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000208395 - UNPACKED+3^DDR
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was discovered that numerous sites contain invalid values in
    some appointment records in the APPOINTMENT sub-file (#2.98) of
    the PATIENT file (#2).  Specifically, there are many instances
    where older appointment records contain an invalid value of 5 in
    the PURPOSE OF VISIT field (#9) of the APPOINTMENT sub-file (#2.98).
    There are only 4 valid values for this field, as follows:
  
       2.98,9        PURPOSE OF VISIT       0;7 SET (Required)
  
                                 '1' FOR C&P; 
                                 '2' FOR 10-10; 
                                 '3' FOR SCHEDULED VISIT; 
                                 '4' FOR UNSCHED. VISIT; 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post-init routine SD53P541 will read through the PATIENT file (#2)
    and the APPOINTMENT sub-file (#2.98) for each patient and where
    applicable change the occurrences of an invalid value of 5 (or any
    other invalid values that are found) to a '3' - Scheduled Visit.
    The post-init routine will also generate a mailman message to the
    patch installer, indicating the total number of records that were
    updated.  A list of the actual records that were updated would not
    be feasible due to the possibility that it could be too large,
    thereby exhausting the storage space within the partition, resulting
    in a storage error during patch installation.
  
    If no records are found that need updating, the patch installer will
    receive a mailman message stating:
  
       No appointment records were found that contain an invalid
       value in the Purpose of Visit field in the Patient file.
  
  
 ***Please note, post-init routine SD53P541 will be deleted after
    installation of this patch.***
