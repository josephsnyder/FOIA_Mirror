  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  
   1) HD0000000225914 - User who made apt not showing
   
   Problem:
   ========
   The DATA ENTRY CLERK (#7) field and the DATE APPOINTMENT MADE (#8) field in 
   the APPOINTMENT SUB-FILE (#44.001) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION FILE (#44) are 
   not being populated when an appointment is made.  
  
   The DATA ENTRY CLERK (#7) field and the DATE APPOINTMENT MADE (#8) field
   are not populated immediately when an appointment is created.  Instead,  
   they are populated after several appointment related questions are answered. 
   If anything interrupts the process, the two fields will remain unpopulated.
  
   Solution:
   =========
   The DATA ENTRY CLERK (#7) field and the DATE APPOINTMENT MADE (#8) field 
   will be populated as soon as the appointment is created.
  
   Additionally, some locks in routine SDM1A will be brought into compliance 
   with the SAC.  
  
  
   2) HD0000000234375 - New Person file -- Enrollment Clinic
  
   Problem:
   ========
   At some sites, the ENROLLMENT CLINIC FILE (#2.001) sub-file of the PATIENT 
   (#2) file has an extra field the CATEGORY OF VISIT (#1.5) field.  At sites 
   where this field exists, it shares the same global location as the 
   REVIEW DATE (#5) field.  
  
   The Database Administrator verified that this field does not exist in 
   their "PLATINUM" database. Additionally, two fields are not permitted to 
   share the same global location.
  
   Solution:
   =========
   The extra field will be deleted if it exists.  Data in the file will remain 
   unaffected by the deletion.  
  
  
   3) HD0000000271347 - OUTPUT OF "DATA ENTRY CLERK" IN PATIENT FILE NOT 
                        PRINTING
  
   Problem:
   ========
   The DATA ENTRY CLERK (#19) field and the DATE APPT MADE (#20) field 
   in the APPOINTMENT SUB-FILE (#2.98) of the PATIENT (#2) file are not 
   being populated when an appointment is made.
  
   Solution:
   =========
   The DATA ENTRY CLERK (#19) field and the DATE APPT MADE (#20) field 
   in the APPOINTMENT SUB-FILE (#2.98) of the PATIENT (#2) file will be 
   populated when an appointment is made.
  
   Additionally, the post-install routine will attempt to populate any missing 
   values for appointments from 10/01/08 forward. The missing values are 
   retrieved from the APPOINTMENT SUB-FILE (#44.001) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION 
   FILE (#44).  The entries in the two files are matched by the patient, 
   clinic, and appointment date/time. 
  
  
   4) HD0000000327938 - Service connected type not being recognized by 
                        scheduling when passed through Quasar. 
  
   Problem:
   ========
   From the New Clinic Visits [NEW VISITS ACKQAS VISIT ENTRY] menu option, when 
   checking out a patient that has a Combat Classification, the appointment does
   not properly check out if the appointment was scheduled as "Compensation and 
   Pension", "Organ Donor", "Prima Facia" or "Research".  The appointment shows
   as "Act Req/Checked Out"  in Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] and
   requires the user to choose whether or not the appointment is "Service
   Connected" to complete the check-out process.
   
   Solution:
   =========
   A modification was made to Routine SDCO22 that checks to see if the
   appointment is being checked out through Quasar.  If so, a flag is set
   for the Service connected field to be populated.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
  This patch may be run with users on the system. As several options are 
  going to be out of order, it is recommended that this patch be installed 
  during off-peak hours.  
  
  The post-install routine SD53P544 may be deleted after patch installation.  
  
  Installation could take an hour or more depending on the size of the
