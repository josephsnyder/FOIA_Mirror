Subject: Patient Team Assign, PCMM Error & Preceptor Link, File & Rept. Correction

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
 1). Problem with the Patient Team assignment not showing correctly within
     the CPRS package. 
  
 2). The following error will also be fixed:
  
     <SUBSCRIPT>SORT+39^SCMCHLR2 when working in the PCMM Transmission 
     Error Processing [SCMC PCMM TRANS ERROR PROC] option.
  
 3). The OUTPATIENT PROFILE (#404.41) file fields 201-204 will
     be distributed with the proper documentation as currently it states
     incorrectly that these fields are not implemented. 
  
 4). The inclusion of all 13 options on the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) 
     Reports [SD WAIT LIST REPORTS MENU]. Five of them were unintentionally
     detached with previously released patch SD*5.3*297.
  
 5). There is a problem with the Preceptor Link not being updated 
     correctly.  In some cases, the user receives a message that the
     Preceptor Position requires a staff assignment. In other cases, the
     user just isn't allowed to remove the staff assignment or the
     preceptor assignment. The confusion comes in as the Preceptor Team
     Position may be inactive but the status of the Preceptor link may see
     it as active since it was not updated correctly. Changes are not saved
     because the "AD" MUMPS cross-reference is not being updated correctly.
     This cross-reference is triggered by the PRECEPTOR TEAM POSITION
     (#.06) field of the PRECEPTOR ASSIGNMENT HISTORY (#404.53) file.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD185928 Assignments not showing up in CPRS for provider.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The PCMM assignment header in CPRS is not showing the TEAM assignment
 correctly. The remote procedure call ORWPT1 PCDETAIL chooses the wrong
 entry when the patient has multiple entries for the same date/team
 assignment or same date/multiple team assignments. It selects the first
 entry which is not the most recent. In selecting the first entry it may
 find an inactivated entry and not return the correct Team assignment or if
 there is not an inactivated entry it could return the wrong team.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCAPMCU2 will be modified to select the latest and most current
 entry and report the Team assignment correctly.
  
   
 2. HD64077 HEH-0704-41807 SORT+39^SCMCHLR2 ERROR
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the ER PCMM Transmission Error Report [SCMC PCMM TRANS 
 ERROR REPORT] from within the PCMM HL7 AND MAINTENANCE MENU [SCMC HL7 
 MENU] option with selection:  A (All Errors) | P (Provider) | 1 (New), 2
 (Checked) or 3 (Both), the following error <SUBSCRIPT>SORT+39^SCMCHLR2
 occurs because of a logical error in routine SCMCHLR2 that does not
 terminate processing when a valid HL7 ID is not found.
  
 Solution:
 --------
 The routine in question SCMCHLR2 will be modified to not continue with 
 processing when a valid HL7 ID is not found. This will resolve the error 
 condition reported. 
  
  
 3. HD63259 ISB-1201-32447 Misleading field descriptions in OUTPATIENT 
 PROFILE (#404.41) file.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The field descriptions for fields 201-204 incorrectly state that the 
 fields have not been implemented, and field 201 has a misspelling
 'This is calcultes' instead of 'This calculates'.

 5. HD183442 Issue with deactivating a provider in PCMM.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users are unable to remove the staff assignment from preceptor positions 
 as the cross reference for Status ("AD") is not being updated properly. 
 The MUMPS cross-reference 'AD' on PRECEPTOR TEAM POSITION (#.06) field 
 in the PRECEPTOR ASSIGNMENT HISTORY (#404.53) file incorrectly uses the
 file for its Kill logic. This caused the Kill logic to kill the same
 record that the Add logic was about to create, thus having no effect on
 updating the record.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 This Kill logic will be modified to use the "AD" cross-reference to
 correctly identify which record to remove.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process, it is
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes. Users do not have to be off the system.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: TEXT 
    PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu still displays the patch text
    only].
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
    select the Installation menu.
  
 3. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter SD*5.3*458)
    
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
       Global.
    d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*458.
  
 5. When prompted to 'Rebuild Menu Trees', respond NO. 
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
 8. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
    of order, enter the following:
  
    Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Reports [SD WAIT LIST REPORTS MENU]
    PCMM HL7 AND MAINTENANCE MENU [SCMC HL7 MENU]
