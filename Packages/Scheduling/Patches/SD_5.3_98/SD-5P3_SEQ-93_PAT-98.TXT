 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 Patches SD*5.3*41 and SD*5.3*48 must be installed prior to installing the 
 software in this patch.
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation
   will take less than 2 minutes.
  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu and 
       answer NO to the question 'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a 
       separate back-up message ?'.  Respond YES at the prompt 'Want to
       Continue with Load? YES//'.
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*98):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*98.
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Options?
       YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you
       would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
             SC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION          PCMM GUI Workstation
             SC PCMM REPORTS MENU             PCMM Reports
             SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S PATIENTS     Team's Patients
  
   7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
       to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate 
       CPUs.  Alternately, you can wait until the installation is
       complete and move the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY
       section to all systems.
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
       completion.
