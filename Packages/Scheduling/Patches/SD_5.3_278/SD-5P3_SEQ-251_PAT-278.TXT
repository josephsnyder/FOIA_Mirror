Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

                              ****  NOTE  ****
  
 Due to the national interest in VAMC capacity to care for veterans this 
 patch has a shortened installation compliance date. Installation of this 
 patch as soon as possible is necessary to meet deadlines which include 
 the upcoming release of SD*5.3*272 that will transmit the Direct Patient 
 Care hours via the PCMM HL7 transmission.
  
  
 This patch addresses two issues related to patch SD*5.3*264
  
 1. Preceptor Assignments not filing
    Patch SD*5.3*264 interfered with the saving of PCMM's Preceptor links.
    Following installation of SD*5.3*264, users received an error message
    and preceptor links were not saved after entering a new preceptor link.
    With installation of this patch, SD*5.3*278, the preceptor links will
    again be saved appropriately in file #404.53 -- PRECEPTOR ASSIGNMENT
    HISTORY FILE.
  
    The following NOIS calls reported this problem:
  
    RIC-1202-20985  Preceptor assignment was not updated  
    ELP-1202-71893  Preceptor Assignment was not updated
  
  
 2. This patch is accompanied by PCMM GUI version 1.2.3.1 to 
    correct a problem with the DIRECT PC FTEE GUI menu option and the PCMM
    Direct Primary Care FTEE report showing inactive primary care
    providers.  Following the installation of this patch, the GUI option
    and VISTA report will only display currently active primary care
    providers.  The Direct PC FTEE is stored in file #404.52--POSITION
    ASSIGNMENT HISTORY.
  
    The following NOIS calls reported this problem

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
  1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system and will take 
      less than 5 minutes. 
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time
  
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your system.
      You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global. On the KIDS
      menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
  
          Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
          Select INSTALL NAME: SD*5.3*278
                               ==========
  5. Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
  
  6. Do NOT inhibit users from login into the system.
  
  7.  Answer 'YES' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols?
         
      Disable the following options during installation
           
    SDAM APPT MGT                 Appointment Management
    SCMC PATIENT ASSIGN/UNASSIGN  Primary Care Team/Posn Assign or Unassign
    SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION     PCMM GUI WORKSTATION
  
  
  
  8. A post-installation subroutine POST278^SCMCTSK will run to
     update the PCMM CLIENT PATCH (#404.46) and  PCMM SERVER PATCH
     (#404.45) files so that running the GUI version (1.2.3.1) will be
     enabled.
  
  9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be  
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  10. The following software file is exported as part of this patch:
  
    File Name               Contents                      Retrieval Format
    ---------               --------                      ----------------
    SD_53_P278.ZIP File(s) indented below                  BINARY
     - PCMM.EXE            PCMM Executable
  
     NOTE: PCMM.EXE will replace the existing PCMM.EXE which is usually 
           found in the Program File/VISTA/PCMM directory of the client
           workstation.
  
           Workstations without an existing PCMM GUI application installed,
           will require a full client installation before PCMM.EXE is 
           installed. For workstations without an existing PCMM GUI, first
           download and run SD_53_P204.EXE to install the previous version
           of PCMM. Then the PCMM.exe file should be replaced with the new
           version.
  
    The file listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method
    is to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
    This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites
    may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
    follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
  11. If routines were removed from the map set in step #2, rebuild mapped
      routine(s).
