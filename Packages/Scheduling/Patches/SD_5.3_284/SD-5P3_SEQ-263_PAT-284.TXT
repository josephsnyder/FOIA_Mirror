Subject: Add Error Code '370M' to PCMM HL7 ERROR CODE (#404.472) File

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch address a missing error when listing the 'PCMM Transmission 
 Error Report'. Error message 370M -'Provider SSN invalid' will be added 
 to your error codes in the PCMM HL7 ERROR CODE (#404.472) File and will 
 now display on the report.
  
 It also addresses the inability to up-arrow ('^') out of the 'PCMM 
 Transmission Error Report' when abundant number of errors are displayed.
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 TAM-0103-30630   PCMM Transmission Errors
 LOM-0302-60746   PCMM TRANSMISSION ERROR REPORT EXIT FEATURE NOT WORKING
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ---------------------------- 
 TAM-0103-30630   PCMM Transmission Errors
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Users discovered a problem after receiving some 'PCMM Transmission Errors
 Received' messages sent from Austin.  These messages were displaying a
 total number of rejections, greater than the number of rejections listed
 on the 'PCMM Transmission Error Report'. Identifying these rejected
 entries through the PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION LOG (#404.471) File and HL7
 MESSAGE TEXT (#772) File revealed the discovery that the rejected code for
 'Provider with an invalid SSN', Error Code 370M, was not listed in the
 PCMM HL7 ERROR CODE (#404.472) File.  The report, 'PCMM Transmission Error
 Report' uses codes from this PCMM HL7 ERROR CODE file to display the error
 messages on the report.
  
 Resolution:  
 -----------
 This patch will add the new error code 370M into the PCMM HL7 ERROR CODE
 (#404.472) File and will display on the 'PCMM Transmission Error Report'.
  
  
 LOM-0302-60746  PCMM TRANSMISSION ERROR REPORT EXIT FEATURE NOT WORKING
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When pulling the 'PCMM Transmission Error Report' with abundant number of 
 errors to display, the prompt: "Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit:" 
 will not allow you to exit with an up-arrow ('^').
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Within the print section of the 'PCMM Transmission Error Report' there 
 was not an appropriate quit flag allowing the report to quit with an 
 up-arrow ('^').
