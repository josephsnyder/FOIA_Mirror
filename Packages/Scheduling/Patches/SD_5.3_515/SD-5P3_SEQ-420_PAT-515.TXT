  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
 VHA Handbook 1010.01, entitled TRANSITION ASSISTANCE AND CASE MANAGEMENT
 OF OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF) AND OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) 
 VETERANS, establishes procedures in the transition of care, coordination
 of services, care and case management of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)
 and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) active duty service members and 
 veterans by VHA and Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) staff.
  
 The Handbook also establishes nurse or social worker OIF-OEF Program
 and Case Manager positions at VA Medical Centers, and Transition Patient
 Advocate positions distributed to each Veterans Integrated Service
 Network (VISN) for placement in VA Medical Centers.
  
 It is critical for each VHA facility to have a process in place to 
 ensure that the care of all OIF and OEF service members and veterans is
 well-coordinated and that those who are severely-injured and/or ill 
 receive case management services from a nurse or social worker case
 manager.
  
 It is VHA policy that injured and/or ill OIF and OEF active duty service 
 members are transitioned seamlessly from MTFs to VHA facilities, that the
 care of all OIF and OEF service members and veterans treated at VHA
 facilities is coordinated, monitored, and tracked, that all OIF and OEF
 service members and veterans are screened for the need for case management
 services, and that severely-ill or injured OIF and OEF patients are case
 managed.
  
 In order to provide a mechanism for monitoring and tracking these patients,
 a new feature has been added in PCMM - the ability to create a non-Primary
 Care Team and Team Positions specifically for OIF and OEF Transition. Sites
 shall create an OIF OEF Transition Assistance team, create the associated
 team positions, assign the Transition Patient Advocate(s), OIF-OEF Program
 Manager, and OIF-OEF Case Managers to those positions, and then assign the
 OIF and/or OEF service members and veterans. 
  
 The information in PCMM related to the OIF/OEF Team will be transmitted to
 Austin in the same manner as Primary Care Team information is transmitted.
 This information will be monitored and tracked by the VSSC.
  
 Description of Changes:
 ----------------------
  
 Enhancements to PCMM have been made in order to accommodate the creation
 of the OIF OEF Transition Assistance team.
  
 The following new Team Purpose file entry has been created:
 OIF OEF

 OIF OEF CLINICAL CASE MANAGER
 OIF OEF PROGRAM MANAGER
 OIF OEF TRANSITION PATIENT ADVOCATE
  
 Changes have also been made to facilitate the transmission of the team,
 team position, OIF OEF team member and patient information.
