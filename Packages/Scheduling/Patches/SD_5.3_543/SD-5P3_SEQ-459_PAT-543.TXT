 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000273411 - Encounters not transmitting
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Patch DG*5.3*659, which was released in November 2006, added 3 new
    values to the Patient (#2) file, Radiation Exposure Method (#.3212)
    field, as follows:
  
           2        HIROSHIMA/NAGASAKI
           3        ATMOSPHERIC NUCLEAR TESTING
           4        H/N AND ATMOSPHERIC TESTING
           5        UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TESTING
           6        EXPOSURE AT NUCLEAR FACILITY
           7        OTHER
  
    The last 3 values (5, 6 and 7) were added with patch DG*5.3*659.
    However, at the time this patch was released, no coordination had been
    made to have the Ambulatory Care validation logic updated to allow
    encounters with one of these new values to transmit to Austin (NPCDB),
    thus they fail the validation logic for error code #7150 (Radiation
    Exposure Method is invalid or inconsistent with radiation exposure).
    Austin was not notified of the addition of these 3 new values at the
    time DG*5.3*659 was released either.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCMSVUT3 (Ambulatory Care validation logic) has been modified
    so that encounters containing any of the new Radiation Exposure Methods
    that were added to field (#.3212) in the Patient (#2) file will now be
    allowed to transmit to Austin (NPCDB).  Austin has also been notified 
    of these 3 new values and they have updated their system to allow 
    encounters to be accepted if they contain one of the 3 new values.
