Subject: CLINIC STOP FILE (#40.7) AUDIT & LOCKDOWN

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 **NOTE** Before installing this patch, check your P-MESSAGE-HFS
 device entry in the DEVICE file (#3.5) to make sure it exists and works.
  
 As part of the Fiscal Year (FY) 11 Decision Support System (DSS) updates,
 the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7) will be locked down.
  
 After installation of this patch, only entries related to "local" AMIS 
 REPORTING STOP CODES (field #1, file 40.7), will be editable.  The 
 following AMIS REPORTING STOP CODES are considered "local": 451-456,
 458-473, 475-479, and 482-485. 
  
 For these local entries, only the NAME (field #.01, file 40.7) field will
 be editable.  All other fields will be uneditable.
  
 A new option Edit Clinic Stop Code Name - Local Entries Only option [SD 
 EDIT LOCAL STOP CODE NAME] will be added to the Supervisor Menu [SDSUP]
 and will allow you to edit entries in the CLINIC STOP file that are
 considered local based on the AMIS REPORTING STOP CODE assigned to it, as
 described above.
  
 As part of the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file lock down, a check for entries
 with duplicate AMIS REPORTING STOP CODES (field #1, file #40.7) will be
 conducted.  If there are any duplicates that require user intervention, an
 email message will be sent to the holders of the ECXMGR and SD 
 SUPERVISOR keys as well as the CSPIMS mail group on FORUM for
 resolution.  If there are no entries to be updated, the users will receive
 an "all clear" email.
  
 In addition, a comparison will be made between the entries in the local
 CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file and a "gold" listing of CLINIC STOP entries.  Any
 entries missing from the local file will be added.  Any local entries that
 are not in the gold file will be inactivated.  Any differences between the
 local entries and the gold listing will cause the local entries to be 
 updated to match what's in the gold listing.  An email message detailing
 the updates completed during the review will also be sent to the holders
 of the ECXMGR and SD SUPERVISOR keys.
  
 The DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics Report [ECX CLN STOP REP] option
 will be queued to run in the background and any output will be sent to the
 holders of the ECXMGR and SD SUPERVISOR keys.
  
 The Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE REP] option 
 will be queued to run in the background and any output will be sent to the
 holders of the SD SUPERVISOR and ECXMGR keys.
  
 For both of the non-conforming reports, any entries identified as having 
 invalid/inactive stop codes should be updated to use active stop codes.  
 If you receive a "duplicates could not be resolved" message, please 
 contact ITM (formerly IRM) for assistance.
  
 Both of the non-conforming reports utilize the P-MESSAGE-HFS device to
 send the output to the appropriate recipients.  The reports will print
 even if there are no clinics to be updated.  
  
 **NOTE** If you do not receive the email messages as a result of the
 patch installation, it's possible there is a problem with your
 P-MESSAGE-HFS set up.  In that case, you'll need to run the reports
 manually (the option names are listed above). 
  
 This patch will also introduce a new option, Clinic Edit Log Report [SD
 CLINIC EDIT LOG], which will be placed on the Setup for DSS Clinic 
 Information [ECX SETUP CLINIC] menu.  This option will allow you to
 identify changes made to entries in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  
 This report will be sortable by USER NAME or by DATE CHANGED and will
 identify the field changed (each change is reported individually) and will
 include the old and new values as well as who made the change and which
 entry was changed.  This option may also be assigned as a standalone 
 option for Scheduling users, as needed.  As a result of adding auditing 
 to fields in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), the recompiling of the SDB 
 input template is required.  This will be done automatically as part of 
 the post-install tasks.
