This field contains the request number from the record tracking system.

It will only have a request number if the clinic requires records
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,3,0)

parent request may then, in turn, indicate that more than one record 
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,8,0)
request is associated with this appointment. For example, if the patient's
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,9,0)
medical record has two volumes then there maybe a request issued for each
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,10,0)
volume.
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,11,0)
 
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,12,0)
The request for volume 1 maybe the initial(parent) request and the
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,13,0)
request for the second volume would have volumes 1's request as its
"^DD",44,44.003,200,21,14,0)
