Subject: PCMM INACTIVATION MODIFICATIONS AND FIXES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following PCMM modifications to the patient
 inactivation functionality:
  
  The original request for automatic unassignments (inactivation logic) used
  the time frame described in VHA Directive 2003-063. New patients had to
  be automatically unassigned if there was no encounter activity with
  assigned PCP within 12 months of assignment; established patients had to
  be un-assigned after 24 months of inactivity w/PCP.
  
   -  The inactivation logic put into effect by this patch now includes 11 
      months for flagging new patients (23 months for established patients)
      + 7 days, and respectively 12 months for inactivation for new patients
      (24 months for established patients) +7 days. 
      
      Note: The current schedule for automatic inactivation processing on
            the 15th and last day of each month will remain the same.
            The inactivation date, calculated based on the flagging date
            can therefore be either the 15th or the last day of the month but
            the difference between the flagging date and the inactivation date
            cannot be less than 30 days. 
  
   -  Existing inactivation code that included checking for the patch
      SD*5.3*297 installation date will be removed.
  
   -  Currently patients are flagged only on the last day of a month if
      the SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK is running.
  
      After installing this patch, the flagging process will be executed each
      time this process is running. If SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK is scheduled
      daily as required, the flagging for inactivation will be done daily.
      The "Patient Scheduled for Inactivation from Primary Care Panel"
      message will be sent to the PCMM PATIENT/PROVIDER INACTIVE Mail Group
      each time if at least one patient is flagged on that run date.
      
   -  Currently the flagged patients are not un-flagged before the calculated
      inactivation date if a valid encounter has been kept since the
      flagging date.
      
      After installing this patch, flagged patients will be verified for
      un-flagging and un-flagged with each run, if applicable, and not only
      on the day when the inactivation process takes place.
  
   -  Currently patients assigned to a position with more than one
      PCP assigned to it in the past are excluded from verification
      for inactivation.
  
      After installing this patch, patient encounters will be verified
      against all providers assigned to a position, if any, within the
      identified range of dates the provider was assigned to the position.
  
   -  Determination if messages for the 15th and the last day of a month 
      have to be sent, will be done on the day the SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK
      started and not on the current computer date which can go past
      midnight to the next date. Option SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK was modified
      to include both ENTRY and EXIT actions to keep a temporary record of
      starting and ending this process.
   
   -  Verification of previously flagged providers will be implemented by
      replacing code references to a non existing "AFLG" cross-reference in
      the Position Assignment History file (# 404.52) with references to
      the correct "AFLAG" cross-reference.
      Time-sensitive verification of the POSSIBLE PRIMARY PRACTITIONER? 
      (#.04) field in file 404.57 will be included in the logic for
      possible un-flagging of previously flagged providers for
      inactivation.
   
   -  Inactivation routines will be modified to eliminate an error when
      executing option SCMC INACTIVATED 30.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
    1)  HD0000000188405 PRIMARY CARE STAFF SCHEDULED FOR INACTIVATION Problem
  
    Problem:
    ========
    After installation of patch SD*5.3*297 the SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK started
    flagging providers for inactivation if they did not match defined criteria.
    After correction, the flagged providers were still listed as flagged for
    inactivation. The problem was caused by coding in routine SCMCTSK3 where
    flagged providers were identified for possible un-flagging by scanning
    cross-reference "AFLG" of the POSITION ASSIGNMENT HISTORY FILE (# 404.52)
    while that cross-reference should have been "AFLAG" instead.
    Cross-reference "AFLG" does not exist in file 404.52. Additionally that
    verification code does not check for the current status of the POSSIBLE
    PRIMARY PRACTITIONER? field (# .04) of the TEAM POSITION file (# 404.57)
    to determine if it might have changed since the provider was flagged.
    
    Solution:
    =========
  
    Routine SCMCTSK3 was modified by:
    - implementing correct "AFLAG" cross-reference
    - including code for time sensitive verification of the POSSIBLE PRIMARY
      PRACTITIONER? field
    The indicated changes allow for correct un-flagging of already flagged
    providers for inactivation, if any. 
                              
    2)  HD0000000189293 Not receiving all messages
  
    Problem:
    ========
  
    Many sites reported that they were not receiving inactivation messages
    generated by the SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK as expected, e.g. on the 15th and
    the last day of each month. Those messages were occasionally missing,
    mostly on the last day of a month. This was caused by determining whether
    to send messages based on current computer date rather than the start
    date of the task. If the task was scheduled late in the night, and
    continued past midnight, the current system date at the time the decision
    was made did not match criteria for sending messages, and the users
    did not receive them.
  
    Solution:
    =========
  
    Routines SCMCTSK1 and SCMCTSK2 were modified to execute activities
    to be performed on the 15th and on the last day of a month based on the
    the date when the task started running, and not on current computer date.
    Therefore, after this patch is installed, even if this job runs through
    midnight to the following day, the task start day will determine what
    action has to be taken.
    Option SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK was modified to include both an ENTRY
    and EXIT Action to keep a temporary record of starting and ending this
    process. The result of those actions can be seen in the example below:
  
    ^XTMP global has the standard structure with the third piece of the top
    level ^XTMP("SCMCTSK2-3080212",0) representing the job number ($J)
    of the last run of the SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK that started on
    Feb. 12th 2008 (3080212).
  
    Both "START" and "STOP" nodes apply to the same $J showing respectively
    date and time of starting and ending the process. The last process
    ($J=541175997) was scheduled before midnight, and finished on the next day.
  
 ^XTMP("SCMCTSK2-3080212",0)=3080219^3080212^541175997
  
 ^XTMP("SCMCTSK2-3080212",541161730,"START")=Feb 12, 2008@14:15:14
                                     "STOP")=Feb 12, 2008@14:21:37
 ^XTMP("SCMCTSK2-3080212",541162563,"START")=Feb 12, 2008@12:40:03
                                     "STOP")=Feb 12, 2008@12:47:17
  
 ^XTMP("SCMCTSK2-3080212",541175997,"START")=Feb 12, 2008@23:58:02
                                     "STOP")=Feb 13, 2008@00:05:02  
  
    3)  HD0000000216693 Multiple providers on a PCMM position not
                        evaluated as expected.
    Problem:
    ========
    The existing logic to identify all providers assigned to the Primary
    Care Position for evaluation of encounters within a given period of time
    does not work correctly, and only the latest provider is evaluated.
    Only providers who were on a team for entire date range are evaluated.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Subroutine SEEN^SCMCTSK1 was modified to properly identify all
    providers assigned to a particular position. In this way any encounter
    kept for any of those providers, within their activity on the position,
    would count.
    The following rules apply:
    - The same provider can be assigned, unassigned, assigned again etc. and
    several segments of a local array are created for the same provider,
    if assigned more than once.
    - If a patient is assigned to PC position, and a provider assigned to
    that position has a preceptor then all encounters for that patient
    have to be matched with both the provider (preceptee) from the PC
    position the patient is assigned to, and with the preceptor provider as
    well. The range of days to be evaluated for the preceptor, if any, will
    be the same as identified for the PC provider.
   - If a patient is assigned to the PC preceptor position then only the
   provider(s) assigned to that position is(are) evaluated. The preceptor
   can have multiple preceptees assigned to the related positions but it is
   not realistic to evaluate all of them, and there has never been
   intention to do so.
  
    4)  HD0000000216683 Patients with appointments are not un-flagged
                        from inactivation before the inactivation date.
     Problem:
    =========
     Patients flagged for inactivation have 30 days to be inactivated and if 
     messages are generated on the 15th or on the last day of a month they
     include all flagged patients even if the flagged patient had an
     encounter since the flagging date.  
  
    Solution:
   ==========
    The existing condition not to look for encounters in flagged patients 
    until the inactivation date occurs was modified to eliminate those
    patients from being included into messages, and those entries will be 
    immediately un-flagged.
  
    5)  HD0000000174422 Error when running the SCMC INACTIVATED 30 option
  
    Problem:
   =========
    Getting the error <UNDEFINED>IN30+5^SCMCTSK2 when running the SCMC 
    INACTIVATED 30 option. This error is caused by "Newing" or resetting
    the DIPA variable making it undefined when it's time to be used.
  
    Select OPTION NAME:  SCMC INACTIVATED 30  Patients Inactivated from
    PCP Panels in past month
    Start with Institution: FIRST// 
    
    S FLDS="[SCMC INACTIVATED]",FR="T-31,,"_$TR(DIPA("SI"),",","
    "),TO="T,,"_$TR(DI^PA("EI")_"z",","," ")
    <UNDEFINED>IN30+5^SCMCTSK2
   
    Solution:
   ==========
    Two routines SCMCTSK1 and SCMCTSK2 were modified to call the required
    parameters for integrity of data. Subroutine IN30^SCMCTSK2 was modified
    to call SORT^SCMCTSK1(.DIPA,.SDD).
     
    6)  HD0000000222257 Scheduled for inactivation report is a two
                                 reams of paper.
    Problem:
   =========
    On the last day of a month the inactivation software calculates the
    number of days since installation of patch SD*5.3*297. If that number
    is greater than 330 then a patient's encounters are checked only for
    the last 11 months. Nov 30 2007 was the first time that number was
    greater than 330. Based on this condition entries in the Patient Team
    Position Assignment file (# 404.43) were flagged if there was no
    encounter for the last 11 months. At the same time a temporary global
    was created for the flagged entry. This process continues by scanning
    all flagged entries, including those that have just been flagged.
    This time a different condition determines if the flagged patient was
    seen or not, and incorrectly flagged patients are un-flagged but
    without removing the accompanying temporary global created before.
    At the end of this process messages are generated from the indicated
    temporary Globals, listing some patients that have already been
    un-flagged, and creating 'False' and longer reports.
  
    Solution:
   ==========
    The flagging for inactivation logic is corrected as follows:
  
    Step 1: Determine if the patient is new or established based on the
    length of time the patient has been assigned to the PCP position. If
    assigned to the position 12 months or less then NEW. If assigned to the
    position more than 12 months then ESTABLISHED.
  
    Step 2: If patient is NEW and it is the 11th month since being assigned
    to the position check to see if the patient has any prior encounters
    with the PCP/APs in the preceding 11 months + 7 days and if no
    encounters then flag for inactivation. Note that the look back should
    be for an encounter with any person that occupied the PCP/AP positions
    in the past 11 months + 7 days.
    On month 12, if still no encounters with PCP/AP in the preceding
    12 months + 7  days then inactivate. The 7 days time period will take
    into account that many times the provider sees the patient and then a
    day or two later assigns them to their panel.
  
    Step 3: If patient is ESTABLISHED then check to see if the patient has
    had any prior encounters with the PCP/AP in the preceding 23 months +  
    7 days and if no encounters flag for inactivation.  On month 24, if
    still no encounters with PCP/AP in the preceding 24 months + 7 days
    then inactivate. Again, check for encounters with any persons that
    occupied the PCP/AP positions in the last 24 months + 7 days.
  
 Note: Inactivation will take place either on the 15th or last day of the month
       immediately after the calculated inactivation.
      
      Flagging and un-flagging patients for inactivation will take place each 
      time SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK is running, and if any patients are
      flagged then in addition to the current email messaging
      functionality, a message with the Subject line "Patient Scheduled for
      Inactivation from Primary Care Panel" will be sent to the PCMM
      PATIENT/PROVIDER INACTIVE Mail Group.
  
    7)  HD0000000225100 Task inactivating patients that should be
                                 active.
  
   Problem:
   ========
   Portland reported that many patients were inactivated incorrectly on their
   last PCMM NIGHTLY job of Dec 15th 2007. It has been determined that the
   SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK not only flags incorrectly but also does not
   remove entries from being incorrectly flagged. That situation did not
   happen before because only recently the un-flag evaluation logic took
   into consideration the date of installation of patch SD*5.3*297. If
   that date is older than 365 days since the run date of the task, the
   current logic forces all flagged entries, including established
   patients, to be checked for encounters in the last 12 months.
  
   In the following code in routine SCMCTSK2:
  
          ..S SC297=$$PDAT^SCMCGU("SD*5.3*297")
          ..N NEW S NEW=$S($P(ZERO,U,3)<SC297:0,1:1)   ;D D^%DTC S NEW=$S(X>330:0
             ,1:1)
          ..S X1=DT,X2=SC297 D D^%DTC S SC297=X
          ..S X="T-"_$S(SC297>365:"11M",NEW:"11M",1:"23M") D ^%DT S TYDT=+Y D SEE
             N^SCMCTSK1 I $G(SEEN) D UNFLG Q 
          ..S X="T-"_$S(SC297>365:"12M",NEW:"12M",1:"24M") D ^%DT S TYDT=+Y D SEE
             N^SCMCTSK1 I $G(SEEN) D:(DATE>ENDDT) UNFLG Q
  
   $S function determines either 11M or 12M to be a valid result if SC297
   is greater than 365.
  
   In Portland patch SD*5.3*297 was installed on 3061006.082157, which
   explains why Portland experienced this problem before other sites that
   installed that patch later, usually in January 2007.
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The inactivation logic will not include evaluation based on patch SD*5.3*297 
  installation date. It will follow steps listed in problem/solution 6.
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ======================== 
 The updated PCMM User Manual will be posted to the VDL immediately after 
 the release of this patch.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 Users can be on the system during the installation of this patch but 
 because some options will be out of order, it is recommended that it be 
 installed in off-peak hours.   
  
 It is required that the installation be monitored for possible actions 
 to be performed thereafter, (see below). Installation should not be queued
 and the post-install messages must be reviewed and followed up.
  
 Once the patch is installed, the currently flagged patient list will be
 scrubbed to allow for new logic to be applied.
   
 The patch post-install will then flag patients following a new logic and
 the following message will be sent to the PCMM PATIENT/PROVIDER INACTIVE
 Mail Group and to the installer:

  team assignments and flags them for inactivation if their assignment is NEW
  and they have not been seen in the last year. It also flags ESTABLISHED
  patients if they have not been seen more than two years. If there are not 
  appointments within 30 days since flagging the related patients are 
  inactivated on the closest 15th or the end of month process. Messages are 
  generated both on the 15th and on the last day of a month.
