Subject: PCMM - DISPLAY SSN IF NO PID

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 If a patient has no eligibility assigned, the SSN does not display 
 during patient assignment (Patient|Patient Assignment) in the Primary 
 Care Management Module (PCMM)'s client software.
  
 The SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) field of the PATIENT (#2) File should 
 be used if the PRIMARY LONG ID (#.363) field of the Patient file does 
 not exist.  For veterans, the PID field is the same as the SSN field.  
  
 The PID field gets created when the PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY CODE (#.361) 
 field of the Patient file is entered.  When doing a patient look up in 
 PCMM's client software, the SSN is not displayed if the PID does not 
 exist.  With the changes to SCUTBK11, on the 'Patient Lookup' screen, 
 the SSN will be displayed to identify patients if no PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY 
 assigned (and therefore no PID).
  
 Note: On the 'Select Patient Team Assignment' screen (which follows the 
 'Patient Lookup' screen), the SSN will NOT be displayed in the above 
 circumstance when PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY has not been assigned.  The fix to 
 the 'Select Patient Team Assignment' screen will occur in a future patch 
 to the client software which will require an updated PCMM.EXE file be 
 installed on the user's workstation.
  
 This issue was addressed in NOIS DUB-1296-31487.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  Note: SD*5.3*86 must be installed prior to loading this patch.
  
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation
  will take less than 2 minutes.
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu and 
      answer NO to the question 'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a 
      separate back-up message ?'.  Respond YES at the prompt 'Want to
      Continue with Load? YES//'.
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*86):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
          (routines,DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*86.
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Options?
      YES//',respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you would 
      like to place out of order, enter the following: 
            SC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION          PCMM GUI Workstation
  7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
      to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate 
      CPUs.  Alternately, you can wait until the installation is complete 
      and move the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section 
      to all systems.
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
