  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  1. HD0000000063567 CPH-0703-42363  COMPUTED FIELDS NOT PRINTING
  
   Problem:
   ========
   When using Fileman option Print File Entries and printing out a 
   computed date field using fields in the TEAM POSITION file (#404.57)
   the year will not print out. 
  
   For example the TEAM POSITION file (#404.57) has the computed fields
   CURRENT EFFECTIVE DATE (#301), CURRENT ACTIVATION DATE (#302), CURRENT
   INACTIVATION DATE (#303). When you do a print and use captioned output
   the complete date does not print.
  
  Select OPTION: PRINT FILE ENTRIES  
  
  OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: OPTION//  TEAM POSITION              (162 entries)
  SORT BY: POSITION// 
  START WITH POSITION: FIRST// 
  FIRST PRINT FIELD: .01  POSITION
  THEN PRINT FIELD: 301  CURRENT EFFECTIVE DATE
  THEN PRINT FIELD: 302  CURRENT ACTIVATION DATE
  THEN PRINT FIELD: 303  CURRENT INACTIVATION DATE
  THEN PRINT FIELD: 
  Heading (S/C): TEAM POSITION LIST//

  ED NURSE PRACT                  JUN 09,    JUN 09,     
    
   Solution:
   =========
   Field lengths have been changed from 8 to 12 in the following fields 
   for Team Positions file (#404.57):
  
   CURRENT EFFECTIVE DATE    (#301)
   CURRENT ACTIVATION DATE   (#302)
   CURRENT INACTIVATION DATE (#303)
  
  The print will now show the entire date:
  Select OPTION: PRINT FILE ENTRIES  
  
  OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: TEAM POSITION// 
  SORT BY: POSITION// 
  START WITH POSITION: FIRST// 
  FIRST PRINT FIELD: .01  POSITION
  THEN PRINT FIELD: 301  CURRENT EFFECTIVE DATE
  THEN PRINT FIELD: 302  CURRENT ACTIVATION DATE
  THEN PRINT FIELD: 303  CURRENT INACTIVATION DATE

   2. HD0000000246171 Detailed Patient Assignments Listing 
    
   Problem:
   ========
   While testing the reports fixed in SD*5.3*520 we found that the   
   Detailed Patient Assignments report [SC PCMM DETAIL LIST PTS] only
   chooses patients with active clinic enrollments. This is in the option
   DPA Detailed Patient Assignments [SC PCMM DETAIL LIST PTS].
   This report option was temporarily turned off for SD*5.3*520 and while 
   looking through the code we realized the report contained the same
   information needed by users that is contained in the TEAM PATIENT
   LISTING [SC PCMM LIST TEAM'S PATIENTS] report.
    
   Solution:
   =========
   This option DPA Detailed Patient Assignments [SC PCMM DETAIL LIST PTS]
   is being turned off as obsolete after confirmation from PCMM user group.
   The Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) User manual has been updated
   to reflect the changes.
   
   3. HD0000000265293 Report printout problem
    
   Problem:
   ========
   Practitioner's Patients [SC PCMM PRACT PATIENTS] report prints the
   header only on the first page and prints the report data without a
   header on the remaining pages. We have found that a position having only
   one associated clinic will not print a header for each page.
   
   Solution:
   =========
   Routine SCRPPAT3 was changed so that a header will print for 
   positions that have any amount of associated clinics assigned to them.
   
  4. HD0000000246234 Roll and scroll problem with PCMM enrollment
   
   Problem:
   =======
   When assigning or changing team assignments, PCMM prompts for patients 
   enrollment to a clinic. The user always accepts the defaults in the roll
   and scroll for action PC  PCMM Assign or Unassign in the Appointment
   Management [SDAM APPT MGT] option including the question about enrolling
   the patient in the associated clinic.  
   
   Solution:
   ========= 
   Since clinic enrollment is no longer used, routine SCMCQK1 has been 
   changed so that the prompt for clinic enrollment, when utilizing the
   option PCMM Assign or Unassign option in Appointment Management [SDAM 
   APPT MGT], will not appear when assigning or reassigning patients to a
   new team.
