Subject: SC Veterans Awaiting Appointments

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 In support of the need to prioritize the provision of outpatient care to 
 service connected veterans, this patch distributes a new report designed 
 to return data related to a) service connected veterans that have been 
 entered into VistA but have not been provided an appointment; and b) 
 service connected veterans with future appointments greater than 30 days 
 beyond the 'desired date' defined for those appointments.
  
 The report output includes name, SSN, primary eligibility, date entered, 
 address and phone number.  For those patients rated 0-50% SC, the rated 
 service connected disabilities are displayed.  In the report format 
 related to future appointments greater than 30 days beyond the 'desired 
 date', the appointments that meet this criteria are also included.
  
  
 New Option
 ==========
  
 This patch contains a new option, 'SC Veterans Awaiting Appointments' 
 [SCRPW SC VETS AWAITING APPTS] designed to produce the report formats 
 described above.  With the installation of this patch this option will be 
 placed on the existing 'ACRP Reports Menu' [SCRPW ACRP REPORTS MENU].

 Installation instructions:
 ==========================
  
 NOTE:  This software is released as an emergency patch at the request of 
 VHA Headquarters in coordination with policy and implementation 
 instructions to be distributed shortly.  It contains new software and may
 be installed out of patch installation sequence without adversely
 affecting existing software.
  
 This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation will
 take less than one minute.
  
 1. All routines contained in this patch are new.  However, if any of the
    routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*267).
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
        backup any of the other changes.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
        installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines and
        options).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
        you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
    SD*5.3*267.
  
 6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
    Install? YES//" it is recommended that you answer "NO".  The option
    contained in this patch will be included in user up-arrow "^" jump
    functionality when routine site menu tree rebuilding is performed.
  
    If you elect to answer "YES" to this prompt, completing the
    installation of this patch may take significantly longer than the
    estimate provided.
  
 7. When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    YES//' answer NO.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 9. If any routines were unmapped as a part of step 1, they should be
    returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
    completion.
