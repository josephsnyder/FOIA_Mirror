Subject: VA-TERATOGENIC MEDICATION ORDER CHECK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Teratogenic Medications Order Check Interim Solution was originally 
 released as VistA patch PXRM*2*22 in July 2012.  The interim solution is 
 intended to have regular updates for clinical content, primarily to add 
 newly approved medications with FDA Pregnancy Categories that warrant an 
 order check.  This patch, PXRM*2*34, represents the first such update.  
 Included in this update are new medications, order check text changes 
 consistent with the Notification of Teratogenic Medications project, 
 support for reversal of tubal ligations, and updates to the taxonomies 
 that define a women's medical inability to conceive a pregnancy.
  
 This patch also includes an update to a single dialog element for the 
 Epilepsy Initial note that was released with PXRM*2.0*30.  That element 
 had a mapped Health Factor Category, instead of a mapped Health Factor.  
 This element updates that mapped item.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1.  INC000000881972 - VA-Teratogenic Medication Order Check Update
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Teratogenic Medications Order Check Interim Solution was originally 
 released as VistA patch PXRM*2*22 in July 2012.  The interim solution is 
 intended to have regular updates for clinical content, primarily to add 
 newly approved medication with FDA Pregnancy Categories that warrant an
 order check.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch, PXRM*2*34, represents the first such update.  Two routines are
 included with this patch, PXRMP34E and PXRMP34I. They are init tasks that
 add new entries to the REMINDER EXCHANGE (#811.8) file and the contents 
 of these entries are installed during the post-init.  These routines can
 be deleted after the install.
 Included in this update are new medication, order check text changes
 consistent with the Notification of Teratogenic Medication project,
 support for reversal of tubal ligations, and updates to the taxonomies
 that define a women's medical inability to conceive a pregnancy.
  
 Please refer to PXRM_2_0_34_IG.pdf for more detail concerning these 
 clinical reminders.
