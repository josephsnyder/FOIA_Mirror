  - Routine

Description:
============

 The VA Hospice and Palliative Care (HPC) program office has sponsored the 
 development of this reminder dialog template to document provider-based 
 palliative care consultations at all sites within VHA. This template is 
 critical to improving the process and documentation of clinical care, and 
 facilitating high quality palliative care and programmatic quality 
 improvement. It is the intent of the HPC program office that this national
 template be formally distributed to VA palliative care programs for
 voluntary use throughout VHA in early 2014.
  
 The current version of the template, PC-NCT 3.0, for national 
 distribution, was developed by the Quality Improvement Resource Center 
 (QuIRC), based in Los Angeles, CA. QuIRC serves as one of three national 
 Quality Centers that support the HPC's Comprehensive End-of-Life Care 
 Initiative to foster quality improvement. QuIRC built the template based 
 on a comprehensive review of the literature and in consultation with a 
 wide variety of program stakeholders and clinical experts. There has been 
 extensive involvement from the field in order to obtain concurrence and 
 refine earlier versions. Our program office goal is to have at least 60% 
 of the VA facilities adopt the PC-NCT over the next two years.
  
 Using an earlier version of PC-NCT in 2010, QuIRC gauged interest from 
 facilities about participating in a User Community in order to pilot the 
 template in a clinical setting; garnered feedback regarding the content, 
 ease of use, and utility of the tool; and assessed surrounding the tool's 
 adoption and implementation.  After identifying facilities interested in 
 piloting the tool, QuIRC selected five sites (Baltimore, Battle Creek, 
 Indianapolis, Birmingham, and Salt Lake) to make up the User Community 
 based on geographic diversity, palliative care program size and 
 complexity, academic and non-academic status, and the local availability 
 of evaluation resources.  The PC-NCT was disseminated to the User 
 Community sites in August 2010.  User Community conference calls have 
 been held at least once per month in which we gather valuable feedback to 
 make ongoing modifications which are reflected in the PC-NCT version 
 3.0.  This most recent version captures aspects of care that are most 
 important to assess during a palliative care consultation in a manner 
 that is efficient and helpful to clinicians.
  
 In order for the HPC performance measure to be met for a given palliative 
 care consult, four elements must be present - primary diagnosis, CPT code 
 (ending in 3, 4, or 5), qualified provider (MD/DO, CNS, NP, PA) and 
 correct DSS code (351 or 353).  For this to occur for an inpatient, the 
 CPRS location of the patient MUST be changed to an outpatient clinic 
 location setup for this purpose PRIOR to beginning the note. The reminder 
 dialog itself has a "change location?" prompt built in.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1.  INC000000778314 - Palliative Care National Clinical Template (PC-NCT)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Hospice and Palliative Care (HPC) program office has developed this 
 reminder dialog template to document provider-based palliative care 
 consultations at all sites within VHA.  This template is critical to 
 improving the process and documentation of clinical care, and 
 facilitating high quality palliative care and programmatic quality 
 improvement.  It is the intent of the HPC program office that this 
 national template be formally distributed to VA palliative care programs 
 for voluntary use throughout VHA beginning FY2013.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Hospice and Palliatve Care (HPC) Care Reminder dialog template was 
 created. This patch, PXRM*2*31, contains two routines, PXRMP31E and 
 PXRMP31I. They are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER
 EXCHANGE (#811.8) file and the contents of these entries are installed
 during the post-init.  These routines can be deleted after the install.
 There are two Reminder Exchange entries that will be installed as part of
 this patch.
