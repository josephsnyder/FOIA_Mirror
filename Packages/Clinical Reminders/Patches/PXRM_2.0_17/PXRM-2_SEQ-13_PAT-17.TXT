 General Overview:
 =================
 This build is a multi-package build that contains USR*1.0*33 and
 PXRM*2.0*17.
 
 PXRM*2*17:
 The primary purpose of this patch is to update the national
 polytrauma reminder. Additionally multiple national reminder
 components are updated. The Exchange file entries installed by this
 patch are:
 
  VA-AAA SCREENING
  VA-PTSD REASSESSMENT (PCL)
  VA-POLYTRAUMA MARKER
  VA-BL DEPRESSION SCREEN
  VA-HF ETOH SELF SCORE AUD 10
  VA-EMBEDDED FRAGMENTS RISK EVALUATION
  VA-GP EF CONTACT INFORMATION
  VA-GP ALC ADVICE2
  VA-MH STOP CODES FOR PTSD EVALUATION
  VA-HF ACUTE ILLNESS EVAL
  DEPRESSION/PTSD REMINDER TERM UPDATES - PATCH 17
  PXRM*2*17 COMPUTED FINDINGS
 
 See the Installation Guide, PXRM_2_17_IG.PDF, for complete details
 and instructions for installing these Exchange file entries. During
 the install you may be prompted for replacement items. Because of
 this the patch should not be queued and the site's Clinical
 Reminders manager should be on hand during the install.
 
 In addition the following changes are made.
 
 Reminder Computed Findings:
 Three national computed findings are included:
 
 VA-ASU USER CLASS (new )
 VA-WAS INPATIENT (new)
 VA-ACTIVE PATIENT RECORD FLAGS (new)
 
 See the Installation Guide, PXRM_2_17_IG.PDF, or the online
 descriptions for details on how to use these computed findings.
 
 Reminder Evaluation:
 The resolution date calculation was not correct when the resolution
 logic contained a "NOT". In those cases where the resolution logic
 evaluated to true, the resolution date was calculated to be 0. This
 was corrected so that the resolution date will no longer be
 calculated as 0.
 
 The Clinical Maintenance output was not displaying the resolution
 finding header when the resolution logic evaluated to false, but one
 or more of the resolution findings was true. This was corrected.
 
 There was a bug in the display of drug findings; for multiple drug
 findings in a term, only one occurrence of each finding type was
 displaying. This was corrected.
 
 Other problems were reported with the display of drug findings. A
 complete fix of this pre-exisiting problem will require more time
 and testing than we have available for this patch, so a complete
 solution will have to come in a future patch. Nevertheless, one
 problem was rectified: The output was not consistent across
 inpatient, outpatient, and non-VA meds. The output was changed so
 that it is as consistent as possible (there are some fields that
 apply only to outpatient and some that apply only to non-VA.)
 
 A bug was reported where a non-CH lab test would not work when used
 as a term finding, but would work when used as a definition finding.
 This is corrected.
 
 A problem with an incorrect resolution date calculation for a
 resolution logic string containing a 'FF was corrected.
 
 Reminder Reports:
 Patch PXRM*2*12 added the new field OWNER to reminder report
 templates. E3R 20277 requested including this field when displaying
 the details of the template. This functionality has been added. If
 an owner is defined, the template will list the owner name. If an
 owner is not defined, the template will display "None" next to the
 owner field.
 
 Remedy ticket 372679 reported a bug where the Reminders Due Report
 was not producing any output when the selected output device was a
 host file. This was found to be the case at some, but not all sites.
 The reason for this is that sites can name a host file device
 anything they want and the report was expecting a certain set of
 names. The solution was to use the type instead of the name, because
 types are standardized.
 
 Reminder Sponsor:
 The following Sponsors are renamed:
  Mental Health and Behavioral Science Strategic Group 
   to
  Office of Mental Health Services
 
  Mental Health and Behavioral Science Strategic Group and Women
  Veterans  Health  Program 
   to
  Office of Mental Health Services and Women Veterans Health Program
 
 Reminder Taxonomies:
 A new option, PXRM TAXONOMY CODE SEARCH, has been added to the
 TAXONOMY MANAGEMENT MENU. This option will let the user input a code
 and then it will search all taxonomies in the account and list those
 where it is used.
 
 Miscellaneous:
 The mechanism used by the Clinical Reminders package to deliver
 MailMan messages was changed to make it more flexible.
 
 When PXRM*2.0*17 is installed in a test account, a MailMan message
 containing the value of ORQQPX NEW REMINDER PARAMS will be sent to
 the Clinical Reminders mail group. When the installation is done in
 a production account, the message will be sent to a Forum mail
 group.
 
 A problem with the MST History file not updating after recording one
 of the MST health factors was reported; Remedy ticket #367613. A fix
 for this problem is included and the post-init will start an MST
 synchronization job to ensure that the MST History file is
 up-to-date.
 
 USR*1*33
 This patch changes displays of User Class Names in Authorization and  
 Subscription Utility (ASU) options. User Class Names are now shown
 by the name of the entry in the User Class File (File #8930). 
 Previously, they were shown by their display names. In particular,
 the User Class Definition Option [USR CLASS DEFINITION] has been
 changed to show the entry name of the User Class.
   
 The User Class Definition Option [USR CLASS DEFINITION] is found
 under the User Class Management Menu [USR CLASS MANAGEMENT MENU],
 which is found under the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE
 MENU].
   
 In addition, the module used to list the User Classes a particular
 user belongs to has been enhanced. It may now be set to list classes
 by entry name rather than by display name, if desired.
 These changes are necessary because it is the entry name of the
 Class that users see in User Class edits and various ASU modules.
 Using the same name in displays avoids confusion.

  Documentation:
  ==============
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites
 may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 This documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.

  ==========
 This is a multi-package build, consequently it will be available
 only as a host file. The name of the file is POLYTRAUMA_MARKER.KID.
  
 Sites will retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.  The
 preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.  This
 transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also
 elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:

 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take
 between 5 and 15 minutes. A number of Clinical Reminders Exchange
 entries will be installed and the installer may be prompted for
 replacement items. Because of this the patch should not be queued
 and the site's Clinical Reminders manager should be on hand during
 the install.
 
 1. Use the 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS installation menu.
    When prompted to enter a host file type in [DIR]:POLYTRAUMA_MARKER.KID,
    where [DIR] is the local directory where you have stored the host file.
 
 2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options, as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
 
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (POLYTRAUMA MARKER 1.0)
 
 4. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install?
    NO// respond 'NO'.
 
 5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,"
    respond 'NO'.
 
 6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO// respond 'NO'.
 
 7. The init routines PXRMP17E and PXRMP17I may be deleted once the
    installation has completed.
