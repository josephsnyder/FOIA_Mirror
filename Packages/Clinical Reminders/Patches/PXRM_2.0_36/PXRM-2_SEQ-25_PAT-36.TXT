 PCV13 (Pneumococcal Conjugate) Vaccine Recommendations
 ======================================================
  
 For Adults with no Previous Pneumococcal Vaccinations: 
 ------------------------------------------------------
 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that 
 adults 19 years of age or older with immunocompromising conditions, 
 functional or anatomic asplenia, CSF leaks, or cochlear implants, and who 
 have not previously received PCV13 or PPSV23, should receive a dose of 
 PCV13 first followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later. 
 Subsequent doses of PPSV23 should follow current PPSV23 recommendations 
 for high risk adults. Specifically, a second PPSV23 dose is recommended 5 
 years after the first PPSV23 dose for persons aged 19 through 64 years 
 with functional or anatomic asplenia and for persons with 
 immunocompromising conditions. A second dose of PPSV23 is not recommended 
 for persons 19 through 64 years of age with cochlear implants or CSF 
 leaks. Additionally, those who received one or more doses of PPSV23 
 before age 65 years for any indication should receive another dose of the 
 vaccine at age 65 years or older if at least 5 years have elapsed since 
 their previous PPSV23 dose. If a dose of PPSV23 was received at age 65 
 years or later, no additional doses of PPSV23 are recommended.
    
 For Adults with Previous Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccinations:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adults 19 years of age or older with the aforementioned conditions 
 (functional or anatomic asplenia, immunocompromising conditions, or those 
 with CSF leaks or cochlear implants) who have previously received one or 
 more doses of PPSV23 should be given a dose of PCV13 one or more years 
 after the last PPSV23 dose was received. For those who require additional 
 doses of PPSV23, the first such dose should be given no sooner than 8 
 weeks after PCV13 and at least 5 years since the most recent dose of 
 PPSV23.

 1. INC000000894115 - PCV13 (Pneumococcal Conjugate) Vaccine 
                      Recommendations 
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Centers for Disease 
 Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued recommendations for PCV13 
 (Pneumococcal Conjugate) Vaccine.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 This patch, PXRM*2*36, contains two routines, PXRMP36E and PXRMP36I. They 
 are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER EXCHANGE (#811.8) 
 file and the contents of these entries are installed during the 
 post-init.  These routines can be deleted after the install. They perform 
 the following during installation:
  
    1. Installation Routine:
    Rename PNEUMOVAX to PNEUMOVAX POLYSACCHARIDE PPSV23 (does not change 
    the short name that displays in CPRS or on Health Summary).
  
    Rename the reminder term VA-HIGH RISK FOR PNEUMOCOCCAL DZ to 
    VA-PNEUMOC DZ RISK - HIGH

 2. INC000000355037 - Missing CPT code in a taxonomy
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 The VA-WH PAP SMEAR SCREENING reminder has a taxonomy named "VA-WH PAP 
 SMEAR SCREEN CODES". This taxonomy does not have a 88175 CPT code in it. 
 From the CPT manual:
  
 88175: Cytopathology, cervical or vaginal (any reporting system), 
 collected in preservative fluid, automated thinlayer preparation; 
 screening by automated system, under physician supervision n/a as on 
 clinical lab.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 The 88175 CPT code was added to the taxonomy by the routines PXRMP36E and 
 PXRMP36I. They are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER 
 EXCHANGE (#811.8) file and the contents of these entries are installed 
 during the post-init.
