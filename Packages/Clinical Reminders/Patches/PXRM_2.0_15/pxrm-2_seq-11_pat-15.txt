  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch releases the new National
 VA-TBI/POLYTRAUMA REHAB/REINTEGRATION PLAN OF CARE 
 (TBI=Traumatic Brain Injury) reminder dialog. The 2008 National Defense
 Authorization Act directed VA to develop an individualized plan for
 rehabilitation and reintegration of each individual into the community, and
 to provide such plan in writing to each Veteran or member of the Armed Forces
 who receives inpatient or outpatient rehabilitative hospital care or medical
 services for traumatic brain injury.  This reminder has been developed and
 sponsored by The Office of Rehabilitation Services in VACO. The standardized
 national template that has been developed is to document this individualized
 Rehabilitation Care Plan. Congress has mandated  the template be installed
 on or by March 31, 2009.  This is the reason for the short compliance date.
   
 Host File:
 ==========
 This patch is distributed as a host file because in addition to the
 PXRM*2.0*15 build it contains TIU*1.0*246, which distributes a new Note
 Title and a new Document Class. The host file name is PXRM_2_0_15.KID
 
 Complete details can be found in the Installation and Setup Guide; see the
 documentation section below for instructions on how to get it. Before the
 installation is done, the TIU CAC  at your site should read the Installation
 and Setup Guide to know what is being installed and to determine if the new
 Title should be mapped to an existing Document Class or the Document Class
 that is installed with this patch. 
  
 Sites will retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.  The 
 preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.  This 
 transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also elect 
 to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.foalbany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fohines.med.va.gov>

 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take less 
 than 2 minutes. Installation should be coordinated with the person who manages
 Clinical Reminders at your site and be scheduled during a time of lower system 
 usage. 
  
 Using the Kernel KIDs menu
  
 1. Use the 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS installation menu.
    When prompted to enter a host file type in PXRM_2_0_15.KID
  
 2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options, as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (PXRM*2.0*15)
          
 4. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
    "respond 'NO'.

    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'No'. 
  
 6. When prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//," respond '0'.
    This installation should not be queued; it will be installing
    some packed reminder definitions and may require selection of
    replacements for some components. Therefore it is recommended
    that the site's Clinical Reminder Manager is present during the
    install.
  
 7. The init routine PXRMP15I may be deleted once the installation has 
    completed. Sites should use the Kernel "Delete Routines" option
    [XTRDEL] to delete this routine.
