 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:

 HD213991 - Updates for two AMIE C&P Exam Worksheets
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that updates be made to two
    current AMIE Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examination worksheets:
    Audio (#1305) and Genitourinary (#0605).
  
    Resolutions:
    ------------
    a) Created post-init routine DVBA128P, which will deactivate the
       current worksheets in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file and activate
       the new worksheets in the same file.  The current Internal
       Entry Numbers (IEN) for these worksheets are:  194 (Genitourinary)
       and 202 (Audio).  The new IENs will be:  224 (Genitourinary) and 
       225 (Audio).
    b) Created routine DVBCWAU7 which will contain the new text for the
       AMIE Audio C&P exam worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWAU6 which will
       access the text routine and print the worksheet.
    c) Created routine DVBCWGE5 which will contain the new text for the
       AMIE Genitourinary C&P exam worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWGE4
       which will access the text routine and print the worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA128P, will create two new
 records in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the two AMIE worksheets 
 described above and inactivate the existing records for those same two
 AMIE worksheets.  This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for historical
 purposes.  The 5th piece of the existing records will be updated with an
 "I", to indicate Inactive.  The 5th piece of the new records will contain
 an "A", indicating Active.
