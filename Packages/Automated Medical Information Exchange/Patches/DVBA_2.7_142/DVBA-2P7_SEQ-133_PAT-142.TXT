Subject: CAPRI TEMPLATES - STANDARD OBJECTS, PHASE I

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
   1. Standardized Panels, comprised of standardized components known 
      collectively as Standard Objects, have been developed for Compensation 
      & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) to standardize the exam questions
      being asked across Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM)  
      templates as they relate to certain body systems.   
   
   2. A major benefit of Standardized Panels, and Standard Objects in general,
      is the elimination of duplicate data entry for CAPRI CPWM templates
      that are merged and contain the same set of questions on individual 
      templates.  Once data has been entered on one of the merged templates,
      it will appear on all other merged templates which share its Standard
      Objects.
   
   3. Revised report coding for the Standard Objects has also been developed 
      so that the report format for each Standardized Panel or other Standard
      Object is consistent across templates.
   
   4. These new Standard Objects will be incorporated into the set of CPWM
      templates in a three-phase approach.  Patch DVBA*2.7*142 represents 
      Phase I of the initiative.
  
   5. Two defects have been corrected in the Medical Opinion template.

   The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service 
   Requests associated with this patch.

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
   The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality 
   that will be delivered in this patch.
  
   1. Content for a number of Standardized Panels has been approved 
      by the Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central
      Office (VBAVACO).  They are listed here, grouped by the template
      tab page to which each is related:
  
         HISTORY - Trauma, Neoplasm, Cardiac History, Pulmonary History
   
         PHYSICAL EXAM - Neoplasm Residuals, Cardiac Exam, Pulmonary Exam
           
         TEST - Stress Test Exceptions, LV Dysfunction, Heart Size
   
         DIAGNOSIS - Employment, Diagnosis
  
      The Capacity to Handle Financial Affairs button has been removed from
      the Diagnosis tab in the General Medical Examination template.
  
   2. This patch adds the Standard Objects listed above to the following
      templates, if they apply:
  
         ACROMEGALY
         ARRHYTHMIAS
         DIABETES MELLITUS
         GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION
         GULF WAR GUIDELINES
         HEART
         HEMIC DISEASES
         HYPERTENSION
         PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION
         PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS AND MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASES
         RESPIRATORY DISEASES, MISCELLANEOUS
         RESPIRATORY (OBSTRUCTIVE, RESTRICTIVE, AND INTERSTITIAL)
         THYROID AND PARATHYROID DISEASES
  
   3. In addition to the standard diagnosis panel questions, the 
      PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS AND MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASES template will 
      include questions specific to pulmonary tuberculosis and
      mycobacterial diseases previously displayed within the Diagnosis
      button are now included on the Diagnosis tab.  Submit logic has been
      removed from the diagnosis section.
  
   4. The values for the weight gain or loss percentage entered with Vital 
      Signs on the Physical Exam tab did not display the percent sign (%)
      with the possible values.  The values are now displayed as <10%, 10%,
      20%, 30% and 40% or more.
  
   5. Two defects have been corrected in the Medical Opinion template:
  
      - The legally recognized phrase 'Was less likely as not (50/50 
      probability) permanently aggravated by' will be changed to 'Was less 
      likely as not (less than 50/50 probability) permanently aggravated
      by'. The legally recognized phrases are selectable when entering a
      standard medical opinion.
  
      - '(NONSTANDARD EXAMINERS MEDICAL OPINION)' will be displayed 
      as'(STANDARD EXAMINERS MEDICAL OPINION)' on the report when a
      standard medical opinion is selected.
