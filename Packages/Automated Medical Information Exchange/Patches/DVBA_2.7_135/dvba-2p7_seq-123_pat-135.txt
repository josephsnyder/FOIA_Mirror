 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000278801 - Updates to the AMIE Audio C&P Exam Worksheet
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that an update be made to the 
 current AMIE C&P examination worksheet:  Audio (#1305).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a) Created post-init routine DVBA135P, which will inactivate the current
    Audio worksheet in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file and activate the
    updated Audio worksheet in the same file.  The current Internal Entry
    Number (IEN) for the Audio worksheet is 225.  The new IEN for the
    updated version of the Audio worksheet will be 228.  All records in
    the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file, as well as routines, are maintained for
    historical purposes.
 b) Created routine DVBCWAU9, which will contain the new text for the
    Audio worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWAU8, which will access the
    text routine and print the blank Audio worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA135P, will create a new record
 in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the updated version of the AMIE Audio
 C&P exam worksheet and inactivate the existing record for the Audio 
 worksheet.  This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for historical 
 purposes.  The 5th piece of the existing record, the Status field (.5), 
 will be updated with an "I", to indicate Inactive and the 5th piece of 
 the new record (IEN - 228), the Status field (.5), will be updated with 
 an "A", to indicate Active.
  
 Current Record Before Patch:
 ----------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,225,0)=AUDIO^AUDIO^3^DVBCWAU6^A^^1305
  
 Current Record After Patch Install:
 -----------------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,225,0)=AUDIO^AUDIO^3^DVBCWAU6^I^^1305
