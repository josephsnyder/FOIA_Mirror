Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
   An accelerated installation timeframe is being set for this new CAPRI
   executable due to recent regulation modifications affecting the
   Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) C&P examination protocol.  Modifications
   for this new TBI exam template have been completed, however this new 
   exam is dependent upon new functionality in CAPRI executable version
   DVBA*2.7*123.  To facilitate the implementation of the new TBI exam
   (will be released in patch DVBA*2.7*137) all sites are required to
   install this new CAPRI executable by November 19, 2008.  Because of 
   coordination necessary between all VHA, VBA, and non-VA users groups
   of CAPRI, all versions prior to DVBA*2.7*123 will be blocked from
   accessing Vista systems starting as soon as November 20, 2008.
 
   This patch is to announce the release of a new version of the
   Compensation & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) Graphical User
   Interface (GUI) v123. 
   
   Additionally, this patch (DVBA*2.7*123) contains VistA server
   modifications that support the release and installation of the new CAPRI
   GUI v123. 
  
   This patch (DVBA*2.7*123) should be installed on your VistA system
   before installing and using CAPRI GUI v123.

   *  This patch (DVBA*2.7*123) may be installed while CAPRI users are   *
   *  still using the previous CAPRI GUI version (v117 or earlier).      *
   *  Once the installation of this patch has been completed, CAPRI      *
   *  users should be upgraded to the new version of the CAPRI GUI v123  *

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
   The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality 
   that will be delivered in this patch.
  
   1. Broker Security Enhancement
      
      This patch will re-load the CAPRI GUI option context in order to
      attach broker calls inadvertently left off the option in previous
      CAPRI software distributions.
  
      Technical enhancements have been made to the CAPRI application to 
      allow the CAPRI GUI application to run using the new Broker Security 
      Enhancement (BSE) software. The BSE project was released in patches 
      XWB*1.1*45 and XU*8.0*404.  
  
      This patch adds one new entry named "CAPRI" to the REMOTE APPLICATION
      (#8994.5) file in VistA.  This will allow the CAPRI GUI application
      to run using the new Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) software. This
      new BSE-based mechanism will subsequently replace the current
      CAPRI-based mechanism for remote user/visitor access by RPC Broker
      Delphi-based client/server applications.
  
      The CAPRI application allows Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)
      staff to remotely access VistA data related to claims for veterans
      treated at any VistA site. The purpose of these technical
      enhancements is to fulfill the requirement for allowing VBA users to
      have secure access to patient information at remote sites.
  
      Detailed information on the BSE project can be found in the VHA
      software document library:  
       
        http://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=23
  
      Existing versions of CAPRI will not be affected by this patch. BSE 
      changes for non-remote (CLAIMS) users will be released in a future
      version of CAPRI.
  
  
   2. Simplified Patient Entry Screen - Suicide Prevention Team
  
      A simplified patient entry screen will be available for use by the
      Suicide Prevention team. The purpose of this modification is to 
      simplify the entry of a new patient into VistA through the CAPRI GUI.
  
      Users in remote mode and users on the CLAIMS system, can be assigned
      security key DVBA CAPRI SIMPLE PT ENTRY in order to exercise the
      simplified patient entry functionality.
  
      The following fields are required to complete the simplified patient
      entry screen:
  
       * First Name
       * Last Name
       * Gender
       * DOB
       * Patient Type
       * Veteran?
       * Service Connected?
      
      The following fields are available on the simplified patient entry
      screen, but are not required to complete this type of patient entry
      via CAPRI:
      
       * Address
       * Addr2
       * Addr3
       * City
       * State
       * Zip+4
       * Phone
       * Office Phone
       * County
  
      Please Note:
      ------------ 
      Security key DVBA CAPRI SIMPLE PT ENTRY will not be seen on local
      sites.
  
  
   3. Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module - Infrastructure
  
      This new CAPRI GUI contains technical enhancements to the 
      Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) infrastructure that
      will enable more robust Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam template
      performance and allow improved formatting on exam report outputs.
  
      The CAPRI GUI has been modified to support the use of a Pascal 
      Scripting engine. The Pascal Script engine will allow event
      procedures to be associated with screen objects (i.e. Buttons) on
      template forms. The Pascal Script (i.e. event procedures) performs
      the work when a screen object is clicked or changed on a template
      form.  The engine will also allow functions, procedures, and
      variables from the CAPRI GUI application to be imported and used
      within the template script, providing a more robust development
      environment for template developers.  This is a vast improvement over
      the scripting language that was used previously for template
      development.  Since the script is now event based and compiled, it
      executes faster than the previous template script, and will provide
      improved performance and usability to end-users.
  
      Currently, there are no functional or technical changes being made to
      the actual C&P exam templates. CAPRI users should not see any
      difference in template functionality or performance after installing
      the new CAPRI GUI v123.
  
      All previous (non-Pascal script) templates should function the same
      with the new CAPRI GUI v123 until the new upgraded (Pascal script)
      templates are distributed to the field in follow-up patch
      (DVBA*2.7*124).
  
  
   4. Setting Template Button Colors
      
      The CAPRI Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) has been
      enhanced to allow an end-user to set the color of buttons on a
      template. The color of the button will then be maintained between
      sessions.  
  
      The purpose of this modification is to allow CAPRI power users to
      mark certain template sections (i.e. buttons) with a color if they
      need to come back to them.
  
      The color of the button will then be maintained between sessions.  
      This will let power users mark certain template sections (i.e.
      buttons) if they need to come back to them. For example, exam
      reviewers could flag template sections for a user to review.
  
      A user may change the color of a button within a template by 
      right-clicking the button and selecting a color from the pop-up menu.
  
  
   5. Closing Exam Template Required
  
      Users will no longer have the ability to Close/Quit/Exit the CAPRI 
      GUI application if they have an exam template open. The purpose of
      this modification is to prevent a user from inadvertently exiting the
      CAPRI application without saving their work on an open exam template.
  
      If a user has a template open and attempts to Close/Quit/Exit the 
      CAPRI application, CAPRI will display a message box to the user
      "Please close the open Template."
  
  
   6. Exam Template Deletion
  
      The functionality for deleting a template has been modified.  The
      purpose of this modification is to prevent users from inadvertently 
      deleting templates.
  
      On the unsigned templates dialog and C&P Worksheets tab, users will
      now be required to enter a system generated verification code when
      attempting to delete a template to ensure the deletion is the
      intended action. If the verification code is not entered correctly or
      cancel is selected, the template deletion will not be completed.
  
      Additionally, the Delete button on the C&P Worksheets tab has been
      moved away from the Copy, Display, and Refresh buttons to prevent
      users from accidentally selecting Delete.
