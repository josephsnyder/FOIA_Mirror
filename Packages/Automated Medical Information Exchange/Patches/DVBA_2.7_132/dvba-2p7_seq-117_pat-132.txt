Subject: UPDATES NEEDED FOR PRINTING OF NEW C&P REQUESTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will update the DVBCUTL3 routine to print the Exam Reference 
 Number from the 2507 EXAM File (#396.4)  for each applicable Exam Type on 
 the requests generated by the options: Manual Printing of New C&P 
 Requests [DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P REQUESTS] and Print New C&P Requests (Task 
 Manager) [DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P REQ TM]. These requests are used by TIU
 transcribers to upload this data to the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925);
 however, the Exam Reference Number is not currently available to them.
  
 ************************************************************************
 NOTE:  The Internal Entry Number (IEN) of the entry in the 2507 EXAM File 
 (#396.4) will be displayed on the request as the TIU upload was designed
 to use this IEN when uploading Compensation and Pension Exam Reports into
 the 2507 Exam File (#396.4); see patch TIU*1*68.  CAPRI displays the 
 Internal Entry Number (IEN) of the entry in the 2507 EXAM File (#396.4) 
 as the EXAM REFERENCE NUMBER on the Exam Details Screen.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000248858 - Update Needed for Printing of New C&P Exam Requests
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A requirement exists for the printing of new C&P requests to
    print the Exam Reference Number.  TIU transcriptionists use
    these printouts to upload the data to the TIU DOCUMENT (#8925) file 
    and currently they have no means of obtaining the Exam Reference
    Number because it does not print on the new C&P requests:
  
    Manual Printing of New C&P Requests    [DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P REQUESTS]
    Print New C&P Requests (Task Manager) [DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P REQ TM]
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine DVBCUTL3 will be modified so that the IEN of the applicable
    Exam Reference Number (enclosed within parentheses), prints
    immediately following the Exam Type.  There can be 1 or more Exam
    Types on a new C&P request, so the applicable Exam Reference Number
    will print for each Exam Type.  For example:
  
    Before Patch:
  
      Selected exams: 
  
      AUDIO; EAR DISEASE; 
    
    After Patch:
  
      Selected exams: 
  
      AUDIO (Exam Ref#: 262); EAR DISEASE (Exam Ref#: 263);
