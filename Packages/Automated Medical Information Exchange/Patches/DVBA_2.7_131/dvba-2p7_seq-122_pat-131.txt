 HD244173 - Updates for AMIE Diabetes Mellitus Worksheet
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that updates be made to the 
 current AMIE Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examination worksheet:
 Diabetes Mellitus (#0410).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a) Created post-init routine DVBA131P, which will deactivate the
    current worksheet in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file and activate
    the updated worksheet in the same file.  The current Internal
    Entry Number (IEN) for this worksheet is 186.  The new IEN will
    be 226.
 b) Created routine DVBCWDI4, which will contain the new text for
    this worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWDI3, which will access
    the text routine and print the worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA131P, will create a new
 record in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the updated version of the 
 AMIE C&P worksheet described above and inactivate the existing record
 for this worksheet.  This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for 
 historical purposes.  The 5th piece of the existing record will be
 updated with an "I", to indicate Inactive and the 5th piece of the
 new record (IEN-226) will be updated with an "A", to indicate Active.
  
 Current Record Before Patch:
 ----------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,186,0)=DIABETES MELLITUS^DIABETES MELLITUS^12^DVBCWDIA^A^^0410
  
 Current Record After Patch:
 ---------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,186,0)=DIABETES MELLITUS^DIABETES MELLITUS^12^DVBCWDIA^I^^0410
  
 New Record Added with this Patch:
