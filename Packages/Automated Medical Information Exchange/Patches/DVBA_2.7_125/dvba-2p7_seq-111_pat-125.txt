    Problem:
    --------
    Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that a new AMIE Compensation
    and Pension Examination worksheet be created for:  Traumatic Brain
    Injury (TBI) (#1225).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    a) Created post-init routine DVBA125P, which will create and activate
       the new worksheet in the AMIE EXAM (# 396.6) file.  The new Internal
       Entry Number (IEN) will be 223 (Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
    b) Created routines DVBCTBI2 and DVBCTBI3 which will contain the text
       for the new AMIE Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) C&P Exam worksheet.
       Created routine DVBCTBI1 which will access the text routine(s) and
       print the worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA125P, will create a new record
 in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the new AMIE worksheet described
 above.  The 5th piece of the new record will contain an "A", indicating
 Active.
  
 New Record Added with this Patch:
