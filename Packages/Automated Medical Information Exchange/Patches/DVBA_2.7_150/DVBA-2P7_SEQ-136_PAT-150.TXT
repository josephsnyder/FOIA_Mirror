        A defect was reported when merging the ESOPHAGUS AND HIATAL HERNIA
        and RESPIRATORY DISEASES, MISCELLANEOUS templates. When data is
        entered into the "Other significant physical findings?" memo box on
        the "Physical Exam" tab of the ESOPHAGUS AND HIATAL HERNIA 
        template, the data is incorrectly being populated in the "Other
        significant physical findings:" memo box on the "Physical Exam" tab
        of the RESPIRATORY DISEASES, MISCELLANEOUS template.
  
        Solution

        On the AUDIO template, Diagnosis tab, a reply of "Yes" to the 
        question "Are there effects on usual daily activities: " does
        not appear on the report unless specific effects are also
        selected.
  
        Solution
        --------
        The report has been changed so that a "Yes" response to the
        question "Are there effects on usual daily activities:" without
        the selection of specific effects, appears on the report as: "ARE
        THERE EFFECTS ON USUAL DAILY ACTIVITIES? Yes, but none selected."
