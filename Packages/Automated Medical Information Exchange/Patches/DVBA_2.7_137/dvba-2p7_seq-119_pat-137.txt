Description:
============

   
    **************************************************************
    **** Installing this patch will prevent older versions of ****
    **** CAPRI from accessing your VistA system.  The newest  ****
    **** CAPRI version was released in patch DVBA*2.7*123.    ****
    **************************************************************
   
 I. OVERVIEW
  
 An accelerated installation timeframe is being set for this patch due to 
 recent regulation modifications affecting the Traumatic Brain Injury 
 (TBI) C&P examination protocol.  It is important that all sites upgrade 
 to this new exam template as soon as possible.  Additionally this patch 
 corrects an issue that could prevent Suicide Prevention Hotline staff and 
 VBA users from entering new patients, which is a crucial function for 
 both organizations.
  
  1. Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office
     (VBAVACO) has approved content changes for the Traumatic Brain
     Injury (TBI) template based on the current Compensation and Pension
     Examination worksheet for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
   
     This patch implements the content changes for Traumatic Brain
     Injury (TBI) template which is accessible through the Compensation &
     Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) of the Compensation & Pension Record
     Interchange (CAPRI) Graphical User Interface (GUI).
   
  
  2. This patch also introduces VistA server side changes to the Automated
     Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) package to prevent CAPRI GUI
     users from running older, unsupported versions of the CAPRI GUI.
      
     Specifically, users will be prevented from running CAPRI GUI versions
     that were released prior to the released patch DVBA*2.7*123 (Subject:
     UPDATES FOR BSE AND CPWM TEMPLATES AND ADD SUICIDE PREVENTION
     PATIENT). All prior versions of the CAPRI GUI are being shut off as
     they will be incompatible with technical upgrades being made to
     Compensation & Pension exam templates in this patch.
  
       ******************************************************************
       *                                                                *
       *                      I M P O R T A N T                         *
       *                                                                *
       ******************************************************************
       *                                                                *
       *  To avoid disruption of work, CAPRI GUI users that are still   *
       *  using CAPRI GUI version 117 (DVBA*2.7*117) or earlier should  *
       *  be upgraded to CAPRI GUI version 123 (DVBA*2.7*123) prior to  *
       *  the installation of this patch.                               *
       *                                                                *
       ******************************************************************
  
  
  3.  This patch also corrects a problem discovered during testing that
      generated an error while attempting to enter new patients from the
      "Patient Selector" screen in the CAPRI GUI.

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
   The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality 
   that will be delivered in this patch.
  
   1. The Traumatic Brain Injury exam template has undergone content 
      redesign changes based on the current Compensation and Pension
      (C&P) Examination worksheet for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
      Additionally, the new version of the TBI template has undergone
      technical enhancements and upgrades that allow it to be accessible
      through the Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) of the
      newly released CAPRI GUI v123 application. Please refer to patch
      DVBA*2.7*123 for further details regarding the release of CAPRI GUI
      v123.
  
   
   2. This patch also introduces VistA server side changes to the 
      Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) package to prevent
      CAPRI GUI users from running older, unsupported versions of the CAPRI
      GUI. Specifically, users will be prevented from running CAPRI GUI
      versions that were released prior to the released patch DVBA*2.7*123.
      All prior versions of the CAPRI GUI are being shut off as they will
      be incompatible with technical upgrades being made to Compensation &
      Pension exam templates in this patch.
  
      a) Users of the CAPRI GUI will be prevented from running CAPRI GUI
         versions that were released prior to patch DVBA*2.7*123 (Subject:
         UPDATES FOR BSE AND CPWM TEMPLATES AND ADD SUICIDE PREVENTION
         PATIENT).
  
      b) When a user attempts to log into a version of the CAPRI GUI that
         was released prior to patch DVBA*2.7*123, informational dialog 
         boxes will be displayed.
  
         The dialog box will contain the following text:
         - Your client software is older than the server on VistA. Please 
           contact IRM for assistance. VistA is running CAPRI GUI 
           V2.7*123*0*A.
  
         - Old versions of CAPRI will not run from this server.
  
         Once both dialog boxes are acknowledged by the user, the CAPRI GUI
         application will be terminated. In some instances, the CAPRI GUI
         application will not successfully terminate and remains running in
         the background.  If this happens, please use the Windows 'Task
         Manager' to end the 'CAPRI.exe' process.
  
  
   3. Invalid Date Of Birth (DOB) results returned in the potential
      duplicates list will be cleared to prevent validation errors when
      using the "Enter New Pt" button on the "Patient Selector" screen
      in the CAPRI GUI.
  
   
 IV. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
  
   The following section describes the technical components being exported
   with this patch.

   3. The following Routine(s) are being modified.
    
      Routine DVBAB1: The remote procedure VERSION^DVBAB1 has been modified
      to allow the CAPRI GUI to obtain the current version of the CAPRI
      software running on the VistA server and whether old versions
      (including old test versions) of the CAPRI GUI are allowed to run.
  
      Routine DVBAB84: A new procedure CLEANDOB^DVBAB84 has been added

       Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete it manually
       if you discover this at your site.
