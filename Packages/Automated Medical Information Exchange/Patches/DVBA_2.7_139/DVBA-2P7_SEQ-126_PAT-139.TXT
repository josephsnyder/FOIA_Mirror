 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
   The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality 
   that will be delivered in this patch.
  
   1. Content changes to the following C&P templates have been approved 
      by the Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central
      Office (VBAVACO):
  
           AUDIO
           EYE EXAMINATION
           SCARS
           TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
  
   2. Technical updates have been identified by an internal review of 
      the Pascal script design for the following templates.  Changes will
      not impact user interface or end users.
  
           EATING DISORDERS
           FIBROMYALGIA
           SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SURVEY
  
  
   3. This patch updates the following templates to resolve reported
      defects:
  
           DIABETES MELLITUS -When the question for 'Are there effects on 
           usual daily activities?' under the Diagnosis tab is answered
           "NO" the question/response was not displayed on the report.
           The report has been modified to display both question and 
           response and will now appear on the preview report and final
           report when answered "NO" as follows:
  
                 DIAGNOSIS 
              ========= 
                 ARE THERE EFFECTS ON DAILY ACTIVITIES?  No
  
  
           EYE EXAMINATION - A defect on the eye examination report is
           corrected in this patch.  Values entered in the Central Visual
           Acuity and Keratoconus portion of the eye examination template
           are not always displayed on the report.  For example, if the
           examiner did not populate the corrected or uncorrected vision
           for the patient's right eye but did populate the fields for the
           left eye, the report did not always display the values for the
           patient's left eye.  This problem has been resolved to always
           display the values from this portion of the eye exam on the
           report.
  
           GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION - When the General Medical 
           Examination template was merged with Gulf War Guidelines and/or 
           Prisoner of War Protocol Examination templates, CAPRI would 
           generate and 'Application Exception' error (Cannot focus
           disabled or invisible window). The Pascal script was modified 
           for the General Medical Examination template to prevent this 
           error from occurring.
  
           INITIAL EVALUATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) -  
           Updates to this template correct the text for Psych Summary on 
           the report to remove reference to 'last exam'.  Text will read 
           'Changes in functional status and quality following trauma
           exposure'.
  
           REVIEW EXAMINATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) -
           Updates to this template correct the text on the Psych Summary
           tab to read 'Changes in functional status and quality of life
           since last exam'.
  
           "Both" DSM-IV questions on Diagnosis tab should be answered 
           "YES" for the Psych Summary tab questions to be enabled.  
           Currently the questions on the Psych Summary tab are enabled
           when the questions 'Does the veteran meet the DSM-IV stressor
           criterion?' is answered "YES" and 'Does the veteran meet the
           DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD?' is answered "NO".  The
           template has been modified to only enable the Psych Summary tab
           questions when both DSM-IV questions are answered "YES". 
  
           SPINE - The "Detailed Motor Exam" panel is missing 'Knee
           flexion  (L4, L5, S1, S2), Sciatic N.(Hamstrings)' for both the
           right and left sides.  The template has been modified to include
           the missing questions and also display the data accurately on
           report preview and final report.
  
           TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY - Every TBI exam is expected to have at
           least one screening exam for cognitive impairment.  Current
           functionality displays this information in a popup box after the
           cognitive impairment question is answered 'Yes'.  This patch
           resolves this problem by removing the dependency on this
           question and informs reviewer of screening exam requirement.
  
           The following modifications resolve issues found by the
           development team:
  
             * Change 'function' to 'dysfunction' in the TBI: Endocrine
               Dysfunction text box on the Physical Exam tab.
             * Add 'daily activities' to the 'Are there effects of the
               problem on 'question on Diagnosis tab.       
             * Remove '(or post traumatic)' from the TBI: Headaches text
               box on the History tab.       
             * Add Knee Flexion and Sciatic N. (Hamstrings) to details for
               Motor Function exam section. 
             * Change 'privlileged' to 'privileged' in Note to Examiners.
             * TBI: Detailed Motor Exam section of the template. Commas
               added between 0 and 1 and between 3 and 4.
             * Tibial N. (Gastrocnemius, soleus Muscle) change to Tibial N.
               (Gastrocnemius, Soleus Muscle) on TBI: Detailed Motor Exam
               section of the template. 
             * In addition to the above modifications, several
               typographical errors were corrected.
  
  
 IV. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
  
   The following section describes the technical components being exported
   with this patch.

   2. The following Template Definition update will be added to the CAPRI 
      TEMPLATE DEFINITIONS (#396.18) file:
       
       * AUDIO~139
       * DIABETES MELLITUS~139
       * EATING DISORDERS~139
       * EYE EXAMINATION~139     
       * FIBROMYALGIA~139
       * GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION~139
       * INITIAL EVALUATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)~139
       * REVIEW EXAMINATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)~139
       * SCARS~139
       * SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SURVEY~139
       * SPINE~139
       * TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY~139
  
   3. The kill logic for the "AV" cross reference on the NAME (#.01) field 
      in the CAPRI TEMPLATE DEFINITIONS (#396.18) file has been modified.  
      The current logic does not delete the cross reference when the
      template name is modified.  CAPRI template definitions are updated
      by nationally released patches.  Previous patches killed the AV cross
      reference and re-indexed it as part of the post installation process.
      With the updated kill logic, this step is no longer needed.
