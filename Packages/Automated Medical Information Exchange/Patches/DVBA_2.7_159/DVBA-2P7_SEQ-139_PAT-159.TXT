   The following section contains an overview of the changes and primary

   1. CAPRI  - Worksheet Template Changes
  
      This patch implements changes to three CAPRI Compensation and 
      Pension examination worksheets, which are accessible through the
      CAPRI GUI application.
  
      a. Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office
         has approved the following changes on the following CAPRI
         templates:
     
         * DBQ ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE was modified:
  
           1. To reword the introductory paragraph to read "Your patient is
           applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
           disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you
           provide on this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in
           processing the Veteran's claim."
       
           2. To allow the user to record diagnostic test results 
           regardless of how they answer the section 5, "Diagnostic 
           Testing" question: "Is there evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or
           dilatation?". This change allows the examiner to record data
           supporting either a positive or negative decision.
  
           3. To enhance the second "NOTE:" under section 1, "Diagnosis",
           by adding the sentence "IHD encompasses any atherosclerotic
           heart disease resulting in clinically significant ischemia or
           requiring coronary revascularization."
  
         * DBQ LEUKEMIA was modified:
  
           1. To reword the introductory paragraph to read "Your patient is
           applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
           disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you
           provide on this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in
           processing the Veteran's claim."
  
         * DBQ PARKINSONS was modified:
  
           1. To reword the introductory paragraph to read "Your patient is
           applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
           disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you
           provide on this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in
           processing the Veteran's claim."
  
           2. To restructure Section 5, "Additional
           manifestations/complications due to Parkinson's or its
           treatment".  The section has been modified to allow the 
           selection of "Incontinence" and/or "Urinary retention". 
           The section has been restructured  to allow users to select "Use
           of an appliance" if either "Incontinence" or "Urinary retention"
           is chosen and to specify the number of absorbent pads used
           per day for "Incontinence."
  
   2. AMIE - C&P Examination Worksheet Changes
  
      This patch implements content changes for three AMIE C&P Disability
      Benefit Questionnaire worksheets, which are accessible through the
      VISTA AMIE software package.
  
      a. Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office
         has approved changes to the following automated AMIE C&P
         Questionnaire worksheets, based on a new C&P Disability Benefits
         Questionnaire worksheet.
  
         * DBQ ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE
  
           1. The introductory text has been changed to: "Your patient is 
           applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
           disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you
           provide on this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in
           processing the Veteran's claim."
  
           2. The second "NOTE:" under section 1,"Diagnosis", has been 
           clarified with the addition of a sentence, "IHD encompasses
           any atherosclerotic heart disease resulting in clinically
           significant ischemia or requiring coronary revascularization".
  
         * DBQ LEUKEMIA
  
           1. The introductory text has been changed to: "Your patient is 
           applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
           disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you
           provide on this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in
           processing the Veteran's claim."
  
         * DBQ PARKINSONS
  
           1. The introductory text has been changed to: "Your patient is 
           applying to the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for
           disability benefits.  VA will consider the information you
           provide on this questionnaire as part of their evaluation in
           processing the Veteran's claim."
  
           2. Section 5, "Additional manifestations/complications due to   
           Parkinson's or its treatment", "Urinary problems" section, has
           been clarified to allow the selection of "Incontinence" and/or
           "Urinary retention" as discrete problems.  The section has been
           restructured to indicate that "Use of an appliance" and "Specify
           the number of absorbent pads used per day" are not mutually
           exclusive.  
  
   3. CAPRI - Template Defects
  
      The following defect discovered by the CAPRI development team is
      being addressed:
       
      a.  Defect - On the CAPRI DBQ ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE template, 
          "Other  study (specify):" does not appear on report when no
          detail data is entered.
  
          Problem
          ------- 
          On the DBQ ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE template, when the examiner
          chooses "Other Study (specify):" and does not enter any data,
          "Other study (specify):" does not display on the report.
  
          Solution
          --------
          The template has been altered so that "Other study (specify):"
          appears on the report, whether any detail data is entered or not.
  
      b.  Defect - CAPRI - DBQ PARKINSONS Questionnaire Problem
  
          The following Remedy ticket is associated with this defect:
  
          * Remedy Ticket HD0000000442506 - CAPRI - DBQ PARKINSONS
            Questionnaire Problem
  
          Problem
          -------
          On the History tab, when entering data in the DBQ PARKINSONS
          Questionnaire template, Question 3, "Motor manifestations of 
          Parkinson's or its treatment", "Bradykinesia or slowed motion"
          radio group, if "Mild" is selected, both "Mild" and "Severe"
          are checked on the report.
  
          Solution
          --------
          The application has been changed so that only selections made by
          the user appear on the report.
  
   4. AMIE - C&P Examination Worksheet Defects
  
          a.  Defect - AMIE Examination worksheets intermittently not
              printing
  
          The following Remedy ticket is associated with this defect:
  
          * Remedy Ticket HD0000000438238 -  Worksheets Intermittently not
            Printing
  
          Problem
          -------
          Worksheets are printing intermittently since the installation of
          DVBA*2.7*154.  The problem occurs if multiple AMIE Worksheets are
          printed at the same time. This occurs because the DBQ print 
          routines are killing variables required by the second and
          subsequent worksheets.
  
          Solution
          --------
          The driver routines for the AMIE DBQ worksheets have been updated
          to preserve the variables that are shared between worksheets.
