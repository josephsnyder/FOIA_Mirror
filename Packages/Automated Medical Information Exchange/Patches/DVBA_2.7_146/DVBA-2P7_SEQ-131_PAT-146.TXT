 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1) HD0000000105567 - New C&P Patient Bulletin Not Generated
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When CAPRI remote users add new patients, a MAILMAN message is
 suppose to be generated notifying the "DVBA C NEW C&P VETERAN"
 group, but since these users do not have certain properties
 MailMan rejects it. 
    
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The mailman message will be generated using the bulletin function of 
 mailman which circumvents the validation process. Bulletin DVBA CAPRI NEW
 C&P VETERAN will be added as a component of this patch.
  
  
 2) HD0000000243064 - St. Cloud VAMC, Exam Cancel Mailgroup Msg Error
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When CAPRI remote users cancel exam requests a mail message is suppose
 to be sent to the  "DVBA C 2507 CANCELLATION" group, but since these
 users do not have certain properties MailMan rejects it. 
    
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The mailman message will be generated using the bulletin function of 
 mailman which circumvents the validation process. Bulletin DVBA CAPRI 2507
 CANCELLATION will be added as a component of this patch.
