       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup

       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,

       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you

    8. NOTE: Pre/Post-init routine DVBA2833 is a temporary routine used as
       part of the pre/post-install process and will be automatically
       deleted by KIDS after patch installation. However, in some cases
       Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete it manually
       if you discover this at your site.
