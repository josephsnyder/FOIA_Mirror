Subject: CAPRI CPWM TEMPLATE UPDATES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
   1. The Chief Business Office (CBO) and other CAPRI stakeholders have 
   requested the Dictation template released in DVBA*2.7*145 be renamed  
   to Blank Template along with other minor modifications. 
  
   This patch implements within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
   the requested modifications to the Compensation and Pension Records 
   Interchange (CAPRI) Compensation and Pension examination template 
   currently available as Dictation.  The Dictation template will be 
   de-activated and the new 'Blank Template' will be activated as its 
   replacement.  The 'Blank Template' will be accessible from CAPRI's 
   Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM).
  
   The Blank Template provides the following changes from the Dictation 
   template:
  
      - Tab on CAPRI screen is labeled 'Blank Template'.
      - Header for text block on CAPRI screen is labeled 'Compensation 
        and Pension Report (Free Text)'.   
      - Blank text field for entry of free text. 
      - The header for the report header is labeled 'COMPENSATION AND 
        PENSION EXAMINATION (FREE TEXT)'.  Examination text will be 
        displayed after the report header.
  
    2. This patch also modifies the Diabetes Mellitus template to correct 
    a reported defect with the display of the weight gain or loss
    percentage on the CAPRI report.
  
  
  
 II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
  
   The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service 
   Requests associated with this patch.

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
   The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality 
   that will be delivered in this patch.
  
   DICTATION
   =========
  
   The existing DICTATION template will be inactivated with this patch.
  
   BLANK TEMPLATE
   ==============
  
   BLANK TEMPLATE will be added and available for the first time through 
   patch DVBA*2.7*147.  
  
   DIABETES MELLITUS
   =================
  
   The weight gain or loss percentage entered on the Physical Exam tab in
   the Diabetes Mellitus template in CAPRI was not displaying correctly on 
   the CAPRI report.  The weight gain or loss value is displayed on the
   report as <1%, 1%, 2% and 3% rather than <10%, 10%, 20% or 30%.  A loss
   or gain of 40% or more is displayed as '40 or mor%' rather than '40% or
   more'.
  
   The report will be modified to correctly display the weight gain or loss
   percentage.

          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is

             deleted by KIDS after patch installation. However, in some
             cases Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete
             it manually if you discover this at your site.
