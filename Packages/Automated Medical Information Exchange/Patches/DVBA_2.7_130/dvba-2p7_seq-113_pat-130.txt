Subject: CORRECTION TO NEW AMIE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY WORKSHEET NUMBER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the Worksheet number for AMIE C&P Worksheet - 
 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  This is a new AMIE worksheet that was 
 recently added to the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file via patch DVB*2.7*125.  At
 the time of development, the VACO directed the use of worksheet number 
 #1225 for this new worksheet, not knowing that worksheet number #1225 was 
 already in use by another active AMIE C&P Worksheet (Neurological 
 Disorders, Miscellaneous).

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD228638 - DVBA*2.7*125 new worksheet number already in use
  
    Problem:
    --------
    During the development of new AMIE C&P Worksheet - Traumatic Brain
    Injury (TBI), the VACO directed the use of worksheet number #1225,
    not knowing that this number was already in use by another active
    AMIE C&P Worksheet (Neurological Disorders, Miscellaneous).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    It has been verified that worksheet number #1240 is not in use by
    any active AMIE C&P Worksheets.  Therefore, post-init routine
    DVBA130P, will properly edit the worksheet number for AMIE C&P
    Worksheet - Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) 
    file to #1240.
