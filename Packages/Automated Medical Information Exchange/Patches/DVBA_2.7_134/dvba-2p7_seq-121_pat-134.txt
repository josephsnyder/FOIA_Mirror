 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000276710 - Update for AMIE Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Worksheet
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that an update be made to the 
 current AMIE C&P examination worksheet:  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a) Created post-init routine DVBA134P, which will deactivate the current
    worksheet in the AMIE Exam file (#396.6) and activate the updated
    worksheet in the same file.  The current Internal Entry Number (IEN)
    for this worksheet is 223.  The new IEN for the updated version will
    be 227.
 b) Created routines DVBCTBI5, DVBCTBI6 and DVBCTBI7, which will contain
    the new text for this worksheet.  Created routine DVBCTBI4, which will
    access the text routines and print the blank worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA134P, will create a new record
 in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the updated version of the AMIE C&P
 worksheet described above and inactivate the existing record for this
 worksheet.  This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for historical purposes.
 The 5th piece of the existing record will be updated with an "I", to
 indicate Inactive and the 5th piece of the new record (IEN-227) will be
 updated with an "A", to indicate Active.
  
 Current Record Before Patch:
 ----------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,223,0)=TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI)^TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
 INJURY^13^DVBCTBI1^A^^1240
  
 Current Record After Patch:
 ---------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,223,0)=TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI)^TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
 INJURY^13^DVBCTBI1^I^^1240
  
 New Record Added with this Patch:
 ---------------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,227,0)=TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI)^TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
 INJURY^13^DVBCTBI4^A^^1240
