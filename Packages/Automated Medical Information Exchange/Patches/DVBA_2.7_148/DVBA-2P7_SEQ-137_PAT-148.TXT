Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
    The Enterprise System Management (ESM) office has given Compensation
    and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) approval to provide the Health
    Revenue Center (HRC) First Party Call Center contact representatives
    with enhancements to the current HRC menu structure.  Modifications
    will include two new menus and additional VistA options for two of the
    existing HRC menus distributed in patch DVBA*2.7*84 released on
    12/22/2006.
  
    CAPRI provides local common service access to VistA for HRC 
    CAPRI remote users. The CAPRI Enhancement project will be modifying the
    current HRC menu structure to support the needs of the HRC First Party
    Call Center. The HRC First Party Call Center contact representatives
    handle calls from veterans related to the Consolidated Co-payment
    Processing Center (CCPC) billing statements.  Many of the questions
    require research using VistA options from several packages including
    Accounts Receivable, Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS),
    Integrated Billing, Kernel, Pharmacy and Registration. The HRC needs
    this information in order to provide 'first call resolution' to
    veterans.
  
    This patch adds options from the Outpatient Pharmacy and 
    Integrated Billing packages to the HRC First Party CC menu.  
    Outpatient Pharmacy and Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
    options will be added to the HRC Pharmacy Menu.  It also distributes
    two new menus called HRC First Party Extended Services and HRC Pharmacy
    Customer Care Menu. The options found in these menus will be existing
    VistA options from Accounts Receivable, Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS), Integrated Billing, Outpatient Pharmacy and
    Registration.

       until an updated version of the CAPRI GUI application is released.
  
       HRC users are assigned one of the existing three HRC menus as their
       primary menu. When the CAPRI HRC remote user connects to a site
       through CLAIMS, the HRC user is assigned the HRC menu as their
       primary menu. The CAPRI GUI application must be modified to
       recognize the new HRC First Party Extended Services menu and
       HRC Pharmacy Customer Care Menu and assign this menu as the user's
       primary menu at the remote site.
  
    6. The following INTEGRATION CONTROL REGISTRATION's (ICR's) have been
       added or modified.
      
      a. Added new ICR #5542 allowing access to additional Order Entry/
         Results Reporting options.
      
            ICR REFERENCE: 5542
                     NAME: Ward Clerk Menu Access
        CUSTODIAL PACKAGE: ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING     
      SUBSCRIBING PACKAGE: AUTOMATED MED INFO EXCHANGE                
                          
              The Health Revenue Center (HRC) is using the telnet
              functionality in the CAPRI application to view patient
              data across all VistA systems. CAPRI provides local
              common service to VistA for HRC CAPRI remote users and
              the HRC needs usage of the following menu option listed
              in this Integration Control Registration: 
                          
                   Ward Clerk Menu [OR MAIN MENU WARD CLERK]
                    
                     USAGE: Controlled Subscription
                   ENTERED: JUN 29,2010
                    STATUS: Active     
                      TYPE: Other
      DESCRIPTION:
      The Ward Clerk Menu [OR MAIN MENU WARD CLERK] will be added to the
      HRC Pharmacy Menu [DVBA HRC MENU PHARMACY] option and the new menu,
      HRC Pharmacy Customer Care Menu [DVBA HRC MENU PHARMACY CC]. The
      Ward Clerk Menu option will be used by the HRC contact 
      representatives and distributed in patch DVBA*2.7*148. The HRC has
      provided the following justification for access to the Ward Clerk
      Menu option: 
     
      The request for the VistA option Ward Clerk Menu [OR MAIN MENU WARD
      CLERK] will provide additional functionality to flag renewal requests
      for provider action. Renewal of prescriptions that have expired or
      have no refills remaining constitute 26.1% of the calls fielded by
      the HRC Pharmacy Customer Care Center (PCCC). This type of call 
      cannot be easily resolved by the facility pharmacies, because action
      on the part of the provider is required. With access to the option,
      the HRC agent can send a "View Alert" directly to the provider
      through VistA. The provider will receive the "View Alert" immediately
      upon being flagged by the HRC agent to ensure prompt attention and
      resolution of the required prescription renewal. Safeguards are built
      into the Ward Clerk version of the VistA option not allowing the HRC
      PCCC agent to discontinue, copy, change or renew a prescription
      without verification by a facility clinician. CAPRI does recognize
      provider's credentials, therefore any renewals flagged by HRC 
      agents would not be processed until signed off by the provider.
     
      b. Modified ICR #4590 allowing access to additional Accounts
         Receivable options.

       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
    2. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    3. From the 'Installation' menu, you may now select the following 
       options prior to installing the patch.
  
       NOTE: Running the following options is OPTIONAL.  When prompted for

       a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
  
       b. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
       
       c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
  
       d. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT

    8. NOTE: Pre/Post-init routine DVBA2848 is a temporary routine used as
       part of the pre/post-install process and will be automatically
       deleted by KIDS after patch installation. However, in some cases
       Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete it manually
       if you discover this at your site.
