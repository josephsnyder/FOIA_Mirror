Subject: CAPRI TEMPLATES - STANDARD OBJECTS, PHASE II

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
   1. Standardized Panels, comprised of standardized components known 
      collectively as Standard Objects, have been developed for Compensation 
      & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) to standardize the exam questions
      being asked across Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM)  
      templates as they relate to certain body systems. 
  
   2. A major benefit of Standardized Panels, and Standard Objects in 
      general, is the elimination of duplicate data entry for CAPRI CPWM 
      templates that are merged and contain the same set of questions on 
      individual templates.  Once data has been entered on one of the merged
      templates, it will appear on all other merged templates which share 
      its Standard Objects.
   
   3. Revised report coding for the Standard Objects has also been developed 
      so that the report format for each Standardized Panel or other Standard
      Object is consistent across templates.
   
   4. These new Standard Objects will be incorporated into the set of CPWM
      templates in a three-phase approach.  The first phase of this 
      initiative, Patch DVBA*2.7*142, CAPRI TEMPLATES - STANDARD OBJECTS,
      PHASE I, was released on December 2, 2009.  Patch DVBA*2.7*151, CAPRI
      TEMPLATES - STANDARD OBJECTS, PHASE II is the second step of the 
      initiative.
  
   5. Several modifications have been made to templates to correct both 
      functional and textual defects.  The affected templates include:
        - AID AND ATTENDANCE OR HOUSEBOUND EXAMINATION
        - BLANK TEMPLATE
        - EPILEPSY AND NARCOLEPSY
        - EYE EXAMINATION
        - GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION
        - GULF WAR GUIDELINES
        - HYPERTENSION
        - PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION
        - TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
   The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality 
   that will be delivered in this patch.
  
   1. Content for a number of Standardized Panels has been approved 
      by the Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central

      tab page to which each is related:
  
         HISTORY - Trauma, Neoplasm
   
         PHYSICAL EXAM - Residuals of Neoplasm, Motor Function, Sensory
                         Function, Reflexes
             
         DIAGNOSIS - Employment History, Financial Affairs, Diagnosis
  
   2. This patch adds the Standard Objects listed above to the following 
      templates, if they apply:
  
      AID AND ATTENDANCE OR HOUSEBOUND EXAMINATION
      BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD
      COLD INJURY PROTOCOL EXAMINATION
      CUSHINGS SYNDROME
      DIABETES MELLITUS 
      GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION 
      GULF WAR GUIDELINES

      PERIPHERAL NERVES 
      PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION 
      SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SURVEY 
      SPINE
      TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY 
  
   3. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
      development team are being addressed:
      
      a.  Defect - Inconsistent report format for non-specific weight changes
  
      Problem
      ------- 
      On several templates, weight changes without a specified quantity 
      appear on reports with inconsistent formats. 
       
      Solution
      --------
      On the following templates: AID AND ATTENDANCE OR HOUSEBOUND 
      EXAMINATION; COLD INJURY PROTOCOL EXAMINATION; DIABETES MELLITUS; 
      GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION; GULF WAR GUIDELINES; HYPERTENSION; 
      NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, MISCELLANEOUS; PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL 
      EXAMINATION; TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, weight changes without a 
      specified quantity will appear on reports as:
       "WEIGHT CHANGE: Gain - baseline percentage change not provided." or 
       "WEIGHT CHANGE: Loss - baseline percentage change not provided." 
  
      b.  Defect - Missing data on Cardiac Exam report
      
      Problem
      -------
      On the DIABETES MELLITUS, GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION, GULF WAR 
      GUIDELINES, HYPERTENSION, and PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION
      templates, Physical Exam tab, the Cardiac Exam section of the report
      does not display information entered into the "Describe and state 
      significance of extra heart sounds noted:" memo box unless "Other" 
      is selected in the "Extra heart sounds:" list box.
          
      Solution
      --------
      The Cardiac Exam report on these templates has been altered so that 
      information entered into the "Describe and  state significance of 
      extra heart sounds noted:" memo box is included in the report, 
      whether or not "Other" is selected in the "Extra heart sounds:" list
      box.
  
      c.  Defect - Inconvenient tabbing order on Vital Signs panel
      
      Problem
      -------
      On the GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION, GULF WAR GUIDELINES, and PRISONER
      OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION templates, the tabbing order on the Vital 
      Signs panel is inconvenient for clinicians.  This issue was raised by 
      Dr. Sven Ljaamo of the VA Healthcare Network Upstate New York. 
             
      Solution
      --------
      On these templates, the tabbing order on the Physical Exam tab, 
      Vital Signs panel has been changed to facilitate data entry during 
      exams.  
  
      d.  Defect - GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION template is missing the 
                   Mental Competency panel on the Diagnosis tab
      
      Problem
      -------
      On the GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION template, the Mental Competency 
      panel (Capacity to Handle Financial Affairs button) is missing 
      from the Diagnosis tab. 
              
      Solution
      --------  
      The Mental Competency panel has been restored to the Diagnosis tab of
      the GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION template.
  
      e.  Defect - Single digit Tonometry reading not appearing on reports
      
      Problem
      -------
      On the EYE EXAMINATION Template, Physical Exam tab, Tonometry section,
      a single digit pressure reading entered into the Right or Left Eye 
      Pressure input box does not appear on reports.
              
      Solution
      --------
      The EYE EXAMINATION Template, Physical Exam tab, Tonometry section,
      has been changed so that single digit entries in the Right or Left Eye 
      Pressure input box will appear on reports. 
  
      f.  Defect - Incorrect terms on the EPILEPSY AND NARCOLEPSY template
      
      Problem
      -------
      On the EPILEPSY AND NARCOLEPSY template, the terms "conclusive" and 
      "non-conclusive" appear where "convulsive" and "non-convulsive" are
      the correct terms.
              
      Solution
      --------
      The EPILEPSY AND NARCOLEPSY template has been edited.  The term 
      "non-conclusive" has been replaced with "non-convulsive". The term
      "conclusive" has been replaced with "convulsive".
  
      g.  Defect - When a BLANK TEMPLATE and a MEDICAL OPINION 
                   template are merged, unintended data sharing occurs
      
      Problem
      -------
      When a BLANK TEMPLATE and MEDICAL OPINION template are merged,
      data entered in the BLANK TEMPLATE, Free Text area appears in
      the MEDICAL OPINION template, Medical Opinion Summary text area 
      (and vice versa).
              
      Solution
      --------
      This patch eliminates the overlap. Data entered in either the BLANK
      TEMPLATE, Free Text area or the MEDICAL OPINION template, 
      Summary text area no longer appears in the other.
  
      h.  Defect - HYPERTENSION template not clear on METS assessment
                   requirement
             
      Problem
      -------
      The METS information on the HYPERTENSION template was confusing to 
      some providers as to whether or not METS assessment is needed for 
      hypertension due to the Note to Examiners instructions located on the 
      Physical Exam tab.
   
      Solution
      --------
      On the HYPERTENSION template the following two changes were made:
       - Test tab, the " Stress test results: METS" section has been 
         removed from the template.
       - Physical Exam tab, Cardiac Exam panel, the Examiners Note has been
         modified to remove METS exercise testing from the note.  
  
      i.  Defect - TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY template not prompting for 
                   behavioral signs due to co-morbidity or TBI
      
      Problem
      -------
      The TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY template is not adequately prompting
      examiners to indicate whether behavioral signs and symptoms are due
      to a co-morbid mental disorder or to TBI.
       
      Solution
      --------      
      On the TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY template, Physical Exam tab, when the 
      examiner answers "Yes" to the question "Psychiatric Manifestations 
      Present?", a pop-up message is presented: "When a mental disorder is 
      present, state, or ask the mental disorders examiner to state, to the 
      extent possible, which emotional/behavioral signs and symptoms are 
      part of a co-morbid mental disorder and which represent residuals of
      TBI.  If it is not possible to make such a determination without 
      speculation, so state." 
  
     
      j.  Defect - AID AND ATTENDANCE OR HOUSEBOUND EXAMINATION template
          contains repetitious questions about lower extremity functional
          limitations
  
      Problem
      -------
  
      The AID AND ATTENDANCE OR HOUSEBOUND EXAMINATION template, Physical
      Exam tab, Lower Extremities Functional Limitations form, contains
      repetitious questions.  Input options provided by selecting "Other"
      from either the Right or Left lower extremity functional limitations
      list box and associated "Describe functional restrictions..." memo
      box are already available using the "Are there other functional
      limitations of the lower extremity" buttons and "Describe other 
      functional limitations" memo box.
  
      Solution
      --------
     
      Remove "Other" as an option under Right and Left lower extremities
      functional limitations.  Remove "Describe functional restrictions..."
      memo boxes under the Right and Left lower extremities functional
      limitations list boxes.
