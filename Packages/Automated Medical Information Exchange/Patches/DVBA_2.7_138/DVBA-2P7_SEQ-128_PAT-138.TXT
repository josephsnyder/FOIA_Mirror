 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000284679 - Update to AMIE Eye Exam C&P Worksheet
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that an update be made to the 
 current AMIE C&P examination worksheet:  Eye Examination (#1330).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a) Created post-init routine DVBA138P which will deactivate the current
    worksheet in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file and activate the updated
    worksheet in the same file.  The current Internal Entry Number (IEN)
    for this worksheet is 216.  The new IEN for the updated version will
    be 229.
 b) Created routine DVBCWEE6 which will contain the new text for this
    worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWEE5, which will access the text
    routine and print the blank worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA138P, will create a new record 
 in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the updated version of the AMIE C&P 
 worksheet described above and inactivate the existing record for this 
 worksheet.  This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for historical 
 purposes.  The 5th piece of the existing record will be updated with an 
 "I", to indicate it is Inactive and the 5th piece of the new record
 (IEN-229) will be updated with an "A", to indicate it is Active.
  
 Current Record Before Patch:
 ----------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,216,0)=EYE EXAMINATION^EYE^3^DVBCWEE3^A^^1330
  
 Current Record After Patch:
 ---------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,216,0)=EYE EXAMINATION^EYE^3^DVBCWEE3^I^^1330
