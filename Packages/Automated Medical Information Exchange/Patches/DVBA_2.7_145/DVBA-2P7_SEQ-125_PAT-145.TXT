Subject: CAPRI CPWM TEMPLATE UPDATE - DICTATION

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
   The Chief Business Office (CBO) and other CAPRI stakeholders have  
   approved the use of a new Compensation and Pension (C&P) Examination  
   worksheet. 
  
   This patch implements within the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) a 
   Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI) a Compensation and 
   Pension examination template for dictation.  The Dictation template can
   be accessed through CAPRI's Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module
   (CPWM).
  
   The reason for the Dictation template is due to an incident that
   occurred at a number of medical centers who were using Class III
   software to import dictated C&P exams from CPRS/TIU into AMIE/CAPRI.  
   Due to the incidents caused by this Class III software, OI&T is taking
   preventative measures and is working with the impacted sites to remove
   the Class III software.  This CAPRI Dictation template will provide
   sites with the capability to easily import dictated C&P exams into
   CAPRI, which in turn will automatically save the exam results back into
   TIU; somewhat lessening the burden from no longer having access to the
   Class III software package.  An accelerated installation timeframe is 
   being set for the new Dictation template.  Sites are required to 
   install this patch no later than July 24,2009.

    * Required Builds:
  
      The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS
      distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
      without their prior installation.
  
       Required Build(s):
       ------------------
       DVBA*2.7*124
  
   * Installation Steps:
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload

       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is

       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport

    8. NOTE: Pre/Post-init routine DVBA2845 is a temporary routine used as

             deleted by KIDS after patch installation. However, in some
             cases Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete
             it manually if you discover this at your site.
