 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:

 HD0000000304470 - Update to AMIE Scars Exam C&P Worksheet
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that updates be made to the 
 current AMIE C&P examination worksheet:  Scars (#1605).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a) Created post-init routine DVBA141P, which will deactivate the current
    Scars worksheet in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file and activate the updated
    Scars worksheet in the same file.  The current Internal Entry Number
    (IEN) for the Scars worksheet is 210.  The new IEN for the updated 
    Scars worksheet will be 230.
 b) Created routine DVBCWSW7, which will contain the new text for the
    Scars worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWSW6, which will access the text
    routine and print the blank Scars worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA141P, will create a new record
 (IEN=230) in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the updated version of the
 AMIE Scars Exam C&P worksheet and inactivate the existing record (IEN=210)
 for the Scars worksheet.  This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for
 historical purposes.  The 5th piece of the existing record will be 
 updated with an "I", to indicate Inactive and the 5th piece of the new
 record will be updated with an "A", to indicate Active.
  
 Current Record Before Patch:
 ----------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,210,0)=SCARS^SCARS^11^DVBCWSW4^A^^1605
  
 Current Record After Patch:
 ---------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,210,0)=SCARS^SCARS^11^DVBCWSW4^I^^1605
  
 New Record Added with this Patch:
 ---------------------------------
 ^DVB(396.6,230,0)=SCARS^SCARS^11^DVBCWSW6^A^^1605
