  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct a problem which exists when printing new 
 Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) Compensation and Pension
 requests.  Specifically, only the patient's permanent address prints which
 causes a problem when it is a Domiciliary patient.  When applicable, the
 patient's temporary address should also be printed if one has been
 entered into the system.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD191658 - Form VA21-2507
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When printing new AMIE Compensation and Pension requests via 
     Manual Printing of New C&P Requests [DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P
     REQUESTS] option, the report only prints the patient's permanent
     address. This creates a problem when it is a Domiciliary patient 
     and a temporary address has been entered into the system.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routines DVBCREQ1 and DVBCUTIL will be modified so that, when
     applicable, the patient's temporary address is also printed.
