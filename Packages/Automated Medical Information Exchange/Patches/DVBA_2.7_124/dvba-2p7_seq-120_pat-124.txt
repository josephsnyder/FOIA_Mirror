Subject: CAPRI TEMPLATE UPGRADES FOR GUI V123

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
   1. This patch introduces changes and enhancements to the Automated
      Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) package in support of the
      Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) within the
      Compensation & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) Graphical User
      Interface (GUI).
  
      Technical enhancements and upgrades are being made to individual
      Compensation & Pension exam templates that will result in improved
      usability and performance for end-users within the CAPRI Compensation
      & Pension Worksheet Module.

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
   The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality 
   that will be delivered in this patch.
  
   1. Improved Template Performance and Usability
  
      The CAPRI Template run-time engine was re-coded in the Pascal 
      programming language which allows for faster processing than the
      previous template engine.  All  Compensation & Pension (C&P) exam
      templates have been converted (re-scripted) to the Pascal programming
      language to be compatible with the new run-time engine.  This
      re-scripting of the templates provides the benefit of the templates
      loading faster as well as faster navigation within the template(s).
  
      Technical enhancements and upgrades are being made to the following
      (58) C&P exam templates that are accessible through the CAPRI GUI-
      Compensation & Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM). These enhancements
      and upgrades will result in improved usability and performance for
      end-users.

      AMPUTATION
      ----------
      a) The AMPUTATION template is being de-activated and will no longer
         be available for selection in CAPRI's  Compensation & Pension
         Worksheet Module (CPWM).  The name of the AMPUTATION template is
         being changed from 'AMPUTATION' to 'RESIDUALS OF AMPUTATIONS'.
         Only the name has been changed and the template content has not
         been modified.
  
      AUDIO
      -----
      a) Physical Exam tab: The Puretone Threshold Measurements were not 
         averaging correctly when a space was entered within the
         measurement and this has been corrected.
  
      b) Contains new report format which includes consolidation of user 
         responses.
  
      EYE EXAMINATION
      ---------------
      a) Significant content and workflow changes have been made based upon
         the recommendations of VBA content experts.
  
      b) Physical Exam tab, Central Visual Acuity and Keratoconus button:
         The word  contraindicated  was misspelled as 'contradicted' in 
         the bolded directions for eye.  The misspelling has been 
         corrected.
  
      GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION
      ---------------------------
      a) History tab, GU button, Urinary incontinence='YES':  The 'Type of 
         leakage' list box now allows multi selection.
  
      b) History tab: The field 'Other significant history or comments' was
         not appearing on the report. This defect has been corrected and
         the field now appears on the report output.
  
      c) Physical Exam tab, Endocrine button: The word 'Exophthalmos' was 
         spelled wrong in the question 'Is there evidence of exophthalmos'
        on the Endocrine Exam panel.
  
      d) Physical Exam tab, Abdomen/GI button, All Normal button: Multiple 
         'Normal values were appearing in the 'Rectal exam:' text box area
         when 'All Normal' is clicked multiple times. This has been
         corrected so that once the 'All Normal' button is selected, the
         'Normal' value will only populate once.
  
      GENITOURINARY EXAMINATION
      -------------------------
      a) History tab, Urinary leakage?='YES': The 'Which of these are 
         required?' list box for urine leakage now allows for multi
         selection.
  
      GULF WAR GUIDELINES
      -------------------
      a) Physical Exam tab, Abdomen/GI button, All Normal button: Multiple 
         'Normal' values were appearing in the 'Rectal exam:' text box area

         corrected so that once the 'All Normal' button is selected, the
         'Normal' value will only populate once.
  
      b) History tab, Problem Details button: The following questions have
         been added to the Document Problems window:
          i) Provide the details about onset, frequency, duration, and
             severity of all complaints.
         ii) For all symptoms, list the factors that precipitate and
             relieve them.
      
      HAND, THUMB AND FINGERS

         the Range of Motion sections were extensively revised, and the 
         amount of data collected was decreased.
  
      c) Physical Exam tab, ROM of Joints Affected by Disease or Injury
         button, Review Normal ROM (Text) button, Knee button: Under text
         ROM for knee, Lachman's test, now states:  'the normal is less

      ------------------------------------
      a) Physical Exam tab, Endocrine button: On the Endocrine Exam panel,
         the word 'exophthalmos' was spelled wrong in the question 'Is
         there evidence of exophthalmos'. This misspelling has been
         corrected.
  
      b) Physical Exam tab, Abdomen/GI button: On the
         Abdomen/Gastrointestinal Abnormality panel, when clicking the 'All
         Normal' button multiple times, the word  Norma ' was being
         inserted into the  Rectal exam  area multiple times. This has been
         corrected so that once the 'All Normal' button is selected, the
         'Normal' value will only populate once.
  
      c) Physical Exam tab, General button: Added checks for all three
