 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000319359 - Updates to the AMIE Joints Exam and Spine Exam C&P
                   Worksheets
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that updates be made to the 
 current AMIE C&P examination worksheets:  Spine (#1440) and Joints
 Shoulder/Elbow/Wrist/Hip/Knee/Ankle) (#1430).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a) Created post-init routine DVBA144P, which will deactivate the current
    Spine and Joints worksheets in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file and activate
    the updated Spine and Joints worksheets in the same file.  The current
    Internal Entry Number (IEN) for the Spine worksheet is 182 and the
    current IEN for the Joints worksheet is 201.  The new IEN for the
    updated Spine worksheet will be 231 and the new IEN for the updated
    Joints worksheet will be 232.
  
 b) Created routines DVBCWSP1 and DVBCWSP2, which will contain the new
    text for the Spine worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWSP, which will 
    access the text routines and print the blank Spine worksheet.
  
 c) Created routine DVBCWJW7, which will contain the new text for the
    Joints worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWJW6, which will access the
    text routine and print the blank Joints worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA144P, will create 2 new records 
 (IEN=231 and IEN=232) in the AMIE EXAM (#396.6) file for the updated 
 versions of the AMIE Spine Exam C&P worksheet and the AMIE Joints Exam 
 C&P worksheet and inactivate the 2 existing records (IEN=182 and 
 IEN=201).  This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for historical 
 purposes.  The 5th piece of the existing records will be updated with an 
 "I", to indicate Inactive and the 5th piece of each of the new records 
 will be updated with an "A", to indicate Active.
