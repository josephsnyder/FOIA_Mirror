  (2) reviewing death unrelated/related assignments to operations
"KRN",19,9653,1,4,0)
 
"KRN",19,9653,1,5,0)
The full report includes all patients who had operations within the

selected date range who experienced intraoperative occurrences,
"KRN",19,9653,1,7,0)
postoperative occurrences or death within 90 days of surgery. The

"KRN",19,9653,1,14,0)
have occurred within 30 days prior to any postoperative occurrences or
"KRN",19,9653,1,15,0)
within 90 days prior to death. Therefore, this report may include some
"KRN",19,9653,1,16,0)
operations that were performed prior to the selected date range and, if
"KRN",19,9653,1,17,0)

includes any operations that may have occurred within 30 days prior to any

"KRN",19,9653,1,31,0)
this report may include some operations that may or may not be risk
