 application as requested by the Executive Board of the National Surgical
 Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and by the Cardiac Surgery Consultants
 Board of the Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP).
 The updates include the addition of new data fields, changes to existing 
 data fields, changes to data entry screens, changes to reports used in 
 Surgery Risk Assessment management process and changes to the Surgery Risk
 Assessment transmissions.
  
 Non-Cardiac Assessment Modifications
 ------------------------------------
 - List of Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA ASSESSMENT LIST] option
   o When printing the List of Transmitted Assessments to screen or
     printer, the user is prompted to view/print assessed cases only,
     excluded cases only or both. Additionally, the user is prompted to
     view/print the list by date of operation or by date of transmission.
   o When printing the List of Eligible Cases to screen or printer, the 
     user is prompted to view/print assessed cases only, excluded cases 
     only, non-assessed cases only or all cases.
   o A new list, the List of Cases With No CPT Codes is added. This list 
     displays all completed cases that have not been coded with CPT codes.
   o A new list, the Summary List of Assessed Cases is added. This report 
     displays the total count of incomplete, complete and transmitted risk
     assessments and the count of excluded cases. This report may be 
     printed for all or for selected surgical specialties and for all 
     divisions or for a selected division.
     
 - M&M Verification Report [SRO M&M VERIFICATION REPORT] option
   This report is modified to display additional information as available,
   including the case number, final CPT codes and review of death comments.
   
 - Clostridium Difficile Colitis (C. difficile) definition updated
   o In the SURGERY file (#130), the description for the CLOSTRIDIUM
     DIFFICILE COLITIS field (#446) is updated.
   o In the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE CATEGORY file (#136.5), the 
     description for the CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS (C-DIFFICILE)
     category is updated.
     
 - In the SURGERY file (#130), the description for the PREOP FUNCT. HEALTH 
   STATUS field (#492) is updated.
  
 - Risk Model Lab Test (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB TEST EDIT] option
   This new option is added to the Surgery Risk Assessment Menu [SROA RISK
   ASSESSMENT] to assist the nurse reviewers in mapping entries in the 
   RISK MODEL LAB TEST file (#139.2) to the LAB DATA file (#63).
   
 - REGIONAL Anesthesia Technique added
   o REGIONAL is added to the list of choices when entering the ANESTHESIA
     TECHNIQUE field (#.37) in the SURGERY file (#130).
   o The Anesthesia AMIS [SROAMIS] option is inactivated and removed from
     the Anesthesia Menu [SROANES1] and from the Anesthesia Reports [SR
     ANESTH REPORTS] menu options.
     
 - Preoperative Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA PREOP DATA] option updated
   o The following items are no longer required and are removed from the
     input screens:
     > On Page 1, under GENERAL
       E. Pack/Years
       I. Pre-illness Funct Status
     > On Page 2, under CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
       H. Paraplegia 
       I. Quadriplegia
   o The following changes are made relating to the capture of height from
     the Vitals software:
     > The 1 year date range limitation is removed from the height capture 
       process so that the most recent height measurement is returned 
       regardless of when it was taken.
     > If the height capture process returns a height measurement from the 
       Vitals software, the date of the measurement will be stored and 
       displayed on the data input screen.
  
 - Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] option
   If the user responds YES to batch printing for a specific date range,
   the user will be allowed to print for a single surgical specialty or for
   all surgical specialties.
  
 - Surgery Consult Dates added
   The Patient Demographics (Enter/Edit) [SROA DEMOGRAPHICS] option is 
   updated to include 2 additional date fields:
   o Surgery Consult Date
   o Date Surgery Consult Requested
  
 Cardiac Assessment Modifications
 ------------------------------------
 - Clinical Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CLINICAL INFORMATION]
   The HEIGHT field (#236) and the WEIGHT field (#237) will no longer   
   accept an entry of NS for "No Study". System will only accept numeric
   values in the field.
  
 - Operative Risk Summary Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC OPERATIVE RISK]
   This option is modified to allow users to enter a value of NS (No Study)
   into the Physician's Preoperative Estimate of Operative Mortality field.
   Upon entry of NS, the system will automatically populate the Date/Time
   of Estimate of Operative Mortality field with a value of NS (No Study).
  
 - Update Assessment Status to 'COMPLETE' [SROA COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] 
   This option is modified to list items missing from the assessment based 
   upon the order in the field number in SURGERY file (#130). An
   enhancement to this option shall list missing items in the same order as
   the standard assessment screens.
  
 - Cardiac Procedures Operative Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC PROCEDURES]
   The system is modified to initially prompts user to "Select Operative 
   Information to Edit." A new entry of "N" shall allow the user to "Set
   All to No" for the 22 Cardiac Procedures fields. A verification prompt
   will follow to ensure that user understands entry.
   
   Fields that do not have YES/NO responses will be updated as follows:
     Items #1-#5 are numeric and their values will be set to 0.
     #9 Valve Repair will be set to NONE
     #13 Maze Procedure will be set to NO MAZE PERFORMED
  
 - Laboratory Test Results (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB-CARDIAC]
   If the lab values entered into the screen are out of range, they will be
   flagged as high or low during data entry.
  
 - Resource Data [SROA CARDIAC RESOURCE]
   o When editing the D/T PATIENT DISCH FROM ICU field (#471), the software
     is modified to provide the user with a select option to allow user to
     pull date/time from existing list of possible entries or manually
     enter a date/time
  
   o Postop Extubation Hours
     If the extubation time is entered, the software will display the 
     number of hours between the time the patient left the operating room 
     and the time the patient was extubated.
  
   o PRIMARY CAUSE FOR DELAY field (#515)
     If a Cardiac patient's surgery is greater than 30 days from initial VA
     Cardiothoracic Surgery Consultation (as calculated between the CT
     CONSULT DATE to DATE OF SURGERY), user is requested to enter cause as
     defined in the field. If date is less than or equal to 30 days, system
     shall automatically default entry to NONE.
  
  
 General Surgery Items
 ---------------------
 1. The following fields in the SURGERY file (#130) are updated to utilize 
    VistA Pharmacy supported API's in reference to the DRUG file (#50):
     - MEDICATIONS field (#.01, sub-file #130.33)
     - ANESTHESIA AGENTS field (#.01, sub-file #130.47 of sub-file #130.06)
     - TEST DOSE field (#.01, sub-file #130.48 of sub-file #130.06)
  
 2. Remedy Ticket #HD0000000203815
    When making an operation request, a site parameter controls whether 
    preoperative risk assessment information can be entered. If set to YES,
    there are occasions within two screens delete variables causing an
    undefined error. This patch fixes this problem.
  
 3. Remedy Ticket #HD0000000231157 
    The problem reported in this Remedy ticket is corrected by this patch.
    In the SURGERY file (#130), lookups on the DRUG file (#50) are modified
    to use only the GENERIC NAME field (#.01) and the SYNONYM field (#9).
   
 4. The following date/time fields in the SURGERY file (#130) are modified 
    to assume a past date if the user enters a date without a year:
    SURGICAL PRIORITY, DATE field (#414.1)
    HOSPITAL ADMISSION DATE field (#418)
    HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATE field (#419) 
    ADMISSION/TRANSFER DATE field (#420)
