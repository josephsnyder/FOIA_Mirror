Subject: CPT MODIFIER 51 SCREENING AND SERVICE BLOCK MODIFICATIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
   
 1. The Lexicon package has been working to update the CPT code ranges
 for the CPT Modifier 51 (MULTIPLE PROCEDURES). It has been determined 
 that CPT Modifier 51 should no longer be used in conjunction with the 
 Planned Principal Procedure Code (CPT). Restrictions will be placed on 
 the selection of CPT Modifier 51 when updating the Planned Principal 
 Procedure Code. 
  
 2. When a monthly service block is set for a day in the 4th week, users
 are unable to set a service block for that day in the 5th week of a month.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ==================== 
 1. HD0000000194156 - Input transform for CPT Modifier 51 in Surgery
   
 PROBLEM
 =======
 The Lexicon package has been working to update the CPT code ranges
 for the CPT Modifier 51 (MULTIPLE PROCEDURES). Part of this update
 is to include all Surgical Procedures and it was determined that the
 CPT Modifier 51 should not be used in conjunction with the Principal
 Procedure. It is recommended that restrictions be placed on the
 selection of Modifier 51 for the Principal Procedure.
   
 RESOLUTION
 ==========
 Routines SROMOD0 and SROMOD which screen the CPT Modifiers during data
 entry will be modified to prevent the selection or entry of the CPT
 Modifier 51.  Once this modification is installed, the user will not
 see the Modifier 51 (MULTIPLE PROCEDURES) as a selection.
   
 2. HD0000000238998 - FGH - service block issue on 5th week of month
   
 PROBLEM
 =======
 When a monthly service block is set for a day in the 4th week, users are
 unable to set a service block for that day in the 5th week of a month.
   
 RESOLUTION
 ==========
 The routines that add service blocks will be modified to look for days
 within date/time range that do not contain a service block. The routines
 that delete a service block will be modified to only delete the entered
 service block and leave any overlapping service blocks intact. If the
 service block being  deleted was entered before an overlapping service
 block, the overlapping service block will fill in the deleted date/time
 accordingly.
