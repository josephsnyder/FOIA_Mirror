Description:
============

 This patch provides the annual updates to the Veterans Health Information 
 Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Surgery package in support of
 the VA Surgery Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP). The updates include
 the addition of new data fields, changes to existing fields, changes to 
 data entry screens, changes to reports, and changes to the Surgery Risk 
 Assessment transmissions.
  
 Non-Cardiac Assessment Modifications:
 -------------------------------------
 - The frequency of transmission of 1-liner cases is changed from the 45th 
   day past the end of the quarter to the 45th day past the end of the
   month.
  
 - Patient gender is added to the information transmitted on 1-liner cases.
  
 - New fields added to SURGERY file (#130):
   o ASSESSMENT COMPLETED BY field (#272.1)
     When a non-cardiac assessment is completed, the user who completed the
     assessment will be identified in this field and the name of the user 
     will be transmitted with the assessment.
   o PREOPERATIVE SLEEP APNEA field (#237.1)
     This field is added to the Preoperative Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA
     PREOP DATA] option, the assessment printout, assessment transmission
     and the list of missing items functionality.
  
 - The SURGERY CONSULT DATE field (#513) and the SURGERY CONSULT REQUESTED 
   field (#516) are eliminated as non-cardiac assessment variables.
  
 - This patch updates the CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) with data for fiscal 
   year 2010.
  
 - Field descriptions are modified in the following fields in SURGERY file 
   (#130):

     The description and the input transform are modified.
   o WEIGHT field (#237)
     The description and the input transform are modified.

   o When selecting item #3, CPT Codes (view only), the following note is 
     added to the screen:
        CPT Codes should be verified. If need be, report discrepancies to
        the official CPT coder for surgery.
   o When selecting item #5, Concurrent Procedure, the following note is 
     added to the screen:
        Concurrent Procedure: An additional operative procedure performed
        by different surgical team (i.e., a different specialty/service)
        under the same anesthetic which has a CPT code different from that
        of the Principal Operative Procedure (e.g., fixation of a femur
        fracture in a patient undergoing a laparotomy for trauma). This
        field should be verified and, if need be, report discrepancies to
        the official CPT coder for surgery.
        
 - A new entry, N - NONE ASSIGNED, is added to the ASA CLASS file (#132.8).
