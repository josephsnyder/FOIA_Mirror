Description:
============

 This patch adds the Transplant Assessment module to the Surgery software. 
 This enhancement provides the ability to create assessments for lung,
 liver, kidney and heart transplants.
  
 A new menu, Transplant Assessment Menu [SR TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENT], is 
 added to the Surgery Menu [SROMENU] option. This new menu includes the
 following four options:
  
  (1) Enter/Edit Transplant Assessments [SR TRANSPLANT ENTER/EDIT]
      This option is used to enter and update the information required for 
      the transplant assessments. This option also allows the assessment 
      to be completed and transmitted.
  
  (2) Print Transplant Assessment [SRTP PRINT ASSESSMENT]
      This option is used to print a single Surgery Transplant Assessment.
  
  (3) List of Transplant Assessments [SRTP ASSESSMENT LIST]
      This option is used to print the List of Transplant Assessments. It 
      provides summary information for assessments within the sort 
      parameters selected.
  
  (4) Transplant Assessment Parameters (Enter/Edit) [SR TRANSPLANT 
      PARAMETER]
      This option is used to update local site parameters for the Surgery 
      Transplants Assessment module. Sites that are transplant centers must
      designate the types of organ transplants performed or assessed in
      order to streamline the transplant selection process when entering
      data.
  
 - The collected transplant assessments data will be stored in the SURGERY
   TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5).
  
 - Transplant Assessments Transmissions
   When editing an individual transplant assessment, upon leaving the   
   final page, the software allows the user to transmit the assessment to
   the national database.
  
   o The data of the non-cardiac transplant assessments (lung, liver, and
     kidney) will be transmitted to national NSQIP database in Chicago,
     Illinois.
  
   o The data of the heart transplant assessments (cardiac) will be 
     transmitted to national NSQIP database in Chicago, Illinois, as well 
     as to national CICSP database in Denver, Colorado.
  
 - Followup to patch SR*3*169
   This patch includes a pre-installation process that removes the
   following CPT codes from the CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) that were
   overlooked in the NSQIP - CPT EXCLUSION update patch for fiscal year
   2008 (SR*3*169).
   
    33945   TRANSPLANTATION OF HEART 
    47135   TRANSPLANTATION OF LIVER
    47136   TRANSPLANTATION OF LIVER
