 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  HD169056 - When using SROWAIT, not all providers are selectable for 
 REFERRING PHYSICIAN
  
  Problem:
  -------
  When selecting a referring physician, some valid entries in the NEW 
  PERSON file (#200) cannot be selected as referring physicians.  This was 
  due to differences between data requirements for file #200 and the
  Surgery Waiting List file (#133.8) or due to old data in the NEW PERSON
  file.
  
  Resolution:
  ---------- 
  Changes were made to the validation process to accept all data from the
  NEW PERSON file without evaluating it. Routine SROWL was modified.  The
  DR string set up to prompt for data originally had 3 slashes.  This was
  changed to 4 slashes for all but the STATE field (since this is a table
  lookup and translation.)
  
 2.  HD85957 - Retracted Addendum display in Operation Report 
  
  Problem:  
  -------
  When an addendum is entered and retracted for a surgery case and a user 
  with a classification that allows the viewing of retracted addendums 
  prints the Operation report there is no indicator on the report that the
  addendum has been retracted.
  
  Resolution:
  ----------
  Modified routine SROESPR1 to display the header "STATUS:" and the 
  current status of the addendum.
  
 3.  HD144569 - SRO - Surgery Only Reports
  
  Problem: 
  -------
  The Surgery Report (SR Health Summary component) and the Surgery Only
  Report (SRO Health Summary component) do not display the final codes for
  a surgery case if they differ from the information entered for Planned
  codes.
  
  Resolution:
  --------
  The Surgery Report and Surgery Only Report are both found in the Health 
  Summary package which uses DBIA 3590 to obtain the information required
  to display on these reports. The DBIA will be modified to return
  information stored in the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES FILE #136.
  This file contains the Final procedure codes entered for a surgery case, 
  field #.02 - PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE.
  
  The CODING COMPLETE field (#136,10) will be used to verify when the final
  CPT code should be displayed on the Surgery reports.
  
  A new array subcript will be created which will contain the information 
  stored in file #136, returning External and Internal values for each.
