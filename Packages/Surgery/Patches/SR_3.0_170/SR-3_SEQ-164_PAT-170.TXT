Description:
============

 This patch addresses one minor issue, updates the CPT Exclusion List for 
 NSQIP, and modifies a data element collected by NSQIP and CICSP. Each is 
 explained in more detail.
   
 1. The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) 
    stipulates that diagnostic codes, procedure codes, and terms used for
    billing purposes must be the codes and terms that were applicable at
    the time the service was provided.
  
    In October 2003, under the Code Set Versioning Project, the code names,
    descriptions, inactive flags and dates were replaced by versioned data
    elements, each with an effective date of use. Additionally, VA software
    packages who utilize the ICD/CPT files were provided with Code Set
    Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) to retrieve the new data and
    instructed to discontinue the use of the old un-versioned data 
    elements.
  
    This patch modifies the routine SROCMPED to make use of one of the Code
    Set APIs to retrieve and display versioned data.
  
 2. The CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) stores CPT codes that have been  
    identified by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 
    (NSQIP) as procedures that should not be risk assessed. This patch
    updates this file with data for fiscal year 2009.
  
 3. The lower range for HEIGHT field (#236) in the SURGERY file (#130)
    collected by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) 
    and Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP) has been
    lowered to account for post amputation height of patients with both
    legs amputated.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed during a period of low system activity 
 with Surgery users off the system. No options need to be placed out of 
 service. Installation time is expected to be less than 5 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 3. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*170):
  
    (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup
        any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
        you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
        installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
        templates, etc.).
  
    (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
  
    (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
        components of the KIDS build.
  
 4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*170.
  
 5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//"
    respond NO.
  
 6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu options, and
    Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 NOTE: This patch runs a post-installation process within the routine
       SR170UTL. This process removes the existing data in the CPT
       EXCLUSIONS file (#137) and populates the file with data for
       Fiscal year 2009.
  
 If routines SR170UT0 and SR170UTL are found on your system, they may be
 deleted upon completion of the installation. These routines are the
 post-install routines for this installation.
