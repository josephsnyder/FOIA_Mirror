Subject: Data issues WHEN USING THE NON-CARDIAC RISK ASSMNT INFO OPTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues:
 1.  The first issue addresses an UNDEFINED error that occurs when trying 
 to enter a DISCHARGE from POST ANESTHESIA CARE UNIT(DPACU) time that is
 earlier than the PATIENT IN ROOM (PIR) time even though the date is for
 the next day.  
 This occurs when using the OPERATION INFORMATION option of the NON-CARDIAC
 RISK ASSESSMENT INFORMATION.
  
 2.  When using the OPERATION INFORMATION option of the NON-CARDIAC
 RISK ASSESSMENT INFORMATION, an UNDEFINED error is being generated due to
 an expected variable not being set. This prevents users from being
 able to enter a PRINC. ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE for their patients.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000328417 Data Entry Error in Surgical Package
  
    Problem:

    enter a time for DISCHARGE FROM PACU (DPACU) that is earlier than the
    time entered for the PATIENT IN ROOM (PIR) in the OPERATION INFORMATION
    section of the option name NON-CARDIAC RISK ASSESSMENT INFORMATION
    because a variable is not being set correctly.
