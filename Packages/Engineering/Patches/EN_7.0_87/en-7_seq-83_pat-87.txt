Description:
============

 This patch adds a new top level menu and an edit option for IT personnel
 to view and update the non-expendable equipment inventory for IT
 equipment.  This patch allows IT staff to assign responsibility for IT 
 equipment to individuals and allows individuals to sign electronic hand 
 receipts for the assigned equipment.
  
  
 This patch makes the following functional changes to the Engineering 
 (AEMS/MERS) package.
  
 1. IDENTIFY CMR AS TRACKED IT CMR
  
    A new IT TRACKING (#6) field is added to the CMR (#6914.1) file.  If
    a YES is entered in this field, all equipment with that CMR value can
    be edited using the new option on the IT menu.  All this equipment will
    be expected to be assigned to individual IT owners.  It will be
    necessary to re-arrange CMRs if IT equipment that must be assigned to
    individuals (hand receipt) is mixed on a single CMR with other
    equipment that will not be assigned.  Please refer to current policy
    for the types of IT equipment that must be assigned to individuals.
  
    In support of the loan form functionality incorporated into the new
    hand receipt print options, fields DAYS BETWEEN RETURNS (#30) and LOAN
    FORM PHONE (#31) are also added to the CMR file.
  
    The CMR File Enter/Edit [ENCMR] option can be used by Acquisition &
    Materiel Management (A&MM) to edit the IT TRACKING, DAYS BETWEEN
    RETURNS, and LOAN FORM PHONE fields.
  
  
 2. NEW TOP LEVEL MENU FOR IT STAFF
  
    This patch adds a new top level menu, IT Equipment Module [ENIT MGR].
    This menu is intended for IT personnel.  The new options attached to
    this menu are described in later sections of the patch description.
    The menu contains the following options.
  
    Select IT Equipment Module Option: ??
  
    1      Inventory Edit (IT) [ENIT INVENTORY EDIT]
              **> Locked with EN IT INVENTORY
    2      Display Equipment Record [ENINVINV]
    3      Bar Code Features (NX Equipment) ... [ENMMBC]
    4      Specific Equipment History [ENIN-HIST-SPECIFIC]
    5      Display/Edit Room Data [ENSPROOMD]
    6      Non-Space File Location Report [ENIT NON-SPACE FILE LOC RPT]
    7      IT Equipment Responsibility ... [ENIT RESP MENU]
  
  
 3. NEW INVENTORY EDIT OPTION FOR IT
  
    This patch adds a new inventory edit option Inventory Edit (IT) [ENIT 
    INVENTORY EDIT].  This option is locked by a new security key EN IT 
    INVENTORY.  Only equipment with a CMR that has IT TRACKING set to YES
    can be edited with this option.
  
    The option allows editing of the following seven fields in the
    EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file.
  
      LOCATION                 - 
  
      NON-SPACE FILE LOCATION  - New field, See section 4 for details.
  
      IT REMOTE LOCATION       - New field.  Intended to hold information
                                 such as the address and phone number for
                                 IT equipment that is taken off site.
  
      CMR                      - Can not be deleted. Can only be changed to
                                 a CMR that also has IT TRACKING = YES.
  
      SERVICE POINTER          - (i.e. USING SERVICE)
  
      PHYSICIAL INVENTORY DATE - (i.e. LAST INVENTORIED) Can only be
                                 changed to the current date.
  
      IT COMMENTS              - New field.  Word processing.
  
  
 4. NON-SPACE FILE LOCATION FUNCTIONALITY
  
    This patch adds the NON-SPACE FILE LOCATION (#90) field to the
    EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file.  The purpose of this new field is to allow
    IT users to enter a free-text value when there is not a suitable
    location in the ENG SPACE (#6928) file to select.  The intention is
    that entry of a free-text location value will result in engineering
    automatically being notified via e-mail of the need for a new
    location.  After the new location is added to the ENG SPACE file, the
    engineering user can respond on the mail message that the location has
    been added and then the requester can use a new IT edit option to
    update the equipment location.  The system will automatically delete
    the NON-SPACE FILE LOCATION value when the LOCATION value is changed.
  
    This patch adds a new mail group EN NON-SPACE FILE LOC.  This mail 
    group automatically receives a message when a value is entered in the
    NON-SPACE FILE LOCATION field of the EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file.  The
    mail group is intended to have members that can add appropriate entries
    to the ENG SPACE (#6928) file based on the NON-SPACE FILE LOCATION
    value.
  
    This patch adds a new Non-Space File Location Report [ENIT NON-SPACE 
    FILE LOC RPT] option.  This report generates a list of equipment that 
    has a value in the NON-SPACE FILE LOCATION field. Ideally, equipment
    will not remain on this report for an extended period.  The report is
    attached to the new IT Equipment Module [ENIT MGR] menu and to the
    existing Space Management [ENSP1] menu.
  
  
 5. ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT EQUIPMENT
  
    All equipment on a CMR with IT TRACKING = YES should be assigned to a
    responsible individual.  Some sites may choose to assign shared IT
    equipment to more than one individual and this is supported by the
    software.
  
    Individuals will be notified during log on to VistA if they need to
    sign for any assigned IT equipment.  Individuals can electronically
    sign a hand receipt to accept responsibility.  Hand receipts must be 
    re-signed by the one year anniversary of the previous signature.
  
    The software also supports paper hand receipts for responsible 
    individuals that can not be given access to sign onto the computer.
  
    The hand receipt text is nationally standard text and will be updated
    (if necessary) via nationally issued patches to the Engineering
    package. For each version a checksum is calculated to detect and
    prevent unauthorized modifications.  
  
    This patch creates a new mail group EN IT EQUIPMENT. The software sends
    the following two types of messages to this mail group.
  
    A. A message will be sent to the mail group if the software 
       automatically terminates an assignment of responsibility.
       The software only terminates an assignment when the CMR (#19) field
       of the associated equipment item is either deleted or changed to a
       CMR that does not have IT TRACKING = YES.
  
    B. A message will be sent to the mail group when a user account is 
       terminated if that user has any active assignments of
       responsibility for IT equipment.  If appropriate, IT staff can
       then manually terminate or transfer the assignments.
  
  
 6. OPTIONS FOR IT STAFF TO ASSIGN AND MONITOR RESPONSIBILITY
  
    The IT Equipment Responsibility [ENIT RESP MENU] sub-menu is attached 
    to the new top level menu for IT staff.  This sub-menu contains the
    options to manage and report assignments of responsibility for IT
    equipment. 
  
    IT Equipment Responsibility...
        Assign Responsibility
          **> Locked with EN IT ASSIGNMENT
        Terminate Responsibility
          **> Locked with EN IT ASSIGNMENT
        Transfer Responsibility
          **> Locked with EN IT ASSIGNMENT
        Certify Hard Copy Signature
          **> Locked with EN IT ASSIGNMENT
        Print Hand Receipt for an Individual
        Add Entry to New Person File
          **> Locked with EN IT ASSIGNMENT
        IT Equipment Report Menu ...

            Unassigned IT Asset Report
            Assignments Pending Acceptance Report
            Tracked IT Assets Report
            Signature Exception Report
            Assignment Inquiry
  
    Brief descriptions of the options are shown below:
  
      'Assign Responsibility'     Option name: ENIT ASSIGN RESP
        Assign responsibility for IT equipment inventory items to 
        individuals.  Only equipment on a CMR that has IT TRACKING set to
        YES can be assigned.
  
      'Terminate Responsibility'     Option name: ENIT TERMINATE RESP
        This option enables the user to terminate one or more active
        responsibilities from a list of responsibilities based on an
        equipment item or a person.
  
      'Transfer Responsibility'     Option name: ENIT TRANSFER RESP
        This option terminates selected responsibilities and creates new
        responsibilities for equipment under another person.
  
      'Certify Hard Copy Signature'     Option name: ENIT CERTIFY RESP
        This option enables an IT person to certify that an assigned person
        has signed a hard copy hand receipt accepting responsibility for
        tracked IT equipment.  This option is expected to be used only when
        the assigned person does not have access to VistA in order to
        directly, electronically sign for the equipment.
  
      'Print Hand Receipt for an Individual'
       Option name: ENIT PRINT HAND RCPT (IT)
        This option enables IT personnel to print hard copy hand receipt
        for an individual.  The printout of an individual's signed, active
        assignments also serves as the loan form for Government Furnished
        IT Equipment.  The Equipment Return Date on the loan form is
        determined by adding the DAYS BETWEEN RETURNS value from the CMR
        file to the PHYSICAL INVENTORY DATE (i.e. Last Inventoried) of the
        equipment item.  A default of 90 days is used if a value is not
        specified for the applicable CMR.  If the equipment does not have
        an inventory date, the current date is reported as the equipment
        return date.
   
      'Add Entry to New Person File'     Option name: ENIT ADD NEW PERSON
        Add an entry to the NEW PERSON file.  A person should only be added
        with this option if that person will NOT be provided a user account
        to sign on the computer, but will be assigned responsibility for IT
        equipment.
  
      'IT Equipment Report Menu'     Option name: ENIT RESP RPT MENU
        Menu of IT equipment reports.
  
      'Individual Responsibility for IT Assets Report'
       Option name: ENIT INDV RESP RPT (IT)
        Report of all IT equipment currently assigned to a specific
        responsible individual.
  
      'Unassigned IT Asset Report'
       Option name: ENIT RESP NOT ASSIGNED RPT
        Report of tracked IT Assets that are not currently assigned to a 
        responsible individual.  Assets are considered to be tracked IT 
        assets if their CMR value has IT TRACKING set to YES.
  
      'Assignments Pending Acceptance Report'
       Option name: ENIT RESP UNSIGNED RPT
        Report of equipment with IT assignments that have not yet been 
        signed.
  
      'Tracked IT Assets Report'     Option name: ENIT EQUIP RPT
        Report of equipment inventory that has a CMR value with IT TRACKING
        equal to YES.  The report can be run for specific equipment, groups
        of equipment, or all tracked IT equipment.
    
      'Signature Exception Report'     Option name: ENIT SIGN EXCEPT RPT
        Report assignments of IT responsibility with the most recent 
        signature at least one year old as of a user specified date.
  
      'Assignment Inquiry'     Option name: ENIT ASSIGN INQ (IT)
        Inquiry to an assignment of responsibility for IT equipment.
  
  
 7. OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS ASSIGNED RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT EQUIPMENT
  
    A new IT Owner Menu [ENIT OWNER MENU] contains the options intended for
    any individual that could be assigned responsibility for IT equipment.
  
    IT Owner Menu...
        Accept IT Responsibility
        Individual Responsibility for IT Assets Report
        Print My Hand Receipt
        Assignment Inquiry
  
    Brief descriptions of the options attached to this menu are show below:
  
      'Accept IT Responsibility'     Option name: ENIT RESP SIGN
        The user will accept responsibility for assigned IT equipment by
        this option.  This option allows a user to sign to reaffirm the
        acceptance, as well as, enter the initial acceptance.
  
       'Individual Responsibility for IT Assets Report'
        Option name: ENIT INDV RESP RPT (COM)
         Report of all IT equipment currently assigned to the user.
  
       'Print My Hand Receipt'     Option name: ENIT PRINT HAND RCPT (COM)
         This option enables the user to print hand receipts for IT items 
         assigned to the user.  The printout of an individual's signed,
         active assignments also serves as the loan form for Government
         Furnished IT Equipment.  The Equipment Return Date on the loan
         form is determined by adding the DAYS BETWEEN RETURNS value from
         the CMR file to the PHYSICAL INVENTORY DATE (i.e. Last
         Inventoried) of the equipment item.  A default of 90 days is used
         if a value is not specified for the applicable CMR.  If the
         equipment does not have an inventory date, the current date is
         reported as the equipment return date.
  
       'Assignment Inquiry'     Option name: ENIT ASSIGN INQ (COM)
         Inquiry to an assignment of responsibility for IT equipment.  Only
         assignments for the user can be selected.
