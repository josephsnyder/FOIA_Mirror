Subject: Multiple Individuals on Hand Receipt prints

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The Print Hand Receipt for an Individual report lists people who do not 
 actually have the equipment assigned to them.  The problem is that the
 utility being used also includes assignments that partially match the
 search criteria. For example, a search for active assignments for a person
 with internal entry number 100 will also include any active assignments
 for other persons whose internal entry number starts with 100 such as
 1001, 10025 etc.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000258583 - Multiple Ind on Hand Receipt prints
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Several sites have reported that the Print Hand Receipt for an Individual
 [ENIT PRINT HAND RCPT (IT)] option listed more than one individual with
 equipment on hand receipt.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 There are 9 calls to FIND^DIC(6916.3 in routines ENTIRC, ENTIRRH, ENTIRT,
 ENTIRX and ENTIUTL. These calls are searching a couple of cross-references
 ("AEA" and new "AOA2") for the active IT assignments associated with a
 specific equipment item or specific owner. These calls in those routines
 have been modified to include "X" in the flag so only exact matches are
 returned by the API.
  
 The new cross-reference "AOA2" associated with the owner will be set up
 by the routine ENTIP89 during a post initialization. The routine ENTIP89
 will be deleted by KIDS upon completion of the post initialization.
