Subject: DATE OF DEATH BULLETINS/EXCEPTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*8, RG*1.0*19, RG*1.0*45, RG*1.0*48, RG*1.0*49, and
  RG*1.0*50 are required builds for patch RG*1*52.
    
  The Master Patient Index (MPI) is currently not the authoritative
  source for patient Date of Death information.  Therefore, Identity
  Management Data Quality (IMDQ) has determined that all bulletins
  and exceptions related to Date of Death generated from the Master
  Patient Index functionality should no longer be sent to the sites,
  to ensure that inaccurate information is not propagated.
   
  At the direction of Identity Management Data Quality (IMDQ), the
  following VistA changes have been incorporated in patch RG*1*52.
    
  Issue #1 - Remove Remote Date of Death Indicated messages.
  The Remote Date of Death Indicated messages that VAMCs have been
  receiving from the MPI/PD PACKAGE in the past will be discontinued.
  Routines: RGADTP2, RGRSPT, RGRSBUL1
   
  Issue #2 - Remove three obsolete Date of Death exceptions.
  The following exceptions in the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION
  HANDLING] option are obsolete and will no longer occur:
  215 - Death Entry on MPI not VISTA,
  216 - Death Entry on Vista not MPI, and
  217 - Death Entries on MPI and Vista DON'T MATCH.
  Code references to these exception types have been eliminated.
  Routines: RGEX01, RGEXHND1, RGHLLOG, RGMTETOT, RGSYSTAT, RGEVPRG
   
  - NOTE: Routine RGSYSTAT contained code references to the Date of
  Death exceptions which have been removed.  That routine produces the
  Unresolved Exception Summary [RG STATUS DISPLAY] report.  The report
  also included obsolete references to Patient Data Review and CMOR
  Requests Status.  That obsolete data has been removed from the report
  as well.  (Patient Data Review was retired as of patch RG*1*49, and
  the CMOR Request functionality was removed in patch MPIF*1*44.)
   
  Issue #3 - Mark obsolete Date of Death exceptions as processed.
  A post-init routine will examine the NOT PROCESSED exceptions in
  the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option.
  If there are any NOT PROCESSED exceptions for the following
  exception types, they will be marked as PROCESSED, since these
  types are now obsolete:
  215 - Death Entry on MPI not VISTA,
  216 - Death Entry on Vista not MPI, and
  217 - Death Entries on MPI and Vista DON'T MATCH.
  Routine: RGP52PST
    
  - NOTE: Option MPI/PD Patient Admin User Menu [RG ADMIN USER MENU]
  was distributed with patch RG*1.0*49 (released 4/10/08) as obsolete
  with an Out of Order message.  That option is being distributed in
  this build as DELETE AT SITE in order to remove it from the menu
  structure.  There are other MPI/PD options in the MPIF* and VAFC*
  namespaces that are also obsolete that will be removed in future
  MPIF* and DG* patches.
    
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patch RG*1.0*52.
  Facilities should download the revised documentation listed as
  follows:
    
      User Manual                         RG1_0_UM.PDF
      Release Notes                       RG1_0_RN.PDF
      Technical Manual                    RG1_0_TM.PDF
      Exception Handling                  RG1_0_EH.PDF
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.

  ==============================
  Some exceptions in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file will be
  marked as processed by the post-init routine RGP52PST.  The following
  existing active exception types will be retired.
      - 215 - Death Entry on MPI not VISTA,
      - 216 - Death Entry on Vista not MPI, and
      - 217 - Death Entries on MPI and Vista DON'T MATCH.
  Routine RGP52PST will be automatically deleted from your system
  after successful installation of the patch.
       
  Installation Instructions:

      Start, Stop Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and
      Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the
      HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
     
  3.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
