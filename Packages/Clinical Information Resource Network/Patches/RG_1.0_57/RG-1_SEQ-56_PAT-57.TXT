Subject: REMOVE POTENTIAL MATCHES RETURNED EXCEPTION REFERENCES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*52 and RG*1.0*54 are required builds for patch RG*1*57.
   
  The Potential Matches Returned (218) exceptions in the VistA MPI/PD
  Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option are obsolete.
  As of VistA patch MPIF*1*52, the logging of Potential Matches
  Returned exceptions was removed from the VistA HL7 message processor
  routines.  Although the exceptions no longer occur, some references
  remained that will be cleaned up in this patch.
     
  Issue #1:
  Upon log in, members of the RG CIRN DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES Mail Group
  see a notification regarding exceptions to process.  Previously,
  two different notifications existed.  Since only one exception type
  (234 - Primary View Reject) remains in the MPI/PD Exception Handling
  [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option, only one notification is needed. 
  This was reported in Remedy Ticket HD0000000383093.
   
  Issue #2:
  In the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option,
  after choosing an exception, "PMR Potential Match Rev" was displayed
  as one of the selectable actions at the bottom of the screen.  This
  action item has been removed.
   
  Issue #3:
  Post-init routine, RGP57PST, will examine the NOT PROCESSED exceptions
  listed under the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING]
  option.  If there are any NOT PROCESSED exceptions for exception type
  Potential Matches Returned (218), they will be marked as PROCESSED,
  since this type is obsolete.
   
  Some code references to the Potential Matches Returned (218)
  exception type are not obvious to the user, as they are involved
  in behind-the-scenes processing.  Those references have also been
  cleaned up.  The Potential Matches Returned (218) entry in the CIRN
  HL7 EXCEPTION TYPE (#991.11) file remains, but is no longer used.
     
  Issue #4:
  Remedy Ticket HD0000000224941 reported the following problem.
  After selecting an exception in the VistA MPI/PD Exception
  Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option, and choosing the UPD
  Update to Processed action item, the user observed an unexpected
  result when taking the default answer to the prompt, "Are you
  sure you want to change the status? YES//".  After answering YES,
  the user saw "??" (two question marks) displayed, which caused
  questions about whether or not the answer was processed correctly.
  The next screen of the VistA MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG
  EXCEPTION HANDLING] option indicated that the exception was
  processed.  However, upon further investigation, it was found
  that the WHO MARKED PROCESSED (#8) field in the EXCEPTION (#2)
  multiple of the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file was not
  updated with the user name.
     
  When the above sequence of actions is taken, the code should store the
  DUZ (internal entry number) of the user into the WHO MARKED PROCESS
  (#8) field.  If by chance, the user has a 4 digit DUZ and there are
  other users on the system who have those same 4 digits as the last four
  digits of their Social Security Numbers, then FileMan's lookup by
  cross-reference does not know which entry to file into the field.
  This issue has been corrected in routine RGEX03.
     
  Because enhancements are being made to the MPI/PD Exception Handling
  [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option, ALL of the related protocols are
  included in the build to ensure that this List Manager application
  exports correctly.
   
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patch RG*1.0*57.
  Facilities should download the revised documentation listed
  as follows:
  
      Exception Handling                  RG1_0_P57EH.PDF
      User Manual                         RG1_0_P57UM.PDF
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.

  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  The logging of Potential Matches Returned (218) exceptions was
  removed from the VistA HL7 message processor routines in VistA
  patch MPIF*1*52 which was released on Nov 30, 2009.  Any Potential
  Matches Returned exceptions remaining in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION
  LOG (#991.1) file will be marked as processed by post-init routine
  RGP57PST.
   
  Routine RGP57PST will be automatically deleted from your system
  after successful installation of the patch.
