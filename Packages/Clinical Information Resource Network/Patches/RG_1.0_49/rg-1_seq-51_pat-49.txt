Subject: DISABLE PATIENT DATA REVIEW (PDR)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  This patch will retire the Patient Data Review (PDR) functionality.
  
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*48 and DG*5.3*766 are required builds for patch RG*1*49.
  
  ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET:
  =========================

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1) HD204680 - PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE]: HAS AT THE END OF NUMBER ~PRN~PH
  
  Problem:
  ========
  While processing the IVM UPLOAD, site noted patients in the Patient 
  file that have ~PRN~PH at the end of the PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] (field
  #.131).
  
  The issue is that the site is getting a PDR to review and accept which 
  has a PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] value difference and from the PDR view it 
  looks fine.  However when it is accepted, it is stored with the HL7 
  message formatting "~PRN~PH" tacked on. 
  
  Solution:
  =========
  This opportunity is taken to disable the Patient Data Review (PDR)
  functionality because Primary View Initialization concluded on
  September 10.  The below option is being marked obsolete by 
  this patch:
  
      MPI/PD Patient Admin User Menu [RG ADMIN USER MENU]
  
  Routine RGADTP2 is also being modified to prevent creating new PDR's.
  
  
  Additional options and files are being disabled by DG*5.3*766.
  
  When this patch and DG*5.3*766 have been installed at all sites, 
  an additional patch will be issued that will provide a list of 
  the patient records whose phone numbers require repair. 
  Remedy ticket HD0000000243664 was opened to track this. The repairs 
  will need to be done manually as the field is free text and can 
  also contain characters other than ~PRN~PH,and can contain multiple
  phone numbers and multiple sets of appended characters.
  Here is one example of what the data could look like coming in:
  
  (###)###-####~PRN~PH|(###)###-####~WPN~PH
  
  In this example the PRN number (along with everything else left of the 
  bar) would have been stored.  If the PRN number wasn't defined the WPN 
  would then probably get stored in the Home Phone #.
  
 DOCUMENTATION DISTRIBUTION:
 ===========================
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly via FTP (using BIN mode).  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany:                 ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    anonymous.software
  Hines:                  ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City:         ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       anonymous.software
  FIRST AVAILABLE SERVER  download.vista.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
  
 Filename                    Description
