Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENT - DATE OF DEATH UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems or the FORUM CLAIMS system (since it is NOT a
       Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) VistA system).
  
 RG*1.0*71 is the ONLY required build for patch RG*1.0*73.
        
 NOTE: Do NOT install RG*1.0*73 on legacy systems or on the
       FORUM CLAIMS system.
    
 The following enhancement exported in this patch was requested by
 the Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) business office and will
 allow Date of Death (DOD) meta data to be updated when the existing
 DOD and the incoming DOD are the same.
  
 Enhancement
 The Admit Discharge Transfer (ADT) update person information (A31)
 Health Level Seven (HL7) message processing code in routine RGADTP3
 has been modified to allow DOD meta data to now be updated even if the
 existing DOD is the same as the transmitted DOD for the patient record.
