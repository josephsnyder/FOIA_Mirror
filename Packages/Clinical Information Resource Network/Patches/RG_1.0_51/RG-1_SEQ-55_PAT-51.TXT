Subject: IDENTITY MANAGEMENT ISSUES FOR HDR II / CDS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*51 and RG*1.0*36 are required builds for patch RG*1*51.
   
  Issue #1:
  On VistA, the VistA Duplicate Resolution System [XDR MAIN MENU] is used
  to merge duplicate patient records.  When two patient records are merged,
  and each has a national ICN, DFN, and Station Number, the final result
  currently is the deletion of one DFN and Station Number and deprecation
  of one ICN on the Master Patient Index (MPI).  Since the MPI is the
  authoritative store for VistA national identifiers for the Health Data
  Repository (HDR), this scenario orphans the deleted DFN and Station
  Number for HDR. This problem will be corrected by retaining the
  information about the deprecated DFN and Station Number on the MPI.
   
  A change has been made in the VistA processing routine, RGDRM01.  The
  code will now send the A40 merge message to the MPI after a duplicate
  record merge, regardless of whether the merging patient records do or do
  not have national ICNs. The MPI will store this information and send it
  to Person Service Identity Management (PSIM) when there is an ICN
  involved, which will store it in the Administrative Data Repository
  (ADR), which in turn will make it available to HDR.
