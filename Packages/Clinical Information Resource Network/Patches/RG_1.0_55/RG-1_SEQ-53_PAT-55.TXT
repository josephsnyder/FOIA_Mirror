   REMEDY OVERVIEW:
   ================
   1) HD0000000127163 - Remote patient data query option
   
   Problem:
   ========
   Using Remote Patient Data Query Menu [RG REMOTE PDAT MENU] if users
   receive an error from one site and go to send from all sites, all 
   sites will display an error. 
   
   Solution:
   =========
   Routine RGRPDAT will be changed to kill variables STATUS,RETURN 
   and RESULT that are being left over when display is complete.
  
   
   2) HD0000000309551 - Treating sites for Remote Patient Data Query Menu 
                        showing OTHER sites    
   Problem:
   ========
   The list of Treating sites displayed using the Remote Patient Data Query
   Menu [RG REMOTE PDAT MENU] include sites that don't treat patients.
   
   Solution:
   =========
   Routine RGRPDAT will be changed to exclude sites in the Treating 
   Facility List file (#391.91) that have OTHER listed as the type in the
   display. 
  
  
   3) HD0000000243664 - Follow up to patch RG*1*49  - Need report of
                        invalid phone numbers.
  
   Problem:
   =======
   Invalid phone numbers in the following format: (123)456-9999~PRN~PH, 
   were entered in the PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] field (#.131) of the
   Patient file (#2) before patch RG*1*49 retired the Patient Data Review
   function. Sites need to have a report to determine if they have invalid
   data in their files so they will be able to correct them.
  
   Solution:
   ========
   Routine RG1P55 will run and send a mailman message to the person 
   installing the patch that will give the DFN and phone number of any 
   record that may need to be corrected.  If the mailman message has any 
   patients listed, the installer should forward the message onto the ADPAC
   of the site so that they can correct the phone numbers using Load/Edit
   Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]. The message will look like the
   following:
