Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v27.  CPRS GUI 
 version 27 consists of two host files:  OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID and 
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID.  These two host files contain software 
 patches that support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  The host files were 
 created to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
 facilities.  Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.27 and Associated Patches 
 Installation Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document
 is exported as OR_30_243IG.doc and OR_30_243IG.pdf and is included in 
 OR_30_243.ZIP.  
  
 No additional installation or set-up steps specific to WV*1.0*23 are
 required once the software is installed.
  
 OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID includes the CPRS and Pharmacy patches required for 
 CPRS GUI v27.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 OR*3*243
 PSJ*5*134
 PSO*7*225
  
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID includes the related and required patches 
 needed to support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  It includes builds for the 
 following patches:
 GMRA*4*38
 GMPL*2*35
 GMTS*2.7*80
 LR*5.2*365
 TIU*1*219
 WV*1*23
  
 Installation of the two CPRS host files should be coordinated among the 
 packages affected since these host files will install the majority of the 
 software needed to implement CPRS GUI v27.
  
 This patch contains changes to support the alert processing enhancement
 feature as recommended by the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
 Clinical Workgroup in resolving PSI-06-068 & PSI-07-014 and its duplicates
 (see list below). At the Workgroup's request, it was recommended to modify
 the below existing informational alerts to action alerts that will direct
 the user to the associated report under the Clinical Reports section of
 the reports tab upon processing.
  
 #69 - Mammogram Results (File #100.9)
 #70 - Pap Smear Results (File #100.9)
 #71 - Anatomic Pathology Results (File #100.9)
  
 Currently, no supporting data is passed in as a parameter when the Pap 
 Smear & Mammogram alerts are generated in the Women's Health (WH) package.
 This patch will supply the identifier data needed by the CPRS Graphical 
 User Interface (GUI) and List Manager in order to accommodate for this
 enhancement feature.
