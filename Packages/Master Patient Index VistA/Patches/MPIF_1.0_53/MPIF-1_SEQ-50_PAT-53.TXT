Subject: REMOVE POTENTIAL MATCHES RETURNED EXCEPTION REFERENCES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*48 and RG*1.0*57 are required builds for patch MPIF*1*53.
   
  The Potential Matches Returned (218) exceptions in the VistA MPI/PD
  Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option are obsolete.
  As of VistA patch MPIF*1*52, the logging of Potential Matches
  Returned exceptions was removed from the VistA HL7 message processor
  routines.  Although the exceptions no longer occur, some references
  remained that will be cleaned up in this patch.
   
  Issue #1
  A number of references to the Potential Matches Returned (218)
  exception type have been commented out or are in modules that are
  no longer being called since patch MPIF*1*52 was released.  Those
  references are removed in routines MPIFBT2, MPIFDUP, and MPIFQ3.
