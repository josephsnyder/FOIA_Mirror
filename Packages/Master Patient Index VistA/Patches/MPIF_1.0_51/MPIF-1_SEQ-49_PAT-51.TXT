Subject: IDENTITY MANAGEMENT ISSUES FOR HDR II / CDS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*41 and MPIF*1.0*44 are required builds for patch MPIF*1*51.
   
  Issue #1:
  On VistA, the VistA Duplicate Resolution System [XDR MAIN MENU] is used
  to merge duplicate patient records.  When two patient records are merged,
  and each has a national ICN, DFN, and Station Number, the final result
  currently is the deletion of one DFN and Station Number and deprecation
  of one ICN on the Master Patient Index (MPI).  Since the MPI is the
  authoritative store for VistA national identifiers for the Health Data
  Repository (HDR), this scenario orphans the deleted DFN and Station
  Number for HDR. This problem will be corrected by retaining the
  information about the deprecated DFN and Station Number on the MPI.
   
  A change has been made in routine MPIFA40, which is called by the VistA 
  processing routine, RGDRM01.  Previously, the A40 merge notification 
  message was not triggered unless both merging patient records had a
  national ICN. The code will now send the A40 merge message to the MPI
  after a duplicate record merge, regardless of whether the merging 
  patient records do or do not have national ICNs. The MPI will store this
  information and send it to Person Service Identity Management (PSIM) 
  when there is an ICN involved, which will store it in the
  Administrative Data Repository (ADR), which in turn will make it
  available to HDR.
  Routine: MPIFA40
   
  Issue #2:
  The Health Data Repository (HDR) relies on the Master Patient Index
  (MPI) and Person Service Identity Management (PSIM) to provide
  national and correlated identifiers for patients.  The MPI does
  not currently have data for patient records previously merged into
  other patient records.
   
  Post-init routine, MPIF51P, will examine the records in the XDR 
  REPOINTED ENTRY (#15.3) file.  For the PATIENT (#2) file entries, data 
  will be extracted for the MERGED ENTRY (#.01) and MERGED TO ENTRY (#.02) 
  fields.  This data will be sent in A24 HL7 messages to the MPI to update 
  PSIM and the Administrative Data Repository (ADR), making it available 
  to HDR.
  
  Occasionally a pair of PATIENT (#2) file entries are merged, then
  later a merged-to entry is merged into a third DFN.  If the first
  merge-to record is now a merge-from record having a -9 node, then
  the current primary DFN for the pair is found in the XDR REPOINTED
  ENTRY (#15.3) file.

  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  Post-init routine, MPIF51P, will be queued to run in the background.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch takes less than 2 minutes to install.  This patch should
  be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.
   
     IMPORTANT NOTE: Patch MPIF*1*51 should be installed when NO
                     duplicate record merges are scheduled.
   
  Patch RG*1*51 can be installed immediately after the patch
  MPIF*1*51 installation.  It is not necessary to wait for the
  MPIF*1*51 post-init routine to run to completion.
   
  1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
     
  2.  The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor,
      Start, Stop Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and
      Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the
      HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
     
  3.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
      Note:  TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display
      the patch text only.
     
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  5.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global.
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System.
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global.
      (d)  Print Transport Global.
   
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPIF*1.0*51.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? NO//', respond NO.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
      respond NO.
   
  9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  The following OPTIONS should be
      disabled during the installation.
      Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
      Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
      MPI/PD Master Menu              [RGMGR]
      Duplicate Resolution System     [XDR MAIN MENU]
      
  10. After patch installation has completed, restart the HL7 incoming
      filers.  Use the Monitor, Start, Stop Filers [HL FILER MONITOR]
      option on the Filer and Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER 
      LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
   
  11. Post-init routine, MPIF51P, will be queued to run in the
      background.  When the task has successfully run to completion, the
      person installing the patch will be notified via an e-mail message.
      Upon notification, the routine can be deleted from your system.
