Subject: VISTA APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT OED UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Applications are being developed to work in a LINUX/VMS environment.
 The development team found that routines ECCRPC and ECFLRPS for Event
 Capture have to be changed in order to work in a mixed environment.
 This patch modifies routines ECCRPC and ECFLRPC so that can occur.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =================
 HD0000000277362:       VistA Application Development OED
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 Sites are not currently set up to be able to function on a production 
 platform other than a cluster of multiple Virtual Memory System 
 (VMS)-based servers or a client/server model running both data and 
 application servers on VMS.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch modifies routines ECCRPC and ECFLRPC in order to work in a
 mixed Operating System environment.
  
 Installing this patch will change the scratch directory used by the Event 
 Capture (EC) package to the default Kernel Host File System (HFS)
 directory instead of the value stored in the Division Parameter, "EC HFS
 SCRATCH".
  
 That division parameter is stored in the PARAMETERS (#8989.5) file which
 is currently being used.
  
 The kernel parameter is stored in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS (#8989.3) 
 file.
  
 The EC HFS SCRATCH parameter is no longer going to be used and the scratch
 directory will default to the directory set in the KERNEL SYSTEM
 PARAMETERS (#8989.3) file.  This will enable the package to function the 
 same regardless of the type of platform VistA uses.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be run after normal business hours.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
     2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
     3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*101)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
     4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package EC*2.0*101.
  
     5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        NO//" respond NO.
  
     6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
        and Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
