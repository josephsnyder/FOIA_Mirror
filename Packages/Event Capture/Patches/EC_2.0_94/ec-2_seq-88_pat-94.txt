 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1). HD0000000185272 - Problem with GUI Interface for User With One DSS
                       Unit
     Duplicates:
     HD0000000202984 - The ADD button cannot be selected unless clicking on
                       the window.
     HD0000000185326 - "ADD" button grayed out for user with only 1 DSS
                       unit
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Problem with GUI Interface for User With One Decision Support System (DSS)
 Unit. The user reports that one Event Capture (EC) GUI User only has one
 DSS UNIT assigned and the ADD button is grayed out. The only way she can
 get the Add Button available is to select the Calendar for the Through
 Date and actually select today's date. After this is done, the Add Button
 is active and can be used.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 EC GUI procedure TfrmPatientProcDE.FormCreate was modified so that the ADD
 button is not grayed out when one DSS UNIT is assigned.
  
 2). HD0000000203858 - In Manager Menu, go into Add/Update Categories,
                       error encountered "09@15:33:17" is not a valid
                       integer value.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In Manager Menu, go into Add/Update Categories, error encountered 
 "09@15:33:17" is not a valid integer value.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ECUMRPC1 was modified to correct the invalid integer value error 
 message that is encountered during the Add/Update Categories option.
  
 3). HD0000000205515 - User says procedure name should be blank with no 
                       associated clinic
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When event screen is set up with no associated clinic and user clicks
 data entry the first clinic listed in the drop down box is shown in the
 associated clinic field automatically. The field should be blank until
 user selects from the drop down box. By the box not being blank, users
 accept the default assuming it was sent up in event code screen like other
 screens.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 EC GUI procedure TfrmEditPatientProc.GetProcedureDefaults was modified to 
 correct the associated clinic field from automatically defaulting the 
 first clinic listed in the drop down box when no associated clinic has been
 defined for the DSS Unit.
  
  
 4). HD0000000200198 - CPT mod GP not crossing to VISTA for proc codes
                       97100+
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The CPT modifier GP for rehab visits is not crossing over into VISTA.  It 
 appears to be accepted on the EC screen, but when closing then clicking on the 
 visit, the modifier does not show in the "selected" box.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ECUURPC was modified so that all modifiers in the selected box will be 
 saved in VISTA.
  
  
 5). HD0000000205587 - Volume Errors in EC 
     Duplicate:
     HD0000000216086 - EC PROVIDER SUMMARY DISPLAY WRONG VOL
     HD0000000226080 - LIT - error in Nightly Data Feed to PCE 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The ENTER/EDIT PATIENT PROCEDURE Displays the wrong volume number for some 
 patients. The maximum number is 99 but displays numbers 6549, 6550 etc. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The EC GUI procedure TfrmEditProcPatients2.spinVolumeExit was modified to
 prevent the volume value from storing a value greater than 99. 
  
  
 6). HD0000000194922 - DSS Workload Report not giving the correct count
                       for Marion Division DSS Unit - whether it is an
                       individual location or All.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 DSS Workload Report not giving the correct count for DSS Unit whether it is 
 an individual location or All .
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ECRRPT was modified to correct the count for a given DSS Unit on the 
 DSS Unit Workload Report.
