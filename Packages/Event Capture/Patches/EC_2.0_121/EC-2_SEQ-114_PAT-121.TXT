 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW: 
 =======================
 1) INC000000883477 Event Capture - Other
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    When entering Event Capture and running screen reader software, the
    user is receiving an error message. The message is stating that the
    eligibility code is required, while none are available for selection,
    and the user cannot proceed with saving their record. The required 
    field prompt has issues when the Combo Box is enabled. In patch
    EC*2.0*119 an update was made so that if a screen reader was running,
    some controls on forms were changed so that they could be read
    correctly. This change caused this error.
  
    Solution: 
    ---------
    The GUI has been updated (specifically the Edit Patient Procedure form)
    so that the Eligibility Code Combo box is not enabled unless there are
    codes available for selection.
