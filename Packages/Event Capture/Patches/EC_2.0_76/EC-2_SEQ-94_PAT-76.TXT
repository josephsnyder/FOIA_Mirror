Subject: EVC R2 EVENT CAPTURE LEGACY & GUI VISTA CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) project has being undertaken to support
 technology and business changes that are occurring with the implementation
 of the Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) project.  Some modified and new 
 business functionality is being included in the new system and
 corresponding changes are necessary in VistA for preliminary determination
 of veterans Enrollment and Eligibility status. The overall objective is to
 achieve a National release of software from both projects simultaneously.
     
 This patch distributes the changes to the Event Capture System (ECS) in 
 support of the this initiative.
  
   
 ADD SHIPBOARD HAZARD AND DEFENSE (PROJECT 112/SHAD) & RENAME ENVIRONMENTAL  
 CONTAMINANTS CLASSIFICATIONS
 I. Overview
  
  A. This patch updates EVENT CAPTURE v2.0 to handle the new classification, 
     Project 112/SHAD.  
       
     1. The following patch must be installed in order for the Project 
        112/SHAD classification to function correctly: SD*5.3*441. 
        A 'Yes' or 'No' response will be indicated when a 
        procedure event is related to a Project 112/SHAD.  The option that 
        will be affected by this installation is EVENT CAPTURE DATA ENTRY.
  
  B. Additionally, as part of this project the description for the 
     classification "Environmental Contaminants" will be changed to 
     "SW Asia Conditions".
  
   
 II. Functional
  
   If a veteran has reported having been exposed to Shipboard Hazard and 
   Defense (Project 112/SHAD), then the Event Capture software will ask the 
   user to indicate if the procedure is related to Project 112/SHAD.  The 
   system will prompt the user with 'Was treatment related to Project 
   112/SHAD?'.  The user can then choose to respond with Y-Yes or N-No.
  
   This change affects three ECS GUI data entry options.
  
     ECS GUI options
       Data Entry by Patient
       Data Entry by Procedure
       Data Entry by Multiple Patients/Procedures
  
  
 III. Technical
  
   o A new field, PROJECT 112/SHAD (#41) was added to the EVENT CAPTURE
     PATIENT file (#721) to capture the classification for Project 112/SHAD.
     The data is stored at "P;12" - the 11th piece of the P node.
  
   o The 21st piece of the PCE DATA FEED field (#30) now contains the
     Project 112/SHAD.  The Technical description of this field was
     updated to list each piece of data that comprise the PCE data feed.
  
   o Seventeen (17) routines and two (2) input templates were modified. The
     templates EC CREATE PATIENT ENTRY and EC FILE PCE NODE are used
     within ListMan for filing the 'P' and 'PCE' nodes in the EVENT CAPTURE 
     PATIENT file (#721).
  
   o Delphi routines 'UfrmEditPatientProc', 'UfrmEditProcPatients' and
     'UfrmMultiple' were modified to add the new classification in ECS GUI.
   
    o Menu option EC GUI Context version 2.1.1.0 was changed to update
      the version to 2.1.2.1.

 ********************* INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************************
  
 Pre-Installation Items:
 =======================
  
 * Users On the System:
    
     This patch modifies routines used by the Event Capture application and
     may affect many users.
  
     This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be
     loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users and to
     reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are updated.
  
     If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
     following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
     descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
     the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
           EC GUI Context version 2.1.1.0   ... EC GUI CONTEXT
    
 * Software Installation Time:
  
     The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off peak
     hours.
  
 * Required Builds:
    
     The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS
     distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
     without their prior installation.
  
     Required Build(s):
     ------------------
