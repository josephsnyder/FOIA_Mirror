     Problem:
     --------
     A request was made to update the VistA Event Capture EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE (#725) file.
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The changes were submitted by the Bedford Technical Services
     Office (BTSO) Decision Support Services (DSS) Program Office to be
     implemented upon release of the patch. This patch updates the EC
     NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file by modifying 8 description (NAME)
     (#.01) fields and adding 2 new procedure records.
  
 Note: The new EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE Numbers could exist in some sites'
 environments. If the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE Numbers exist then the system
 will add the new numbers and it will keep what the sites have on file. 
  
 In addition, a message similar to the EXAMPLE MESSAGE below will be
 printed during installation: "Entry #3457 for 97001 REFER/CONS/SCREEN
 [CPT: 97001] (RC001)  ... successfully added. Your site has a local
 procedure 90002 in File #725" which uses "RC001" as its National Number.
 Please inactivate this local procedure."
  
 Please review the installed message.
  
  
     Resolution Detail: 1-4 below:
 (1) The new entries that will be added to the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE
     (#725) file are:

 (3) After the updates to the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file are made,
     the patch performs an inspection of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS
     (#720.3) file. Any active EC EVENT CODE SCREENS (#720.3) file record
     which points to an inactive EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file record
     or to an inactive CPT (#81) file record will be identified.
     The results of the inspection are placed in a MailMan message and
     sent to the user that performed the patch installation.
  
 Example of the MailMan message:
 -------------------------------
     Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or
     Event Capture ADPAC.
  
     A review of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) was done
     after installation of patch EC*2*97 which updated the EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE file (#725).  This message provides the results of that
     review.
  
     The EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) records indicated below
     point to an inactive record in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file
     (#725) or to an inactive record in the CPT file (#81).
     The user should use the Inactivate Event Code Screens [ECNACT]
     option to inactivate the Event Code Screen.  If necessary, a new
     Event Code Screen can be created using a currently active CPT code
     or National Procedure.
