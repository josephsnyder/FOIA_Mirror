     Problem:
     --------
     A request was made to update the VistA Event Capture EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE (#725) file.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The changes were submitted by the Bedford Technical Services
     Office (BTSO) Decision Support Services (DSS) Program Office to be
     implemented upon release of the patch. This patch updates the EC
     NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file by modifying one NAME (description)
     (#.01) field, inactivating one national code, and adding 2 new
     procedure records.
  
 **************************************************************************
 Note: The new EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE Numbers could exist in some site's
 environment. If the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE Numbers exist, then the system
 will add the new numbers and it will keep what the sites have on file. In
 addition, a message similar to the one below will be printed during
 installation: 
  
 "Entry #3457 for 97001 REFER/CONS/SCREEN [CPT: 97001] (RC001)  ...
 successfully added. Your site has a local procedure 90002 in
 File #725" which uses "RC001" as its National Number. Please inactivate
 this local procedure."
  
 Please review the installed message.
 **************************************************************************
  
 Resolution Detail: 1-4 below:
 (1) The new entries that will be added to the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE
     (#725) file are:
      Natl #      Description                           CPT Code
      ------      -----------                           --------
      NU185      HBPC INPT 1ST 10M                     99499
      NU186      HBPC INPT EA ADDL 10M  
  
  
 (2) The following description names updates will be made in NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE (#725) file:
  
      Natl #  Old Description                            New Description
      Code
      ------  ---------------                            ----------------

 (3) The entries that will be inactivated in the NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725)
     file are:
  
     Natl #   Description                                    Inactive Date

     NU183    99090/MNTR-ELEC DATA                           4/1/2009
  
 (4) After the updates to the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file are made,
     the patch performs an inspection of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS
     (#720.3) file. Any active EC EVENT CODE SCREENS (#720.3) file record
     which points to an inactive EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file record
     or to an inactive CPT (#81) file record will be identified.
     The results of the inspection are placed in a MailMan message and
     sent to the user that performed the patch installation.
  
 Example of the MailMan message:
 -------------------------------
     Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or
     Event Capture ADPAC.
  
     A review of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) was done
     after installation of patch EC*2*102 which updated the EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE file (#725).  This message provides the results of that
     review.
  
     The EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) records indicated below
     point to an inactive record in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file
     (#725) or to an inactive record in the CPT file (#81).
     The user should use the Inactivate Event Code Screens [ECNACT]
     option to inactivate the Event Code Screen.  If necessary, a new
     Event Code Screen can be created using a currently active CPT code
     or National Procedure.
