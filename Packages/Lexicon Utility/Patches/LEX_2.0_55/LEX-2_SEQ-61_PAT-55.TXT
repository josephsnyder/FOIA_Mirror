  This patch exports the Mammography Assessment Categories from the 
  Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) for the Lexicon 
  Utility in support of the Radiology Outside Reporting project and
  makes minor changes to the Lexicon lookup to access these BI-RADS
  terms.  It also adds BI-RADS and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) 
  codes to the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file #78.3, using internal entry 
  numbers 1100 thru 1106 and 1200 thru 1202, respectively.
  
  
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  ============
  
  
    Lexicon Enhancements
    --------------------
  
      BI-RADS and MQSA terms and codes have been added to the Expression
      file 757.01 and Codes file 757.02.  These terms and codes are 
      taken from the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging
      Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) and the Mammography Quality 
      Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA).

      Two new special lookup variables are implemented with this patch
      (see Lexicon Technical Manual, Special Variables, Variables 
      affecting the Lookup).  Added:
       
          LEXSRC    The documented source of terminology (from the 
                    Lexicon Source file 757.14)
       
          LEXCAT    If a source is divided into categories, this is
                    the category/sub-category within the source 
                    (from the Lexicon Source Category file 757.13)
       
  
    Radiology Enhancements
    ---------------------
  
      BI-RADS and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) codes are added to
      the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file #78.3, using internal entry numbers 
      1100 thru 1106 and 1200 thru 1202, respectively.
  
      It also adds the display of the MQSA coding text next to the 
      BI-RADS code for file look up and all reports and API's that 
      currently display diagnostic codes.  It checks if a BI-RADS 
      diagnostic code is required for an outside report, and if so,
      would display a warning message if the required BI-RADS 
      diagnostic code wasn't entered during the use of the 'Outside 
      Report Entry/Edit' [RA OUTSIDE RPTENTRY] option.
  
      The maintenance portion fixes routine RABWORD1 and two print
      templates so that they use APIs to retrieve CPT modifiers 
      and ICD9 codes, instead of reading directly from old fields
      that are scheduled for deletion.
  
  
  ROUTINE ENHANCEMENTS:
  ====================
  
  
    Lexicon Routine Enhancements
    ----------------------------
  
      LEXA      This routine has been modified by adding two new 
                parameters (Source and Category) to the entry point 
                LOOK^LEXA.  If defined, terms associated with the Source
                and/or Category will be placed on the list of terms found
                in the ^TMP("LEXFND") global array.  The two extrinsic 
                functions $$SRC and $$CAT have been added to resolve the
                two new parameters to files 757.14 and 757.13 
                respectively.
       
      LEXA1     This is the Lexicon Special Lookup routine.  It has been 
                modified to look for the variables LEXSRC and LEXCAT and 
                pass them to LOOK^LEXA.  It has also been modified to 
                look for special characters (control characters and 
                apostrophes, see Remedy Tickets).
       
      LEXAL     This routine builds the list of terms found during the
                lookup.  It has been modified to utilized the Source and 
                Category fields in 757.01 to place source specific
                terminology on the search list in ^TMP("LEXFND").
       
      LEXAR     This routine gets the response from the user and is 
                called by special lookup ^LEXA1.  It has been modified 
                to leave the lookup defaults found in global array
                ^TMP("LEXSCH") for subsequent lookups.  See Remedy
                Tickets below.
  
      LEXAR4    This routine provides information about a term and is 
                called by INFO^LEXA.  It has been modified to allow 
                the source and category of an expression to be saved in
                the LEX("SEL") array.
       
      LEXAR5    This routine provides additional information about a 
                term.  It has been modified to allow the BI-RADS codes
                to be saved in the LEX("SEL") array.
       
      LEXTOLKN  This routine takes a string (term) and parses it into 
                words.  It has been modified to process apostrophe
                "s" as both a word and a plural word to facilitate
                various forms of user input during lookup. It has also
                been modified to remove control characters.
       
                   Term              Cross-Referenced as
                   BIRAD'S                 BIRAD

    Radiology Routine Enhancements
    ------------------------------
  
      RA97PST   This is a new routine used to add BI-RADS and AAA records 
                into the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file (#78.3).  It is also used 
                to add the display of the MQSA coding system's text
                alongside the BI-RADS code during user selection lookup.  
                It resets the record counter for file #78.3 after the patch
                installation.
  
      RA97PST1  This is a new routine used during the patch installation to
                retrieve BI-RADS codes from the Lexicon application's 
                EXPRESSIONS file (#757.01).
  
      RABIRAD   This is a new routine used for the 'Outside Report
                Entry/Edit' [RA OUTSIDE RPTENTRY] option.  It checks if a
                case should require a BI-RADS code.  If the case is missing
                a required BI-RADS code, then a warning message will be
                displayed.  It also displays extra fields after BI-RADS and
                AAA records whenever the user enters a "?" or "??" at the
                DIAGNOSTIC CODES prompt.  The extra field displayed for
                BI-RADS is the MQSA coding system's text from the Lexicon's
                EXPRESSIONS file (#757.01).  The extra field displayed for
                AAA is the DESCRIPTION from the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file
                (#78.3).
  
      RABWORD1  This routine has been modified to convert a direct read of 
                the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) to a supported code set 
                versioning API:  $$ICDDX^ICDCODE( ).
  
      RADLQ1    This routine has been modified to display the correct report
                status for an electronically filed report in the 'Delinquent
                Status Report' [RA DELINQUENT] option.  It is also modified 
                to add a screen pause at the end of the last screen so the 
                display won't scroll off the screen.
  
      RAEDCN    This routine has been modified to disallow the use of the
                'Diagnostic Code and Interpreter Edit by Case No.' [RA
                DIAGCN] option for a case that doesn't have a report yet or
                has a stub report or an electronically filed report.
  
      RAO7PC2   This routine has been modified to output the MQSA coding 
                system's text next to the BI-RADS diagnostic code.  This is
                a routine that is used by other applications to display a
                Radiology report.
  
      RAPRINT   These routines have been modified for the 'Abnormal Exam
      RAPRINT1  Report' [RA ABNORMAL] option to allow the user to select
                data by VA radiologist only, Electronically Filed only, or
                both.  RAPRINT1 was also modified to display the MQSA
                coding system's text beneath the BI-RADS code and correct a
                bug found during development testing.  The bug occurred
                when a case had two abnormal diagnostic codes, and the case
                # displayed under the first abnormal diagnostic code but
                not under the second abnormal diagnostic code. This was due
                to the case being the last case with the first abnormal
                diagnostic code and the first case with the second abnormal
                diagnostic code.
  
      RART      This routine has been modified for the 'Display a Rad/Nuc 
                Med Report' [RA RPTDISP] option to display the MQSA coding
                system's text next to the BI-RADS diagnostic code.
  
      RARTE5    This routine has been modified for the 'Outside Report 
                Entry/Edit' [RA OUTSIDE RPTENTRY] option to use routine
                RABIRAD to check for a required BI-RADS code.
  
      RARTE7    This routine has been modified for the 'Outside Report
                Entry/Edit' [RA OUTSIDE RPTENTRY] option to generate an
                "Imaging Results" alert when an outside report has been
                entered the first time and it doesn't have an abnormal
                diagnostic code.  (The wording of this alert is changed 
                to "Imaging Results,Non Critical" by the released patch
                RA*5*93.)  Previously, only abnormal diagnostic codes would
                cause an alert to be generated from this option.
  
      RARTR1    This routine has been modified for options: 'Draft Report 
                (Reprint)' [RA REPRINT], 'Select Report to Print by 
                Patient' [RA RPTPAT] and the background processing that
                sends a verified report to the requesting physician.  This 
                modification adds the display of the MQSA coding system's
                text alongside the BI-RADS code in the output.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  =========================
       
    1)  Radiology users should be off the system during the installation
        of this host file but other users may be on the system. It is
        recommended that this host file be installed during non-peak hours.
        The global backup (step 2) may take up to 30 minutes.  The KIDS
        installation should take less than 5 minutes.
  
    2)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
   
            Lexical Files                #757-757.41    ^LEX
            Sub-Set Definition             #757.2       ^LEXT
   
        These backup files may get as large as 1.17 gigabytes.  Make sure
        space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 15 to
        40 minutes to create the backup files.
  
        When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
        saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
        non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
        the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
        number and no commas, as shown below).  Example:
   
            Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
            ------           --------------------------

    3)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
       
    4)  Distribution Load:
       
        Load the KIDS Distribution from the host file LEX_RA_BIRADS_97.KID
        which you obtained via FTP.
  
    5)  KIDS Installation:
              
        Use the KIDS Installation Menu.
                 
        a)  Pre-Install Options:
  
            From the KIDS Installation Menu, you may choose the following 
            options prior to installing this patch:
                 
                 2    Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 3    Print Transport Global
                 4    Compare Transport Global to Current System
                 5    Backup a Transport Global
                 
              For each of the above options, respond "LEX*2.0*55" only 
              at the "Select INSTALL NAME:" prompt.
                 
              Do *NOT*  enter the Radiology patch name.  These options 
              will automatically bring in the Radiology patch for you.
                 
        b)  Install Option:
  
            From the KIDS Installation Menu, use the following option to
            install the contents of the host file:
                 
                6   Install Package(s)
                 
              Respond "LEX*2.0*55"  only at the "Select INSTALL NAME:"
              prompt.
                  
                Do *NOT* enter the Radiology patch name.
                Do *NOT* reload the host file to install the Radiology patch.
                  
                The Install file LEX*2.0*55 will automatically install both 
                LEX*2.0*55 and RA*5.0*97, creating individual entries in
                both the BUILD and INSTALL files for both the Lexicon and
                Radiology patches.
                  
              Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
              the install?" prompt.
                  
              Respond "YES" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options,
              Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
                  
              Respond "RA*" at the "Enter options you wish to mark as
              'Out Of Order'" prompt to disable RA namespaced options.
                  
              Respond "RA*" at the "Enter protocols you wish to mark 
              as 'Out Of Order'" prompt to disable RA namespaced 
              protocols.
                  
              Respond "0" at the "Delay Install (Minutes)" prompt proceed
              with the install immediately after the options and protocols
              have been disabled.
           
    6)  Cleanup
       
        The Post-Install routine LEX2055P should be deleted using 
        the KERNEL option 'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion
        of the installation.
       
        Routines LEX2055A, LEX2055B, LEX2055C, LEX2055D, LEX2055E,
        LEX2055F, LEX2055G, LEX2055H and LEX2055I will be deleted by
        the post-install routine LEX2055P.
  
        The Post-Install routines RA97PST and RA97PST1 may be deleted
        if the patch processing displayed :
  
        *** 10 of 10 BI-RADS and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm codes have been
        successfully added to the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file #78.3. ***
  
    7)  Post Installation Overview
  
  
        Post LEX*2.0*55
  
          The post installation routine LEX2055P will generate an install
          message and send it to G.LEXINS@FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV and a copy to
          the installer.  If an error is encountered in the install of the
          Lexicon patch it will be reflected in this message, else it will
          simply list the install times of the components.
  
  
        Post RA*5.0*97
  
          1. For sites that will use the exported BI-RADS and AAA codes
             from Voice Recognition (VR) systems, such as PowerScribe or
             TalkStation, the VR systems manager must add the BI-RADS and
             AAA codes exported from Patch RA*5*97 into the diagnostic file
             of the VR system. The exported BI-RADS and AAA field values
             are described in item 2.
  
             It is known that PowerScribe has an inactivation feature and
             TalkStation does not. For sites that will not use the exported
             BI-RADS and AAA codes from VR systems with the inactivation
             feature, the VR systems manager can add the exported codes
             into the diagnostic file of the VR system and inactivate the
             codes. This keeps the diagnostic codes in VistA in sync with
             the diagnostic codes on the VR system.
  
          2. The post installation routines RA97PST and RA97PST1 will add
             the following records to the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file (#78.3):
    
            [Field Number] : Stored value  -> Displayed value

            [6]   : 88 -> Suspicious
           
            [.001]: 1105

            [4]   : y -> YES
            [6]   : 90 -> Highly Suggestive of Malignancy
           
            [.001]: 1106                            
            [.01] : BI-RADS CATEGORY 6
            [2]   : Known Biopsy Proven Malignancy
            [3]   : Y -> YES         
            [4]   : y -> YES
            [6]   : 92 -> Known Biopsy Proven Malignancy
           
            [.001]: 1200
            [.01] : ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM NOT PRESENT
            [2]   : The maximum width of the infrarenal aorta is less than
                    three centimeters.                                
            [3]   : N -> NO
            [4]   : n -> NO
           
            [.001]: 1201
            [.01] : ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM PRESENT
            [2]   : The maximum width of the infrarenal aorta is greater 
                    than three centimeters.                             
            [3]   : Y -> YES
            [4]   : y -> YES
  
            [.001]: 1202
            [.01] : DOES NOT SATISFY SCREEN FOR AAA
            [2]   : Exam is not technically adequate for AAA screening.
            [3]   : N -> NO          
            [4]   : n -> NO
  
  
             If your site already has data in the range 1100-1106 and/or 
             1200-1202, then the post installation will  not  add any of
             the ten records to the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file #78.3.  Instead,
             it will send a mail message to the patch installer and an
             Outlook message to the "VA OIT VHIT Radiology Facility Level
             Application Issues" mail group to notify them that your
             facility has a conflict with one or more internal entry
             numbers (IENS) in file #78.3.
  
             If there is no conflict with the IENs, then the post
             installation will reset the third piece of ^RA(78.3,0) to the
             highest IEN under 999 and also display the following message: 
  
         *** 10 of 10 BI-RADS and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm codes have 
         been successfully added to the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file #78.3. ***
  
          3. The description of the diagnostic code from the 'Diagnostic 
             Code List' [RA DIAGP] option is taken from the Description
             field of the DIAGNOSTIC CODES file (#78.3).  But the MQSA
             coding system's text of BI-RADS from the following options and
             features is taken from the EXPRESSIONS file (#757.01) of the
             Lexicon application:
  
                Display a Rad/Nuc Med Report  [RA RPTDISP]
                Draft Report (Reprint)  [RA REPRINT]
                Select Report to Print by Patient  [RA RPTPAT]
                CPRS Report tab
                Email message of a verified report sent to the requester
  
             The description and the MQSA coding system's text from the
             options will remain identical as long as there are no local
             changes made to the Description field in the DIAGNOSTIC CODES
             file (#78.3) or national changes made to the Displayable Text
             field in the EXPRESSIONS file (#757.01).
