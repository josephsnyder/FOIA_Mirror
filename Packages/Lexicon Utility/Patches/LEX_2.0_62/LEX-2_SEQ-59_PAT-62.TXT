Description:
============

  This patch contains options and routines to facilitate the testing of 
  Lexicon patches, the display of versioned ICD/CPT records, and the listing
  of Code Set changes. 
 
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  ============
 
    This patch adds one Lexicon menu and six menu items to the Option file.  
    Four of the menu items are queries of the ICD and CPT code sets capable
    of displaying a versioned record for a date provided by the user 
    (including future dates).  These four options will eliminate the need
    of Lexicon test sites testing future dates from the programmer prompt.
    The one menu item will list changes that have occurred in both the ICD
    and CPT codes sets on a date provided by a user.  And the last menu item
    will provide a historical display of the versioned data for a selected
    code. All individuals that test Lexicon patches should be given this
    menu with all of its menu items.  Additionally, individuals who 
    routinely work with the CPT or ICD coding systems should also have 
    access to this menu.
