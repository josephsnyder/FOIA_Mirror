Subject: Updated Install Instructions for LEX*2.0*41

Category: 
  - Informational
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 There is a problem in the installation instructions for patch LEX*2.0*41.
 In paragraph 8a, it asks the installer to kill the ^LEXM global.  This
 is a problem since the installation that needs this global is running
 as part of a background process using TaskMan.  If the ^LEXM global is
 killed before the background process is complete, the task will end
 without errors and the install of the data will be incomplete.
 
     For sites that have already installed LEX*2.0*41
     ------------------------------------------------
 
         Here is a simple test to see if your site is affected.  At the
         programmer prompt, perform the following two WRITE statements:
 
           >W $D(^LEX(757.21,"C","[X]ZYGOMYCOSIS, UNSPECIFIED",7444769))
           1
           >W $D(^LEX(757.21,"C","POSTOPERATIVE SHOCK",3567))
           0
 
         If you have LEX*2.0*41 installed and the above two WRITE statements
         do not result in a 1 and 0 respectively, then you need to re-install
         patch LEX*2.0*41 and ignore the instruction in paragraph 8a of 
         LEX*2.0*41 to KILL ^LEXM.
 
     For sites that have NOT installed LEX*2.0*41
     --------------------------------------------
 
         Proceed with the install instructions ignoring the instruction in 
         paragraph 8a to KILL ^LEXM

   FTP Software Retrieval:
   ---------------------- 
 
     LEX*2.0*41 KIDs builds was distributed in a Packman Message from the
     National Patch Module (NPM).  If you do not have a copy, go to 
     FORUM and forward a copy of patch LEX*2.0*41 to yourself at your
     site.
    
     LEX*2.0*41 Data for this patch is being distributed in a global host
     file:
  
         Filename         FTP Protocol
         ------------     ------------
         LEX_2_41.GBL     ASCII

   Installation Instructions:
   -------------------------
  
                          W - A - R - N - I - N - G                   
                                                      
     This is a very large patch; it increases the size of the Lexicon
     seven-fold and the export file is 1.4GB (Gigabytes).  Installation
     of this patch may result in excessive journaling.  Sites should 
     monitor the journaling but never turn it off.
 
     Please ensure that you have enough temporary space to accommodate the
     export file and have sufficient space for the increased Lexicon        
     size.
                                             
     The install process spawns a background process that may take several 
     hours to complete. Once this process has completed it will send you a
     MailMan message to the account where you installed the patch. 
     Information about the file sizes is documented in the Disc Capacity
     Requirements document that is included with other Documentation above.
 
     Because the install is running in a background process, DO NOT kill
     the import global ^LEXM.  Let the background process deleted it.
 
                          W - A - R - N - I - N - G                   
                                                      
  
       1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*41.
           It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
           hours.  This patch should take between 1 and 4 hours to
           install.
  
       2)  Create a backup of the following globals files before continuing:
  
                 Lexicon Files                 #757-757.41    ^LEX(
                 Subset Definitions file       #757.2         ^LEXT(
  
       3)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global do
           not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM does exist, you
           will need to kill this global before proceeding.
  
           On a Cache system, the prevention of unsubscripted global kills
           is a system wide setting, but can be allowed for a particular
           process using the $ZU command.  The command for enabling
           unsubscripted global kills is:
  
                   VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
                   VAH>K ^LEXM
  
           The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process
           is S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process and
           creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
  
       4)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_41.GBL.  This
           file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
 
              Thin Client Global Restore
 
                   Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache
                   cube, then select "Explorer."  Open the "Namespaces"
                   folder, then open the "VAH" folder, and right click on
                   the "Globals" folder. Select the "Import from disk"
                   option. Click on the "Options..." button.  Select the
                   "Globals" tab, make sure the format is VAX DSM, then
                   click "OK." Find the file in the directory, double click
                   on LEX_2_41.GBL.  Next, select "Import All"  At the prompt
                   "Do you wish to restore '^LEXM'," select "Yes."
 
              Programmer Mode Global Restore
 
                   From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
 
                     >D ^%GI
 
                      Global input
 
                      Device: DEVICE:[PATH]LEX_2_41.GBL   Parameters: "RS"=>
                      Globals were saved on DD Mmm YYYY HH:MM:SS PA Cache
                      with description:  'LEX*2*41 DATA'
 
                      Input option: A
                      ^LEXM
 
           The loading of the global should take from 20 minutes to 2 hours.
 
       5)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
 
       6)  Distribution Load:
  
           Using the Packman message with the subject "Released LEX*2*41 
           SEQ #53," load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message
           using the Packman function "Install/Check Message."
 
       7)  KIDS Installation:
 
           Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
           "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*41.  The KIDS
           installation can take more than an hour depending on the number
           of users/jobs on the system.
 
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
           install?" prompt.
 
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options, Menu
           Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
 
           The loading of the data from the export file into the Lexicon
           globals is quite a lengthy process; therefore it runs as a
           background task. The final act of the background task will be
           to send you a MailMan message informing you that the install
           has completed.
 
       8)  Cleanup
 
           The Environment Check routine LEX2041 and the Post-Install 
           routine LEX2041P should be deleted using the KERNEL option 
           'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the installation.
