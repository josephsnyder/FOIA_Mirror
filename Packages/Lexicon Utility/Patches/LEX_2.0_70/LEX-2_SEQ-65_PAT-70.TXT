  REMEDY TICKETS:

    * 392910  CPT       Modifier RT for CPT 63042
 
 
    * It was discovered that the CPT ranges for Modifiers LT (left) 
      and RT (Right) did not match.  This patch will rebuild the range
      multiple so every CPT/HCPCS Code that has a Left (LT) also has a
      Right (RT).
 
 
  OTHER
  =====
 
      The GX modifier was released in patch LEX*2.0*69 incorrectly 
      designated as a CPT modifier.  This patch re-designated the 
      modifier as HCPCS Modifier GX.
 
 
  FTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
  =======================
 
    Global Host File:                  LEX_2_70.GBL  (ASCII)
 
    The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov,
    which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
 
    The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
    location at the following locations.
 
         Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
         Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
         Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
 
         Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
 
 
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
 
     1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*70.
         It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
         hours.  This patch should take from 37 to 78 minutes to install
         depending on the system.
 
             Create a backup    35-75 minutes
             Load the Global    less that 1 minute
             Kids Install       1-2 minutes
 
     2)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
 
             CPT/HCPCS Procedure         #81         ^ICPT(
             CPT Modifier                #81.3       ^DIC(81.3,
             Lexicon Files            #757-757.41    ^LEX(
 
         These backup files may get as large as 1.1 gigabytes.  Make sure
         space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 35 to
         75 minutes to create the backup files.
 
         When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
         saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
         non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
         the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
         number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
 
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^ICPT            CPT/HCPCS Procedure
             ^LEX             Lexicon Files
 
         When you are creating a backup of a subscripted global, you are
         saving a partial global (a file within a global).  You should use
         the utility ^%GOGEN, and when prompted for a global, enter the open
         global reference (as shown below).  Examples:
 
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^DIC(81.3,       CPT Modifier
 
     3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_70.GBL.  This
         file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
 
         This global is approximately 135 kilobytes in size.  Make sure
         there is sufficient space available to load this global with
         journaling on.  The loading of the global should take less than
         1 minute.
 
         Thin Client Global Restore
 
           Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache 
           cube, then select "Explorer."  Open the "Namespaces"
           folder, then open the "VAH" folder, and right click on
           the "Globals" folder. Select the "Import from disk" 
           option. Click on the "Options..." button.  Select the 
           "Globals" tab, make sure the format is VAX DSM, then 
           click "OK." Find the file in the directory, double click
           on LEX_2_70.GBL.  Next, select "Import All."  At the 
           prompt "Do you wish to restore '^LEXM'," select "Yes."
 
         Programmer Mode
 
           From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
 
             >D ^%GI
 
             Global input
 
             Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_70.GBL
             Parameters? "RS" =>
             Globals were saved on 10 Jun 2010   9:17 AM   Cache
             with description: LEX*2.0*70/ICPT*6.0*52 Data
             
             Input option: A
             ^LEXM
 
 
     4)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
 
     5)  Distribution Load:
 
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
 
     6)  KIDS Installation:
 
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*70.
 
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
           the install?" prompt.
 
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
           Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
 
         The KIDs install should take from 1-2 minutes
 
     7)  Cleanup
 
         a)  The Environment Check routine LEX2070 and the Post-Install 
             routines LEX2070A, LEX2070B, LEX2070C, LEX2070D and LEX2070P
             should be deleted using the KERNEL option 'Delete Routines'
             [XTRDEL] upon completion of the installation.
 
             NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an
                    update protocol and may spawn background tasks for 
                    the Clinical Reminders or Consult packages.  You 
                    do not need to wait for these background jobs to 
                    complete to delete the Environment Check and 
                    Post-Install routines.
