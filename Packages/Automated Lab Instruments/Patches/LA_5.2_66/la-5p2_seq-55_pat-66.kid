 This patch upgrades the Lab Universal Interface (UI) from VistA's Health Level
"BLD",7429,1,20,0)
 Seven (HL) v1.5 to HL v1.6 including the use of v1.6 TCP/IP functionality.  It
"BLD",7429,1,21,0)
 supports the current Lab UI HL7 Interface Specifications based on the HL7
"BLD",7429,1,22,0)
 Standard V2.2.
"BLD",7429,1,23,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,24,0)
 The current UI interface using the HL v1.5 interface will continue to function
"BLD",7429,1,25,0)
 after patch installation.  The transition to the HL V1.6 interface can be
"BLD",7429,1,26,0)
 accomplished after patch installation on a connection by connection basis.
"BLD",7429,1,27,0)
 When possible, switching from the old interface to the new interface should be
"BLD",7429,1,28,0)
 done on a per instrument basis instead of all instruments at once.  Follow the
"BLD",7429,1,29,0)
 post installation instructions to convert an interface to the HL V1.6
"BLD",7429,1,30,0)
 interface.
"BLD",7429,1,31,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,32,0)
    Note: New Generic Instrument Manager (GIM) software must be obtained
"BLD",7429,1,33,0)
          from the vendor in order for this new interface to work.
"BLD",7429,1,34,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,35,0)
 Before the release of this patch lab instruments interfaced through TCP/IP were
"BLD",7429,1,36,0)
 using a non-supported modification of an HL7 routine.  This patch will allow
"BLD",7429,1,37,0)
 sites to interface their automated testing devices via supported TCP/IP
"BLD",7429,1,38,0)
 functionality and will allow the sites to manage these interfaces using the HL7
"BLD",7429,1,39,0)
 v1.6 package's tools.
"BLD",7429,1,40,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,41,0)
 HL7 messages are HL7 version 2.2 and the messaging is composed of ORM~O01 and
"BLD",7429,1,42,0)
 ORU~R01 messages.  Messaging uses original acknowledgement mode.  ORM messages
"BLD",7429,1,43,0)
 use "LA7LAB" as the Sending Application and "LA7UIx" as the Receiving
"BLD",7429,1,44,0)
 Application.  ORU messages use "LA7UIx" as the Sending Application and "LA7LAB"
"BLD",7429,1,45,0)
 as the Receiving Application.
"BLD",7429,1,46,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,47,0)
 The PROTOCOL (#101), HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER (#771), HL LOGICAL LINK (#870)
"BLD",7429,1,48,0)
 and LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER (#62.48) files each have ten entries using a naming
"BLD",7429,1,49,0)
 convention that contains "LA7UIx" (where "x" is an integer) such as "LA7UI1
"BLD",7429,1,50,0)
 ORU-R01 EVENT 2.2" and "LA7UI1."  This convention allows the site to interface
"BLD",7429,1,51,0)
 with multiple generic instrument managers.
"BLD",7429,1,52,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,53,0)
 To setup an auto-instrument, the MESSAGE CONFIGURATION field (#8) of the AUTO
"BLD",7429,1,54,0)
 INSTRUMENT file (#62.4) must be set to the appropriate LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER
"BLD",7429,1,55,0)
 file (#62.48) entry (ie LA7UI1).  Also, the FILE BUILD ENTRY field (#93) should
"BLD",7429,1,56,0)
 equal "EN" and the FILE BUILD ROUTINE field (#94) should equal "LA7UID".
"BLD",7429,1,57,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,58,0)
 In order to send/receive messages the configuration needs to be set ACTIVE via
"BLD",7429,1,59,0)
 its STATUS field (#2) of LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER file (#62.48).  The
"BLD",7429,1,60,0)
 configuration must also specify which routine is used to process messages in
"BLD",7429,1,61,0)
 LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER file (#62.48) PROCESS DOWNLOAD field (#6) which should be
"BLD",7429,1,62,0)
 set to "D EN^LA7UIO" for Lab Universal Interfaces.

 1)  The v1.5 interface constructed ORM message segments that were not in
"BLD",7429,1,76,0)
 compliance with the HL7 standard.  Previously an ORC segment was followed by
"BLD",7429,1,77,0)
 one or more OBR segments.  The HL7 standard specifies that ORC/OBR segments
"BLD",7429,1,78,0)
 should exist as a pair so in this interface each ordered test will be sent in
"BLD",7429,1,79,0)
 the ORM message as an ORC/OBR segment pair.  Example:
"BLD",7429,1,80,0)
   PID...
"BLD",7429,1,81,0)
   PV1...
"BLD",7429,1,82,0)
   ORC...
"BLD",7429,1,83,0)
   OBR...
"BLD",7429,1,84,0)
   ORC...
"BLD",7429,1,85,0)
   OBR...
"BLD",7429,1,86,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,87,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,88,0)
 2)  HL7 message data is now checked for conflicts with HL7 delimiters.  If data
"BLD",7429,1,89,0)
 conflicts with the message's delimiters then the data with be escape encoded
"BLD",7429,1,90,0)
 according to HL7 rules.
"BLD",7429,1,91,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,92,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,93,0)
 3)  In an ORM message, OBR-18 is constructed as an HL7 string data type.  The
"BLD",7429,1,94,0)
 HL7 v1.5 interface constructed it as a coded element (CE) data type.
"BLD",7429,1,95,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,96,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,97,0)
 4)  For Lab UI messages, if the specimen received does not match the HL7 0070
"BLD",7429,1,98,0)
 table, an interface error message will be created unless the specimen is
"BLD",7429,1,99,0)
 related to the LAB CONTROL NAME file (#62.3).
"BLD",7429,1,100,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,101,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,102,0)
 5)  For Lab UI messages, any units/reference ranges received from an instrument
"BLD",7429,1,103,0)
 are discarded as the units/reference ranges from the associated LABORATORY TEST
"BLD",7429,1,104,0)
 file (#60) are used.
"BLD",7429,1,105,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,106,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,107,0)
 6)  For Lab UI messages, abnormal flags received from an instrument are not
"BLD",7429,1,108,0)
 stored.
"BLD",7429,1,109,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,110,0)
 7)  The Lab UI Auto Download process (routine LA7ADL) is changed to support the
"BLD",7429,1,111,0)
 FileMan system wide lock timeout via supported API LOCK^DILF.
"BLD",7429,1,112,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,113,0)
 8. To provide for data entry consistency, results received via this
"BLD",7429,1,114,0)
 interface are validated against the input transform for the data field
"BLD",7429,1,115,0)
 used to store the test results. Test results received from an instrument
"BLD",7429,1,116,0)
 that do not conform to the input transform for the related Lab Data Name
"BLD",7429,1,117,0)
 will be rejected.
"BLD",7429,1,118,0)
 
"BLD",7429,1,119,0)
 If SET OF CODES is utilized as the data type for a particular interfaced
"BLD",7429,1,120,0)
 test, the internally stored code needs to be brought into alignment with
"BLD",7429,1,121,0)
 what the instrument is reporting. If the instrument sends a result that
"BLD",7429,1,122,0)
 does not match what is entered in the SET OF CODES that result is
"BLD",7429,1,123,0)
 considered not to be verifiable data.

 This patch upgrades the Lab Universal Interface (UI) from VistA's Health Level
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
 Seven (HL) v1.5 to HL v1.6 including the use of v1.6 TCP/IP functionality.  It
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
 supports the current Lab UI HL7 Interface Specifications based on the HL7
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
 Standard V2.2.
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
 
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
 The current UI interface using the HL v1.5 interface will continue to function
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
 after patch installation.  The transition to the HL V1.6 interface can be
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
 accomplished after patch installation on a connection by connection basis.
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
 When possible, switching from the old interface to the new interface should be
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
 done on a per instrument basis instead of all instruments at once.  Follow the
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
 post installation instructions to convert an interface to the HL V1.6
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
 interface.
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
 
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
    Note: New Generic Instrument Manager (GIM) software must be obtained
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
          from the vendor in order for this new interface to work.

 Before the release of this patch lab instruments interfaced through TCP/IP were
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
 using a non-supported modification of an HL7 routine.  This patch will allow
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
 sites to interface their automated testing devices via supported TCP/IP
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
 functionality and will allow the sites to manage these interfaces using the HL7
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
 v1.6 package's tools.

 HL7 messages are HL7 version 2.2 and the messaging is composed of ORM~O01 and
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
 ORU~R01 messages.  Messaging uses original acknowledgement mode.  ORM messages
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
 use "LA7LAB" as the Sending Application and "LA7UIx" as the Receiving
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
 Application.  ORU messages use "LA7UIx" as the Sending Application and "LA7LAB"
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
 as the Receiving Application.

"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)
 ORU-R01 EVENT 2.2" and "LA7UI1."  This convention allows the site to interface
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,51,0)
 with multiple generic instrument managers.

 To setup an auto-instrument, the MESSAGE CONFIGURATION field (#8) of the AUTO
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,54,0)
 INSTRUMENT file (#62.4) must be set to the appropriate LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,55,0)
 file (#62.48) entry (ie LA7UI1).  Also, the FILE BUILD ENTRY field (#93) should
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,56,0)
 equal "EN" and the FILE BUILD ROUTINE field (#94) should equal "LA7UID".
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,57,0)
 
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,58,0)
 In order to send/receive messages the configuration needs to be set ACTIVE via

 its STATUS field (#2) of LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER file (#62.48).  The
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)

 1)  The v1.5 interface constructed ORM message segments that were not in
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,76,0)
 compliance with the HL7 standard.  Previously an ORC segment was followed by
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,77,0)
 one or more OBR segments.  The HL7 standard specifies that ORC/OBR segments
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,78,0)
 should exist as a pair so in this interface each ordered test will be sent in
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,79,0)
 the ORM message as an ORC/OBR segment pair.  Example:
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,80,0)
   PID...
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,81,0)
   PV1...
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,82,0)
   ORC...
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,83,0)
   OBR...

"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,87,0)
 
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,88,0)
 2)  HL7 message data is now checked for conflicts with HL7 delimiters.  If data
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,89,0)
 conflicts with the message's delimiters then the data with be escape encoded
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,90,0)
 according to HL7 rules.

"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,92,0)
 
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,93,0)
 3)  In an ORM message, OBR-18 is constructed as an HL7 string data type.  The
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,94,0)
 HL7 v1.5 interface constructed it as a coded element (CE) data type.

 4)  For Lab UI messages, if the specimen received does not match the HL7 0070
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,98,0)
 table, an interface error message will be created unless the specimen is
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,99,0)
 related to the LAB CONTROL NAME file (#62.3).

 5)  For Lab UI messages, any units/reference ranges received from an instrument
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,103,0)
 are discarded as the units/reference ranges from the associated LABORATORY TEST
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,104,0)
 file (#60) are used.
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,105,0)
 
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,106,0)
 
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,107,0)
 6)  For Lab UI messages, abnormal flags received from an instrument are not
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,108,0)
 stored.
"PKG",11,22,1,"PAH",1,1,109,0)
