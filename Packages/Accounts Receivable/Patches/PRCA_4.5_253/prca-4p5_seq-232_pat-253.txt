Description:
============

 This patch is being implemented in support of the "Hold Debt to DMC" 
 project. This is being implemented to avoid inappropriate debt referrals 
 to Debt Management Center (DMC) for veterans who are either Service 
 Connected (SC) 50% to 100% or in receipt of a VA pension.
  
 This patch will modify the existing VistA AR application to do the 
 following:
    a.  Enhance the existing VistA software logic to exclude DMC eligible
        debts associated with veterans who are SC 50% to 100% or in receipt
        of VA pension from being referred to the DMC.
    b.  Introduce a new "DMC Debt Valid" field in the Accounts Receivable
        application.
    c.  Create a new report option in AR for Veterans who are SC 50% to
        100% or in receipt of a VA pension.
    d.  Create a new report option in AR to assist the AR Supervisors in
        reviewing the processing of the bills for Veterans who are SC 50%
        to 100% or in receipt of VA pension.
    e.  Create a new report option in AR to assist users in focusing on
        reviewing the legitimacy of bills where the veteran has a Rated 
        Disability change during a given time period and is neither SC 50%
        to 100% nor in receipt of VA Pension.

       Note: When the veteran is not Service Connected 50% to 100% and
       is not Receiving a VA Pension the new software will also include
       the functionality to consider a veteran as Receiving a VA Pension
       if he/she is receiving A&A or Housebound Benefits.
  
    Rated Disability Eligibility Change Report [RCDMCR3 RD ELIG CHANGE 
    REPORT]
       This Accounts Receivable option is to assist users in focusing on
       reviewing the legitimacy of first party bills where the veteran
       is neither SC 50% to 100% nor in receipt of VA Pension benefits
       (Veterans not included on the "DMC Debt Validity Report"). The
       report would contain information on veterans who have bills for
       episodes of care within the previous 365 days (or older selected
       date) and who have a new Rated Disability during a user selected 
       time period. 
  
       Authorized billing staff can run the report to ensure that all bills
       meeting the above criteria are reviewed and if necessary the
       appropriate action is taken as follows:
           Bill is appropriate - There shall be no action taken.
           Bill is inappropriate - AR staff shall cancel the bill using
                                   existing functionality.
           Inappropriate bill sent to DMC - AR staff shall cancel/refund
                                            using existing functionality.
  
       The report allows for the user to select the time period for Rated
       Disabilities, to select the date from which to include bills for 
       episodes of care on the report, and to select if they want the
       report printed in a Detailed Format or in an Excel Delimited Format.
  
       It is recommended that the user queues this report to a device
       that is 132 characters wide.
  
       The report will include the following data elements:

    Rated Disability Elig Change Rpt - Scheduled Task [RCDMCR3 RD ELIG 
    CHANGE TASK]
       This Accounts Receivable option is used to schedule the Rated
       Disability Eligibility Change Report to run on a recurring basis
       without user intervention. It is used to assist users in
       focusing on reviewing the legitimacy of first party bills where
       the veteran is neither SC 50% to 100% nor in receipt of VA
       Pension benefits (Veterans not included on the "DMC Debt Validity
       Report"). The report will contain information on veterans who
       have bills for episodes of care within the previous X1 days and
       who have a new Rated Disability during the last X2 days.
  
       X1 will be the value entered in the "NUMBER OF DAYS FOR DMC REPORTS"
       (#8.02) field of the AR SITE PARAMETER (#342) file. If this value
       isn't entered the report will default to bills from episodes of care
       for the past 365 days. This parameter can be edited using the
       Enter/Edit DMC Report # Days for Episodes of Care [RCDMC EDIT DMC
       REPORT # OF DAY] option.
  
       X2 will be the value entered in the "# OF DAYS FOR RD ELIG CHG RPT" 
       (#8.01) field of the AR SITE PARAMETER (#342) file. If this value
       isn't entered or is zero, the report will default to RD data for the
       last 31 days. This parameter can be edited using the Enter/Edit RD
       Number of Days Report Parameter [RCDMC EDIT RD # OF DAYS PARAME]
       option.
  
       Authorized billing staff can use the report to ensure that all
       bills meeting the above criteria are reviewed and if necessary
       the appropriate action is taken as follows:
           Bill is appropriate - There shall be no action taken.
           Bill is inappropriate - AR staff shall cancel the bill using
                                   existing functionality.
           Inappropriate bill sent to DMC - AR staff shall cancel/refund
                                            using existing functionality.
  
       The scheduled report can only be printed in the detailed format
       and it should be sent to a device that is 132 characters wide.
  
       The report will include the following data elements:

 ************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
  
 If the Accounts Receivable Nightly Process Background Job [PRCA NIGHTLY
 PROCESS] Option was unscheduled, please re-scheduled this option.
  
 Determine if the follows options are required to be scheduled by your 
 Account Receivable Staff:
  
    DMC Debt Validity Report - Scheduled Task [RCDMCR1 DEBT VALIDITY TASK 
       RPT]
    DMC Debt Validity Management Rpt - Scheduled Task [RCDMCR2 DEBT VALID 
       MGMT TASK]
    Rated Disability Elig Change Rpt - Scheduled Task [RCDMCR3 RD ELIG 
       CHANGE TASK]
  
 If options are to be scheduled you will need to determine the frequency 
 for which to schedule these reports to be run. The jobs should not be 
 scheduled more frequently than once per day. These options generate 
 reports that are 132 characters wide. You will need to determine the 
 output device (printer) where they will be sent to print.
  
 All three tasked report options allows for the site to determine how many
 days in the past bills for episodes of care will be included on the 
 reports. The default value is 365 day. If the Account Receivable staff 
 would like to allow data further in the past use the Enter/Edit
 DMC Report # Days for Episodes of Care [RCDMC EDIT DMC REPORT # OF DAY] 
 Option which will allow the site to specify a time frame greater than 365 
 day up to 3650 days (10 years).
  
 The Rated Disability Elig Change Rpt - Scheduled Task [RCDMCR3 RD ELIG 
 CHANGE TASK] option allows for the site to determine the number of days 
 in the past for which to get Rated Disability Eligibility changes. The 
 Account Receivable staff will need to determine the date period to be 
 used at the site. The default period will be for the last 31 days if the 
 site hasn't entered a value in the "# OF DAYS FOR RD ELIG CHG RPT" site 
 parameter in the AR Site Parameter (#342) file using the Enter/Edit RD 
 Number of Days Report Parameter [RCDMC EDIT RD # OF DAYS PARAME] option.
  
 The DMC Referral Menu [PRCA RCDMC REFERRAL MENU] menu option was updated
 to include the following new options:
    DMC Debt Validity Report [RCDMCR1 DEBT VALIDITY REPORT]
    DMC Debt Validity Management Report [RCDMCR2 DEBT VALIDITY MGMT RPT]
    Rated Disability Eligibility Change Report [RCDMCR3 RD ELIG CHANGE 
       REPORT]
    Enter/Edit DMC Debt Validation [RCDMCEDT ENTER/EDIT DMC DEBT]
    Enter/Edit RD Number of Days Report Parameter [RCDMC EDIT RD # OF DAYS 
       PARAME]
    Enter/Edit DMC Report # Days for Episodes of Care [RCDMC EDIT DMC 
       REPORT # OF DAY]
  
 These new options can be added to site developed menu options or as 
 secondary options for specific users as necessitated by the facility. 
 These new options do not require any security keys and use of them is 
 dependent on a user's menu/option assignment/access.
  
 Please re-add any locally added menu item(s) which were removed by this
 patch back to the DMC Referral Menu [PRCA RCDMC REFERRAL MENU] menu
 option.
