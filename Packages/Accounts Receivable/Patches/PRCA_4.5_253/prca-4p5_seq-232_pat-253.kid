This build is for the PRCA*4.5*253 patch which is for the "Hold Debt to
"BLD",7478,1,2,0)
DMC" project. This will provide an enhancement to help avoid inappropriate
"BLD",7478,1,3,0)
debt referrals to Debt Management Center (DMC) for veterans who are either
"BLD",7478,1,4,0)
Service Connection (SC) 50% to 100% or in receipt of a VA pension.
"BLD",7478,1,5,0)
 
"BLD",7478,1,6,0)
This patch will modify the existing VistA AR application to:
"BLD",7478,1,7,0)
    a.  Enhance the existing VistA software DMC logic to exclude DMC
"BLD",7478,1,8,0)
        eligible debts associated with veterans who are SC 50% to 100% or
"BLD",7478,1,9,0)
        in receipt of VA pension from being referred to the DMC.
"BLD",7478,1,10,0)
    b.  Introduce a new "DMC Debt Valid" field in the Accounts Receivable
"BLD",7478,1,11,0)
        application.
"BLD",7478,1,12,0)
    c.  Create a new report option in AR for Veterans who are SC 50% to
"BLD",7478,1,13,0)
        100% or in receipt of a VA pension.
"BLD",7478,1,14,0)
    d.  Create a new report option in AR to assist the AR Supervisors in
"BLD",7478,1,15,0)
        reviewing the processing of the bills for Veterans who are SC 50%
"BLD",7478,1,16,0)
        to 100% or in receipt of VA pension.
"BLD",7478,1,17,0)
    e.  Create a new report option in AR to assist users in focusing on
"BLD",7478,1,18,0)
        reviewing the legitimacy of bills where the veteran has a Rated
"BLD",7478,1,19,0)
        Disability change during a given time period and is neither SC 50%
"BLD",7478,1,20,0)
        to 100% nor in receipt of VA Pension.

        100% or in receipt of a VA pension.
