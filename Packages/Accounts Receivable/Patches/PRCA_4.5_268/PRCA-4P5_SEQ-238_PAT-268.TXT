  *******************************************************************
  
 This patch is to resolve a long standing problem with an estimated amount 
 due display in the Receipt Processing [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING] menu 
 option.  Within this menu option while an Agent Cashier is posting a 
 payment to a Veteran's account there is an attempt to display a potential 
 amount due for Outpatient Medication Copayments that have not been 
 released within the Pharmacy package on the current date.  When the 
 display was added to the Accounts Receivable package a flat rate of $7.00 
 was hard set within the software.  Subsequently Remedy ticket #126573 was 
 logged and referred for resolution since the Outpatient Medication 
 Copayment rate changed 1/1/2006 to $8.00 per 30 days supply.  When patch 
 PRCA*4.5*244 was nationally released the updated hard set amount was 
 changed from $7.00 to $8.00.
  
 With the upcoming rate change for specific patient priority groups 
 (IB*2*429) the hard coding within the AR package will no longer function 
 correctly.  This patch will change the way the 30 days supply rate is 
 determined by utilizing an Integrated Billing API.  Upon install users 
 should expect to see no difference but when Outpatient Medication 
 Copayment rates change, the AR package will no longer need updates since 
 the rate determination is being moved to the Integrated Billing package.
