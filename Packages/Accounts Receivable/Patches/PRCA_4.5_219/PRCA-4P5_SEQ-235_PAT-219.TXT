Subject: 3RD LETTERS PRINT REGARDLESS OF ACTIVITY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two related issues that involve the patient statement
 print functionality. First, the third statement is now printed when
 necessary even if there has been no activity except interest/admin
 charges. Second, the messages from the Check Patient Account Balance [PRCA
 ACCOUNT CHECK] option have been adjusted to be consistent with the above.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.    HD0000000063764  MAR-0204-21303   No 3rd Letter
  
       Problem
       -------
       TOP functionality dictates that the account will not be sent
       to TOP until all three patient letters have been sent.
       However, the code has a check that prohibits the bill from
       printing a third letter if there was not any activity
       except interest and admin charges.
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       Changed the code in PRCA Account Check, CCPC file build and
       CCPC Patient Statement that checks for activity before
       printing third letter. The code will now check to make sure
       a third letter has been printed.  As a result of this change, the
       message 'This patient's statement will not print because it has
       no new activity for the past three statement dates other than
       int/admin charges.' will no longer appear while using the
       Check Patient Account Balance [PRCA ACCOUNT CHECK] option. If the
       third letter has been printed, a new message will be 
       generated - 'This patient's statement will not print because the
       third letter has already printed'.

 POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 Run REPORT^PRCA219P. This report could take a long time so it would
 be advantageous to run it during non-peak hours. You will be prompted for
 the print device for the report.
  
 This report should be passed to the AR Supervisor along with a copy of
 this patch description. The contents should be reviewed by the AR
 department prior to the running of the next Monthly Run of the AR 
 Nightly job that prints patient bills.
  
 The report is a list of AR patient bills that have a second but not
 a third letter printed, where the time since the second letter printing
 is greater than 30 days and the current balance is greater than zero.
 The AR department should review this report and determine if any billing
 adjustments need to be made before the third letters get printed.
  
 Note: Some of these bills printed could be quite old.
  
 The report may be run as many times as needed.
