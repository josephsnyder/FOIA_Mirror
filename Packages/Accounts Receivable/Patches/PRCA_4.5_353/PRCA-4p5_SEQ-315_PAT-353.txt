Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Accounts Receivable patch, PRCA*4.5*353, addresses the following issues 
 on one ticket:
  
 When a bill's Principal Balance is auto-decreased to zero, any 
 remaining Interest Balance, Administrative Cost Balance, Court Costs 
 and Marshall Fees should be adjusted to zero.
  
 When a cancelled charge from Integrated Billing updates an Accounts 
 Receivable bill that has a 'SUSPENDED' status, the decrease should be 
 posted to the bill.

 1) INC2824902 - First Party charge cancellation issues in Vista
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a first party charge is cancelled and the bill's Principal Balance is 
 auto-decreased to zero, any remaining Interest Balance, Administrative 
 Cost Balance, Court Costs and Marshall Fees for the bill do not clear. 
 This will leave the veteran's bill with a balance that they should not be 
 responsible for paying, since the charge was cancelled. 
  
 If a first party charge is cancelled and the bill status is 'SUSPENDED', 
 the decrease does not reduce the Principal Balance. This results in an 
 incorrect balance when re-establishing the bill. If noticed, a manual 
 decrease is needed to reduce the bill amount to the correct balance. This 
 process creates an unnecessary manual work review, as well as creating 
 the possibility the Veteran is billed and referred to collection for an
 invalid charge.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PRCASER1 and RCBEUTR2 have been modified to ensure that when a 
 decrease reduces a bill to zero that any remaining Interest Balance, 
 Administrative Cost Balance, Court Costs and Marshall Fees are exempted 
 via an auto-adjustment. Modifications have also been made to ensure that 
 when a cancellation decrease passes through the auto-decrease handler, the
 reduction is now permissible on a bill with a 'SUSPENDED' status.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed-up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE 
 is then used to install the backed-up routines onto the VistA system.
