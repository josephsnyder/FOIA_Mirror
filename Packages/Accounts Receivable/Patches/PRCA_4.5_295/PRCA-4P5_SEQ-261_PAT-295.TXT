 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should take less than a minute to install.
  
 DO NOT QUEUE the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern are the options below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option. Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked. Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
