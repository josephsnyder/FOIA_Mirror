Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues. First, this will allow the entry of 
 a larger number for the unit cost in the NEW BILL (ENTER) option. The
 second change is for a data privacy issue where the veteran's full  
 name and partial SSN were showing in a message subject line.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000063407 COA-0103-21425 UNIT COST LIMITATION
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There are certain instances when the unit cost for an item billed and
    recorded in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file (#430) is more than the maximum
    limit of 999999.00, which is coded in the attributes for the UNIT COST
    sub-field (#4) of the DESCRIPTION field (#106) of file (#430), resulting
    in the possibility of entering more than one bill for the same item(s).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch includes a partial of file (#430), where the maximum limit
    for numeric sub-field (#4) is increased from six to seven characters 
    (9999999). The corresponding TOTAL AMOUNT (#6) numeric sub-field maximum
    limit is increased from eight to nine characters (999999999) as well as
    the FY ORIGINAL AMOUNT (#7) numeric sub-field of the FISCAL YEAR 
    (#1) multiple max. limit is increased from six to nine characters
    (999999999). For this issue, seven routines and three templates have
    been modified to allow printing space for the changes.

    The following is a list of files included in this patch:

                                         DATE  SEC.  COMES  SITE   RSLV
    FILE #  NAME                         DD    CODE  W/FILE DATA   PTS
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    430     ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE          YES   NO   NO             NO
    Partial DD: subDD: 430.01     fld: 7
                subDD: 430.02     fld: 4
                                  fld: 6
  
    The following maximum length controlled by a hard code to enter the
    Increase Principal Balance is increased from 99999 to 9999999 in the
    Increase Adjustment [PRCAC TR INCREASE] option.
  
     Enter the INCREASE Adjustment AMOUNT, from .01 to 9999999.99.
       INCREASE PRINCIPAL BALANCE BY: xxxxxxxx
  
     Response must be no greater than 9999999.99.
  
 2. HD0000000163018 Patient name/partial SSN showing up in message subject
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Sites receive the decrease adjustment bulletins showing the veteran's
    full name with a portion of their SSN on an automatic (or a manual)
    adjustment subject line.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PRCASER1 to delete the veteran name with SSN from the
    subject line and add the first letter of the patient's last name and
    the last 4-digits of the SSN to the bulletin instead. The bulletin is
    the one sent to the PRCA ADJUSTMENT TRANS mail group to indicate that a
    decrease transaction for a bill has been created and a decrease
    adjustment has automatically been applied in the balance (or that a
    manual adjustment is necessary).
