 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD201657 All Third Party Pharmacy Data Not Transmitted To ARC
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The CBO AR Data Extract process didn't pick up all the third party 
 pharmacy bills when there are no procedures but revenue codes on the
 bills.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The extract software in routine RCXVDC4 has been modified to work in the 
 following manner to extract procedure/charge data for a single claim.
  
  1. Separately extract all procedures and charges to fix the procedure and
     charge codes not correctly linked by the extract.
  2. For each procedure record, find the matching charge record by matching
     CPT codes to create a procedure-charge pair. If a matching charge
     record can't be found for a procedure record, create a pair with a 
     blank charge record.
  3. For each remaining (unmatched) charge record, leave the CPT code in
     blank and create a pair with a blank procedure code.
  
 Also routine RCXVDC has been modified to not send out the procedure header
 or the revenue code header if there are no procedures or revenue codes
 associated with the bills. Routine RCXVFTP has been modified to update
 the USER ID to correspond to the new one used to connect to the test
 directory at ARC.
