This patch is being implemented in support of the "AR Changes for Deposit
"BLD",7621,1,2,0)
Ticket Number" project. This is an enhancement to the Accounts Receivable
"BLD",7621,1,3,0)
(AR) System to allow for 9 Digit Deposit Ticket Numbers and to prevent
"BLD",7621,1,4,0)
users from entering Deposit Ticket Numbers beginning with 669.
"BLD",7621,1,5,0)
 
"BLD",7621,1,6,0)
This change is a result of a mandate by the Department of Treasury to use
"BLD",7621,1,7,0)
their contracted bank for all credit card processing.  To prevent a loss
"BLD",7621,1,8,0)
in revenue for these credit card transactions, the VA must comply with the
"BLD",7621,1,9,0)
Treasury mandate and be able to accept the new deposit number schema from
"BLD",7621,1,10,0)
the Treasury contracted bank.  This is a high priority project to prevent
"BLD",7621,1,11,0)
loss of revenue and ensure veteran satisfaction by continuing to allow
"BLD",7621,1,12,0)
them to pay their first party bills using credit cards
"BLD",7621,1,13,0)
 
"BLD",7621,1,14,0)
This patch will modify the existing VistA AR application to do the
"BLD",7621,1,15,0)
following:
"BLD",7621,1,16,0)
     a. Expand field length to 9 digits for deposit ticket number to
"BLD",7621,1,17,0)
        accommodate new unique sequence to prevent duplication of deposit
"BLD",7621,1,18,0)
        ticket numbers.
"BLD",7621,1,19,0)
 
"BLD",7621,1,20,0)
        Note: 9-digit deposit ticket numbers will only be allowed for
"BLD",7621,1,21,0)
        payments processed through the AR Automatic Payment Processing
"BLD",7621,1,22,0)
        Server. Manual entry will continue to be limited to 6 digits.
"BLD",7621,1,23,0)
 
"BLD",7621,1,24,0)
     b. Remove the ability for sites to create local deposit tickets that
"BLD",7621,1,25,0)
        begin with the 669 prefix as it is reserved for electronic check
"BLD",7621,1,26,0)
        deposit tickets.
"BLD",7621,1,27,0)
 
"BLD",7621,1,28,0)
No changes were required to allow the 9-digit deposit ticket numbers to be
"BLD",7621,1,29,0)
displayed in the AR Options and Report, or for the interface which send
"BLD",7621,1,30,0)
this data to the FMS system.
"BLD",7621,1,31,0)
