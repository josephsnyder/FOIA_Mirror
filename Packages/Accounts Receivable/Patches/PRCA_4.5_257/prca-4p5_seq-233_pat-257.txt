Description:
============

 The Department of Treasury has changed the bank that processes credit 
 card payments for VHA from Bank of America to Fifth Third Bank. This 
 change will be effective on September 15, 2008. The Chief Business 
 Office (CBO) has requested that this patch be released as an emergency 
 patch to ensure that there is a 100% compliance prior to the September 
 15th cut-off date.
  
 This patch is being implemented in support of the "AR Changes for Deposit 
 Ticket Number" project. This is an enhancement to the Accounts Receivable 
 (AR) System to allow for 9 Digit Deposit Ticket Numbers and to prevent 
 users from entering Deposit Ticket Numbers beginning with 669.
  
 This change is a result of a mandate by the Department of Treasury to use 
 their contracted bank for all credit card processing.  To prevent a loss 
 in revenue for these credit card transactions, the VA must comply with 
 the Treasury mandate and be able to accept the new deposit number schema 
 from the Treasury contracted bank.  This is a high priority project to 
 prevent loss of revenue and ensure veteran satisfaction by continuing to 
 allow them to pay their first party bills using credit cards
  
 This patch will modify the existing VistA AR application to do the
 following:
     a. Expand field length to 9 digits for deposit ticket number to
        accommodate new unique schema preventing duplicate deposit ticket
        numbers.
  
        Note: 9-digit deposit ticket numbers will only be allowed for
        payments processed through the AR Automatic Payment Processing
        Server. Manual entry will continue to be limited to 6 digits.
  
     b. Remove the ability for sites to create local deposit tickets that
        begin with the 669 prefix as it is reserved for electronic check
        deposit tickets.
  
 No changes were required to allow the 9-digit deposit ticket numbers to 
 be displayed in the AR Options and Report, or for the interface which 
 sends this data to the FMS system.
  
 Additional documentation on this project can be found in the project 
 notebook for "AR Changes for Deposit Ticket Number" which is in the 
 VA Office of Enterprise Development (OED) Project Repository (TSPR). The
