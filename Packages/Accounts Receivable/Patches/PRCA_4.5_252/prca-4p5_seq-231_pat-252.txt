Subject: ENHANCEMENT OF EEOB WORKLIST

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Central Business Office (CBO) has requested the inclusion of the
 Billing Provider and the Servicing Provider National Provider Identifiers
 (NPIs) and names to be included on the EEOB Worklist option [RCDPE EDI 
 LOCKBOX WORKLIST]. This patch adds the subfields for Billing Provider NPI
 and the Rendering/Servicing Provider NPI and the Rendering/Servicing
 provider name to the multiple DETAIL ERA ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file
 (#344.4).  The Billing and Rendering/Servicing provider NPIs will be
 included in the 835ERA message transmitted by the Austin Information
 Technology Center (AITC) to the facilities.
  
 The Servicing Provider NPI and name are stored in the same fields on the
 X12N 835 (835) as the Rendering Provider NPI and name and are distinguished
 from the Rendering Provider by the Rendering Provider NPI Type field of the
 835.  A Rendering Provider NPI Type of 1 is for an individual (Rendering)
 NPI and a type of 2 is for an Organizational/Facility (Servicing) type of
 NPI.
  
 This Data will be automatically extracted from the line type of
 'Header Data' for the Billing provider NPI located in piece 18 of that line
 and from line type 10, piece 16 for the Rendering Provider NPI, piece 17
 for the Rendering NPI Type, piece 18 for the Rendering Provider Last Name
 and piece 19 for the Rendering provider First Name and stored in the
 ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4).  For organization/facility
 type of NPIs the complete organization/facility name is transmitted in the
 Rendering Provider Last Name field and the Rendering Provider First Name
 will be null.  The Rendering Provider Last Name and the Rendering Provider
 First Name will be combined into 'LastName,FirstName' prior to storage in
 the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4) if the Rendering Provider
 First Name is not null.
  
 If the returned Servicing/Rendering Provider NPI is not in the proper
 format it will not be stored in the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file
 (#344.4) and a comment will be included on the EEOB Worklist explaining
 that the NPI was not of a legal format on the 835ERA message.
  
 Also included with the NPIs and names of the providers, found on the 835ERA
 message sent from AITC and being displayed on the EEOB Worklist will be
 displayed the NPIs and names of the providers as found on the original
 claim stored in the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) as a means for rapid
 verification that the providers submitted on the claim are the same ones
 being returned on the 835ERA message. Documentation will be sent out at a 
 later date detailing the changes incorporated with this patch.

 ************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 Testing at the Beta Sites revealed that the data getting populated into 
 the IDENTITY TYPE QUALIFIER (#.2) field of the ERA DETAIL subfile 
 (#344.41) of the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4) was not 
 always correct as a value of '0' was sometimes getting sent by the AITC 
 in the 835s. The AITC has corrected the problem on their end but the 
 data at the sites still needs checked and corrected if necessary.  The
 RC45P252 Accounts Receivable post-install routine delivered with
 PRCA*4.5*252 will loop through each entry in the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE
 ADVICE file (#344.4) and change every IDENTITY TYPE QUALIFIER (#2) field
 value that is set to a '0' to the correct value of null. When the
 post-install process is complete, a MailMan message will be sent to the 
 installer of the patch confirming that the process has completed.
