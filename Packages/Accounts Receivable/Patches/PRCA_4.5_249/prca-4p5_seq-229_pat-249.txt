 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD181433 OBR DATA IS DELETED
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site reported that they were unable to reconcile National Database (NDB)
  reports due to the OBR data that should be retained in the Integrated 
  Supply Management System/Financial Management System (ISMS/FMS) TRANS
  (#423.6) file for 60 days but it is being deleted by the following day.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine RCFMOBR to correct the DATE in FM format to prevent
  the OBR data being deleted incorrectly.
  
 2. HD97141 RCDPEX32 coding error
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The electronic Explanation of Benefits (EOB) exception processing routine
  RCDPEX32 is calling the input function $$DUP^IBCEOB where the parameters
  are reversed.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine RCDPEX32 to correct the parameters in the input function
  $$DUP^IBCEOB.
  
 3. HD177606 Billing Error *.OB
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site reported that some of the billing information was missing when they
  used the Refer Bill(s) to Regional Counsel (RC) action in the
  Review/Refer TP Bills to RC [PRCAC RC REVIEW/REFER] option.
  
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine RCRCXM1 to pick up the provider ID, group name and group
  number that are missing in the transmission message.
  
 4. HD180328 Routine PRCASVC needs review
  
  Problem:
  --------
  There is a problem in routine PRCASVC when it calls the function
  $$GETFUNDB^RCXFMSUF which always fails with an <UNDEFINED> error.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified routine PRCASVC to fix the problem with the DA variable being
  killed in Integrated Billing, thus avoiding the <UNDEFINED> error.
  
 5. HD185155 reprinting statements
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site reported that the Social Security Number (SSN) is printing for 
  patients on the reprinted statements when using the Reprint Patient
  Statements [PRCAE PR STATEMENT] option. Site suggested using the station
  number plus slash followed by the last-4 digit SSN.
  
  Resolution
  ----------
  Modified routines PRCAGST and PRCAGST1 to replace the whole SSN with the
  the station number plus slash followed by the last 4-digit SSN.
