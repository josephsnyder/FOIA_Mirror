Subject: PAY-TO PROVIDER API CALL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates one routine in the option EDI Lockbox 3rd Party 
 Exceptions [RCDPE EXCEPTION PROCESSING]. An Integrated Billing (IB) API is
 being used by this option to retrieve the default Pay-to Provider 
 telephone number.
  
 When an electronic EOB is received in error at a site, EDI Lockbox has
 functionality to transfer that EOB electronically to another site. The IB
 SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) contains the Pay-to Provider telephone
 number. This telephone number is the contact information for the
 receiving site to use to contact the sending site if there are questions
 regarding the EOB. Accounts Receivable needs to be able to retrieve this
 telephone number from the IB Site Parameters in order for it to be
 included in the transferred EOB.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to replace a direct global read into the IB 
 SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) with an Integrated Billing API call instead.
