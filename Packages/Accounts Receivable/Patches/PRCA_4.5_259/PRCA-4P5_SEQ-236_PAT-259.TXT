Subject: EX EMP BILL NOT GOING TO TREASURY OFFSET PROGRAM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the issue of ex-employee bills not being sent to the
 Treasury Offset Program (TOP) because the third letter is not printed if
 the bill is less than $25. Before ex-employee bills are referred to TOP 
 the third letter has to have been printed.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ---------------  
  
 HD0000000234915 -  Ex employee bill not going to TOP
  
       Problem
       --------
       A site reported that ex-employee bills that are less than $25 are
       not transferring to TOP, resulting in them being non-compliant in
       their Fiscal Quality Assurance Management (FQAM) monthly audit.  
       Upon further research it was discovered that Ex-Employees, Current
       Employees, Vendors, Emergency/ Humanitarian, Ineligible Hospital,
       ChampVA Subsistence and Tricare Patients, the third letter is not
       being printed for each bill less than $25.  In order to be eligible
       for referral to TOP, the bill must have the third letter printed.
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       Modified routine ^PRCAGF so that any bill with a current balance
       greater than $0 will cause the third letter to print.
