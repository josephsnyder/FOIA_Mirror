Subject: CSE Enhancements DebtMgmt and Rerefer

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PRCA*4.5*350 modifies existing, and provides new, functionality 
 for re-referring bills to Treasury for Cross-Servicing and to stop 
 or reactivate Cross-Servicing referrals for a single Debtor or an 
 entire Site and the capability to report on these functions.
 Also included is a new Catastrophically Disabled Exempt Copay Charge
 Report.
  
  
 1) [PRCA SITE PARAMETER] "Site Parameter Edit" modified with the 
    addition of a new option [PRCA STOP SITE] "Stop/Reactivate New 
    Referrals to TCSP". This option allows a user to stop or reactivate 
    Cross-Servicing referrals for an entire facility in such events as 
    a FEMA designated disaster location.
  
 2) [RCTCSP STOP] "Stop/Reactivate TCSP Referral for a Bill" modified.
    Option name changed to (Stop/Reactivate TCSP Referral) along with 
    logic to allow a user to choose between stopping or reactivating 
    referrals for a bill or for a debtor.
  
 3) [RCTCSP STOP REACTIVATE REPORT] "Cross-Servicing Stop Reactivate 
    Report" modified to allow a user to specify whether to run the 
    report by Bill or by Debtor.
  
 4) [RCTCSP REREFER BILL] "Refer Returned CS Bill" added which allows 
    a User to request a re-referral of a bill, update a re-referral 
    request, or cancel a re-referral request.
  
 5) [RCTCSP REREFER BILL REPORT] "Cross-Servicing Re-Referred Bills 
    Report" added which allows a User to run a report showing all 
    re-referred bills.
  
 6) [PRCAY FULL ACCOUNT PROFILE] "Full Account Profile" modified to 
    display a re-referred to Cross-Servicing message and the date of 
    the re-referral for the bill.  Modifications were also done to 
    remove multiple line items of CS Rejects (rejections) and instead 
    have a single line display for the last CS Reject Code and the last
    CS Reject Date.
  
 7) [PRCAY ACCOUNT PROFILE] "Brief Account Profile" modified to display 
    a debt re-referred to Cross-Servicing message and the date of the 
    re-referral for the bill.  Modifications were also done to remove 
    multiple line items of CS Rejects (rejections) and instead have a 
    single line display for the last CS Reject Code and the last CS 
    Reject Date.
  
 8) [PRCAC TRANS PROFILE] "Transaction Profile" modified to display the 
    transaction types for a re-referral request, cancellation, or 
    completed (post batch job) re-referral.
  
 9) [RCDP BILL PROFILE] "Bill Profile" modified to display Debt 
    Re-Referred to Cross-Servicing and CS Re-Referred Date for bills 
    that have been re-referred. 
  
 10)[PRCAC PROFILE] "Profile of Accounts Receivable" modified to display 
    Debt Re-Referred to Cross-Servicing and CS Re-Referred Date for 
    bills that have been re-referred.
  
 11)[RCTCSP RECONCIL REPORT] "Reconciliation Report - Cross-Servicing" 
    modified to not include returned bills that have since been 
    re-referred to Cross-Servicing.
  
 12)[RCTCSP RECONCILIATION WORKLIST] "Reconciliation List Manager" 
    modified to not include returned bills that have since been 
    re-referred to Cross-Servicing.
  
 13)[PRCA CD EXEMPT COPAY CHRG RPT] "Catastrophically Disabled Exempt 
    Copay Charge Rpt" added which allows a User to run a report for
    copay charges with an appropriation fund of "528703" for medical 
    care or an appropriation fund of "528701" for Rx copayments, with 
    a distinct date of service or Rx fill date on or after the 
    co-payment exemption effective date, for Veterans who are 
    Catastrophically Disabled.

 Patch Installation:
 -------------------
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 To avoid disruptions, this patch should be installed during non-peak hours
 when there is minimal activity on the system and there are no Accounts
 Receivable users on the system. 
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
 *strongly* recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to
 minimize potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than
 10 minutes to install. 
  
 Installation Instructions:
  
 1.  If this release is provided using PackMan, choose the PackMan message
     containing this build. Then select the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan 
     option to load the build.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation Menu.  From this menu, 
  
     A. Select the Verify Checksums in Transport Global option to confirm 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global. 
        When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch or build name
        PRCA*4.5*350.
  
     B. Select the Backup a Transport Global option to create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. 
  
     C. You may also elect to use the following options:

 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
  
 The back-out plan for VistA applications is complex and is not able to be 
 a one size fits all strategy. The general strategy for VistA software
 back-out is to repair the code with a follow-up patch. The development 
 team recommends that sites log a ticket if it is a nationally released
 patch with national VistA - Accounts Receivable support; otherwise, 
 during testing the test site should contact the development team directly
 for specific solutions to their unique problems.
  
 Although it is unlikely due to care in collecting approved requirements,
 Software Quality Assurance (SQA) review and multiple testing stages 
 (Primary Developer, Secondary Developer, and Component Integration
 Testing) a back-out decision due to major issues with this patch could
 occur during site Mirror Testing, Site Production Testing or after
 National Release to the Field. The strategy would depend on during which
 of these stages the decision is made. If during Site Production Testing,
 unless the patch produces catastrophic problems, the normal VistA response
 would be for a new version of the test patch correcting defects to be
 produced, retested and upon successfully passing development team testing
 would be resubmitted to the site for testing. If the defect was not 
 discovered until after national release but during the 90 day warranty 
 period,
 a new patch will be entered into the National Patch Module on Forum and 
 go through all the necessary milestone reviews etc. as an emergency patch.
 After 90 days, the VistA Maintenance Program would produce the new patch,
 either to correct the defective components or to back-out.
  
 During the VistA Installation Procedure of the KIDS build, the installer 
 can back up the modified routines using the 'Backup a Transport Global'
 action. The installer can restore the routines using the MailMan message
 that were saved prior to installing the patch. All software components
 (routines and other items) must be restored to their previous state at the
 same time and in conjunction with restoration of the data. This back-out
 may need to include a database cleanup process. 
  
 Please log a ticket with national VistA - Accounts Receivable support for 
 assistance if the installed patch that needs to be backed out contains
 anything at all besides routines before trying to back-out the patch. If
 the installed patch that needs to be backed out includes a pre or post
 install routine, please log a ticket with national VistA - Accounts 
 Receivable support before attempting the back-out.
