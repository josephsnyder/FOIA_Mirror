Subject: E-CLAIMS PLUS ITERATION 3 PHASE 2

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem in the Accounts Receivable (AR) option Bill
 Comment Log [PRCA BILL COMMENT]. If the user selects a claim that has not
 yet been authorized in Integrated Billing (IB) and sent to AR, the error
 message that the user sees says the claim has been cancelled even when it
 has not been cancelled. This patch enhances the error messages.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD64533   NIN-1204-40968  CLAIM SHOWING CANCELLED
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket:
 -----------------------------
 1. HD64533   NIN-1204-40968  CLAIM SHOWING CANCELLED
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When trying to add an AR comment using the Bill Comment Log [PRCA 
 BILL COMMENT] option for a claim that has not yet been authorized, the
 user receives the following message:
  
    **  This bill was cancelled in IB before it was passed to AR.  **
  
 This message is displayed for all claims that have not yet been authorized
 and passed to AR, including claims that are still in a REQUEST MRA status,
 or claims still in an ENTERED, NOT REVIEWED status in IB. The error
 message that is displayed is incorrect.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 AR comments may not be entered for claims that have not yet been
 authorized. However, the error messages that are displayed will be more 
 descriptive about why the selected claim is not valid.
  
 For claims still in IB with a status of ENTERED, NOT REVIEWED, the error 
 message will be:
  
   ** You cannot add AR Comments to an Entered/Not Reviewed claim. **
  
 For claims still in IB with a status of REQUEST MRA, the error message 
 will be:
  
   ** You cannot add AR Comments to an MRA Request claim. **
  
 For claims that were cancelled in IB before being sent to AR, the 
 error message will be:
  
   ** You cannot add AR Comments to a claim Cancelled/not passed to AR. **
