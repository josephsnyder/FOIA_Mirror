 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ====================
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
        
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
      
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
      
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
      
      
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
