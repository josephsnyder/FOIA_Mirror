Subject: PBM EXTRACTS ENHANCEMENT SUPPORT

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a request which supports the Pharmacy Benefits 
 Management (PBM) Extracts Enhancement #3 project. In order to allow 
 the retransmission of only those patients who have had demographic 
 updates, Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 was modified to build an 
 entry for retransmission in PBM PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS file (#59.9)
 whenever the FIRST SERVICE DATE field (#.07) in the PHARMACY PATIENT 
 file (#55) is updated.
  
 This patch adds a New-Style cross-reference to the FIRST SERVICE DATE 
 field (#.07) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). When the FIRST SERVICE
 DATE field (#.07) is updated for a patient then the cross-reference is 
 triggered and the patient is queued for transmission.
  
 The following applications were also updated as part of the PBM Extracts 
 Enhancement #3 project:
