Subject: REPORT OF REFORMATTED LOCAL POSSIBLE DOSES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Institute of Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) recommends 
 providing a space between the strength and units.  Based upon 
 this it was decided to add a space between the strength (dose) 
 and units wherever they are displayed for Possible Dosages.
 PSS*1.0*78 created an API that other code can call and send
 the Possible Dose and it will reformat it with a leading zero
 for values less than one and add a space between the dose and
 units.  The question arose as to whether Local Possible Doses
 should also be sent through the API to be reformatted.  Since 
 Local Possible Dose is a free text field in the data dictionary,
 this patch will create a report to verify that after the Local
 Possible Dose is sent through the new API it will be formatted
 correctly.
 This patch will create a post install routine that will loop 
 through the Drug file (#50) and get all the Local Possible Doses
 for each drug and call a copy of the API to reformat it.  A
 report will then be generated that will display the drug ien, 
 drug name, original Local Possible Dose and the reformatted Local
 Possible Dose.  The report will be sent to the holders of the 
 PSNMGR key.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 HD000000067761 Possible Doses - no space between dose and units
    
 Problem: 
 --------
 Patch PSS*1.0*78 created an API that other code can call and 
 send the Possible Dose and it will reformat it with a leading 
 zero for values less than one and add a space between the dose
 and units.  The question arose as to whether Local Possible Doses
 should also be sent through the API to be reformatted.  Since 
 Local Possible Dose is a free text field in the data dictionary,
 this patch will create a report to verify that after the Local
 Possible Dose is sent through the new API it will be formatted
 correctly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A Post-Install routine will create a report to loop through all 
 Local Possible Doses for all drugs in the Drug file (#50) and 
 reformat them using a copy of the new API developed with patch 
 PSS*1.0*78. **This patch does not actually change any entry in the 
 Local Possible Dosage field in the Drug File.**
   
 The report will be sent to the holders of the PSNMGR key and 
 will display the drug ien, drug name, original Local 
 Possible Dose and reformatted Local Possible Dose.  
  
 Once the report has been received, the holder should review the entire 
 report to identify any drug/dosage combinations that appear to be 
 incorrect.
  
 Examples:  INFLUENZA VIRUS VACCINE 2004-2005 (#7642)
                         0.5ML
                         00.5 ML
  
            BUDESONIDE 0.25MG/2ML INH SUSP 2ML (#524)
                         ONE AMPULE (0.25MG/2ML)
                         ONE AMPULE (0.25 MG / 2 ML )
  
 *************************IMPORTANT******************************** 
 *After identifying any drug/dosage combinations that appear to be*
