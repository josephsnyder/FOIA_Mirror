Description:
============

 This patch will address defects introduced by patch PSS*1.0*146 and 
 addresses the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) 
 part of New Service Request (NSR) 20110308.
  
 1) Remedy Ticket #925153 - When adding a new IV Additive to the IV
 ADDITIVES File (#52.6), and the user is at the GENERIC DRUG prompt, there
 is no way to exit from the prompt. The input does not allow the user
 to use the caret (^) to exit. The code that was modified in routine
 PSSVIDRG for patch PSS*1.0*146 changed the code at the GENERIC DRUG prompt
 and introduced this issue. Patch PSS*1.0*174 will fix this problem by
 properly allowing the user to exit the GENERIC DRUG prompt by using the
 caret (^).
  
 2) Remedy Ticket #719799 - Another issue addressed with this patch is the
 wording when the user is linking an IV Additive to a Generic Drug at the
 GENERIC DRUG prompt in menu option ADditives File [PSSJI DRUG]. It was
 unclear which drug name was the Additive and which was the Generic Drug
 when selecting. This patch will remove the uncertainty by clearly stating
 to the user which is the IV Additive and which is the Generic Drug.  For
 example:
  
 PRINT NAME: CEFAZOLIN// 
 GENERIC DRUG: CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ// CEFAZ
      1   CEFAZOLIN OPTH SOLN 50MG/CC  (15CC) 
      2   CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ           AM115     
      3   CEFAZOLIN SOD 1GM INJ           AM115     N/F   
 CHOOSE 1-3: 3  CEFAZOLIN SOD 1GM INJ         AM115     N/
  
 You are about to change the GENERIC DRUG linked to this ADDITIVE.
 ADDITIVE CEFAZOLIN is currently linked to 
 GENERIC DRUG CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ.
  
 Are you sure you want to link ADDITIVE CEFAZOLIN
 to GENERIC DRUG CEFAZOLIN SOD 1GM INJ? No//
  
 3) Addresses the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) Pharmacy Data Management 
 (PDM) part of New Service Request (NSR) 20110308 by adding a STRENGTH
 (#19) field to the IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6). The new STRENGTH (#19)
 field can be populated when adding a new IV Additive or when editing
 an existing IV Additive via menu option ADditives File [PSSJI DRUG].
  
 For example:
  
 PRINT NAME: CEFAZOLIN// 
 GENERIC DRUG: CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ//       AM115
 USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY: YES// 
 DRUG UNIT: GM// 
 STRENGTH: 1// ??
  
 This field identifies the numeric amount of medication that is
 provided by one unit-of-use for the identified product.
  
 For example, if one vial contains 50 MG of medication, the
 STRENGTH will be entered as '50'.  The DRUG UNIT of 'MG'
 is populated by the DRUG UNIT (#2) field.
  
  
 Whenever a lookup is performed on the IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6), the 
 STRENGTH (#19) field will display next to the NAME (#.01) field
 with the words "Additive Strength:" and then its value.
 Additionally, the DRUG UNIT (#2) field will be appended to the
 STRENGTH (#19) field.  If the STRENGTH (#19) field is not
 populated for the IV Additive, the text "N/A" will display, and
 The DRUG UNIT (#2) field will not display.
  
 For example:
  
 Select IV TYPE: PIGGYBACK.
 Select ADDITIVE: CEFAZOL
      1   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1 GM  
                IV ROOM ONLY
      2   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 2 GM  
                
      3   CEFAZOLIN PREMIX         Additive Strength: N/A  
                
 CHOOSE 1-3:
  
 This new STRENGTH field can also be populated from DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS
 DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option.
  
 Select OPTION NAME: PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT       Drug Enter/Edit
  
 Select DRUG GENERIC NAME: CEFAZOLIN SOD 500MG INJ         AM115

   You are about to change the GENERIC DRUG linked to this ADDITIVE.
   ADDITIVE CEFAZTEST3 is not currently linked to any
   GENERIC DRUG .
  
   Are you sure you want to link ADDITIVE CEFAZTEST3
   to GENERIC DRUG CEFAZOLIN SOD 500MG INJ? No// Y  (Yes)
 USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY: Y  YES
 DRUG UNIT: MG// 
 STRENGTH: 275
 NUMBER OF DAYS FOR IV ORDER: 
  
 4) Additionally, this patch makes a small enhancement to the display of 
 Quick Codes during the selection of an IV ADDITIVE when executing the 
 ADditives File [PSSJI DRUG] or Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] 
 options when viewing/editing the IV Additives. If there are QUICK CODES
 defined for the IV ADDITIVE, the STRENGTH (#1) and USUAL IV SCHEDULE (#4)
 fields from the QUICK CODE Subfile (#52.61) will display next to the QUICK
 CODE. If the fields are not defined for the QUICK CODE, "N/A" will be
 displayed.
  
 For example:
 Select IV ADDITIVES PRINT NAME: CEF
   Lookup: PRINT NAME
      1   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1 GM  
        - CFZ28 -        Quick Code Strength: 2 GM     Schedule: Q8H
        - CF1D550 -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: N/A
      2   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1.5 GM  
                VISN
      3   CEFEPIME HCL         Additive Strength: N/A   
                
        - MAX1Q12 -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: Q12H
        - MAX2Q12 -        Quick Code Strength: 2 GM     Schedule: Q12H
  
 5) This patch will also enhance the capabilities of the IV ADDITIVES
 File (#52.6) and IV SOLUTIONS File (#52.7) so that a user can enter
 a new additive or solution that has the same name as an existing entry.
 Previously, a Fileman workaround had to be used to enter an identically
 named entry. With this patch, if the user types in a name that already
 exists in the file, they will first be presented with a list of available
 selections. If the user scrolls through the list without selecting an
 entry, they will be presented with the prompt to add a new entry.
  
 For example - IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6)
  
 CHOOSE 1-2: 1  PSSJI DRUG     ADditives File
 ADditives File
 Select IV ADDITIVES PRINT NAME: TESTDRUG
   Lookup: PRINT NAME

      3   TESTDRUG         Additive Strength: 5 GM  
  
      4   TESTDRUG         Additive Strength: 12 GM  
  
 CHOOSE 1-4: 
   Are you adding 'TESTDRUG' as a new IV ADDITIVES (the 77TH)? No// Y  
  (Yes)
  
  
 For example - IV SOLUTIONS File (#52.7)

 CHOOSE 1-3: 
  
   Are you adding '0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE' as 
     a new IV SOLUTIONS (the 32ND)? No// Y  (Yes)
  
 6) Remedy Ticket #925153 - This patch will also allow the addition of
 identically named IV ADDITIVES and IV SOLUTIONS from the DRUG ENTER/EDIT
 [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option when linking an additive or solution
 to the drug.
  
 For example - new additive:

 A new ICR #5895 was created for one-time use only. It allows the 
 post-install routine PSS0174 to directly set ^DD(52.6,0,"ID",19) for the
 display of the STRENGTH (#19) field in lookups.
  
 Note: The post-install routine PSS0174 will be automatically deleted from 
 your system upon completion of the installation.

 925153 - When adding a new IV Additive to the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6), 
 and the user is at the GENERIC DRUG prompt, there is no way to exit from 
 the prompt. The input does not allow the user to use the up caret (^) to 
 exit.
  
 Prior to patch PSS*1.0*146, a Fileman workaround had to be used to enter 
 an identically named entry. I am requesting a better way to create an 
 identical IV ADDITIVE.
