 ************************************************************
 This patch will change the input transform and add helptext to 
 the DEA SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) on the DRUG file (#50). As well
 as send out a mailman message with a list of drugs that should be
 checked as the change of scheduling may cause the allowance of
 renews and refills to change. This patch will not directly change
 the functionality of the DEA codes, however, the input transform
 has been changed to allow entry of the new codes.
  
 The codes that will be changing are 3A, 4A, and 5A. Previously
 these codes did not allow renews or refills. In the new functionality
 they will allow only renews. In order to change them back to the old
 functionality these codes would need to be changed to 3AW, 4AW, or 5AW.
  
 This patch will correct the following issues.

 ---------------------
 The input transform for the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the
