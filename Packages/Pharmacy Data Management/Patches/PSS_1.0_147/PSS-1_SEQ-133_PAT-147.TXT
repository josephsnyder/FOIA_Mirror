Description:
============

 This patch will make some additional enhancements to the Pharmacy
 Re-Engineering (PRE) V. 0.5 Pre-Release functionality that was released in
 patch PSS*1.0*129. This patch also sends out four VistA Security Keys to
 be used in the Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS)
 Application, which will be released at a later date.
  
 The enhancements to the Pre-Release functionality include:
                                   
 1) A new PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group will be created upon installation of
 this patch. This mail group will be used for various purposes, all
 relating to the Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) project.
  
 2) Data from the DOSE UNIT (#4) Field and the NUMERIC DOSE (#5) Field of
 the LOCAL POSSIBLE DOSAGE (#50.0904) Subfile of the DRUG (#50) File will
 be added as display elements to the Lookup into Dispense Drug File
 [PSS LOOK] option and the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option.
  
 3) A VistA Mail message will be sent to the PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group
 when an update is made to the STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File by
 the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) process. This mail message will
 include what was updated, and will also include any automatic mapping
 activities that occurred from the MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.2) File to the
 STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File.
  
 4) The Request Change to Standard Medication Route [PSS MEDICATION ROUTE 
 REQUEST] option has been changed to now refer the requestor to a web site
 to make the request.
  
 5) A new ADDITIVE FREQUENCY (#18) Field has been added to the IV ADDITIVES
 (#52.6) File. This field will be used to provide a default value for the
 Additive Frequency field in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) when
 continuous IV orders with additives are entered. Data will be
 auto-populated by a Post-Install routine for this patch, and this data
 should be reviewed and edited as necessary. This new field can be edited
 using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option or the ADditives
 File [PSSJI DRUG] option. These defaults will not start to appear in CPRS
 until Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) Increments 3 and 4 are released. A new
 IV Additive Report [PSS IV ADDITIVE REPORT] option has also been added,
 and this report, in addition to the current IV Solution Report [PSS IV
 SOLUTION REPORT] option, will now be located under the new IV
 Additive/Solution Reports [PSS ADDITIVE/SOLUTION REPORTS] Menu option,
 which will be located under the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu
 option.
  
 6) The following Security Keys will be brought in with this 
 patch:                               
 PSS_CUSTOM_TABLES_ADMIN
 PSS_CUSTOM_TABLES_APPROVER       
 PSS_CUSTOM_TABLES_REL_MAN 
 PSS_CUSTOM_TABLES_REQUESTOR 
 These PSS-namespaced VistA Security Keys are to be used in the Pharmacy 
 Enterprise Customization System (PECS) application. The PECS application 
 will allow the VA National Drug File Support Group to customize order 
 check data that we will be receiving from First DataBank, which will be 
 our Order Check Vendor. On the initial release of PECS, the only users of
 the application will be members of the National Drug File Support Group.
 There is no need for these keys to be assigned to anyone, unless there is
 a member of that support group at your site, and then they should request
 the Keys from whoever issues Security Keys.
  
 A Mail Message will be sent to the PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group and the
 patch installer upon completion of patch installation.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The Environment Check routine PSS147EN will perform the following task:
  
 1) Create the PSS ORDER CHECKS VistA Mail group. The patch installer will
    be prompted to enter a Mail Group Organizer. If an Organizer is not
    entered, or the mail group cannot be created, the install will be
    aborted. If the Mail Group already exists upon install, these actions
    will not occur.
   
 The Post-Init routine PSS147PO will perform the following tasks:
  
 1) Populate the new ADDITIVE FREQUENCY (#18) Field of the IV ADDITIVES 
    (#52.6) File. This action will only occur on the first install, just in
    case there are subsequent installs.
 2) Replace the IV Solution Report [PSS IV SOLUTION REPORT] option on the
    Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu option with the IV
    Additive/Solution Reports [PSS ADDITIVE/SOLUTION REPORTS] Menu option,
    and place the IV Additive Report [PSS IV ADDITIVE REPORT] option and
    the IV Solution Report [PSS IV SOLUTION REPORT] option under the IV
    Additive/Solution Reports [PSS ADDITIVE/SOLUTION REPORTS] Menu option.
 3) Attach the PSS MED ROUTE RECEIVE Protocol as an Item to the XUMF MFS
    EVENTS protocol.
 4) Send a mail message to the patch installer and to the members of the
    PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group indicating that the install is complete.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch should not be installed when Pharmacy Data Management options
 and National Drug File options are being used. Also, it should not be
 installed at the same time any National Drug File patches are being
 installed, and that includes DATA UPDATES patches, PMI MAPPING patches,
 and PMI UPDATE patches. And since this patch exports so many Pharmacy Data
 Management components that could be invoked from other Clinical
 Applications, we recommend it should be installed during Non-Peak hours
 for all Clinical Applications, and that includes tasked jobs from Clinical
 Applications. 
  
  
 Install Time - less than 10 minutes
  
 ************ PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 Make sure you have the name of the Pharmacy ADPAC or a designee, that 
 should become the Organizer of the new PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group. This 
 Mail Group will be used extensively for VistA mail messages regarding 
 Pharmacy order checks upon installation of Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE)
 Increments 3 and 4, and prior to that this Mail Group will receive
 messages regarding any automatic updates done to the STANDARD MEDICATION
 ROUTES (#51.23) File.
