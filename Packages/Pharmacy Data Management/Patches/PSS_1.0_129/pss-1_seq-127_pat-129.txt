Description:
============

 This patch provides the functionality needed to prepare for the release of
 Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) V. 0.5, which will change the current
 Pharmacy Order Checking system from using the data stored in VistA to
 using data from the First DataBank (FDB) commercial database system. There
 is set-up work that is required to be completed prior to the installation
 of PRE V. 0.5, and this patch provides the tools needed to complete that
 set-up work. The set-up need not be completed immediately after patch 
 installation, but should be completed before the release of PRE V. 0.5,
 which is currently scheduled for August 2009. This set-up work can be
 broken down into four main areas:
  
 1) Local Medication Route Mapping
 2) Local Possible Dosage Setup
 3) Administration Schedule/Medication Instruction Review
 4) IV Solution Review 
  
 Please refer to the PRE V.0.5 Pre-Release Implementation Guide for 
 detailed set-up instructions.
  
 Also please note that a Standards and Conventions Committee exemption has
 been granted for routines PSSDSDAT and PSSDSPON to be over the 15,000 byte
 limit for non-commented code. These routines are only invoked during the
 post installation process.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Upon installation of the patch, the ENVIRONMENT CHECK routine PSS129EN 
 will prompt the patch installer to enter at least one person, (other than 
 the installer), to receive the VistA mail message when the POST-INIT 
 routine has completed. This person should be the Pharmacy ADPAC or a 
 designee.
  
 The POST-INIT routine PSSPO129 will perform the following eight tasks:
 1) Set the Read Access of the STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File to 
    "Pp".
 2) Set the Read Access of the DOSE UNITS (#51.24) File to "Pp".
 3) Initiate the VHA Unique Identifier (VUID) population for the STANDARD 
    MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File.
 4) Rebuild the Pharmacy Data Management menu structure.
 5) Populate the EXCLUDE FROM DOSAGE CHECKS (#11) Field of the DOSAGE FORM
    (#50.606) File.
 6) Map entries from the MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.2) File to entries in the
    STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File.
 7) Auto-populate the new DOSE UNIT (#4) and NUMERIC DOSE (#5) fields in 
    the LOCAL POSSIBLE DOSAGE (#50.0904) SubFile of the DRUG (#50) File.
 8) Generate the mail message indicating the POST-INIT routine has run
    to completion.
  
 Once the standardization process in step number 3 is complete, from that 
 point forward the STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File will 
 automatically be updated by the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) process 
 with any additions or changes.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch should be installed when no Pharmacy Data Management options 
 and no National Drug File options are being used. And since this patch 
 exports so many Pharmacy Data Management components that could be 
 invoked from other Clinical Applications, we recommend it should be 
 installed during Non-Peak hours for all Clinical Applications, and that 
 includes tasked jobs from Clinical Applications. 
  
  
 Install Time - less than 10 minutes
  
 ************ PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 Because of the rebuilding of the Pharmacy Data Management menu structure 
 as part of this patch, any locally added options under the Pharmacy Data 
 Management [PSS MGR] menu option, or any of it's sub-menus, may no longer
 be attached to these PSS menus after patch install. Please review the
 Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] menu option and it's sub-menus prior to
 install to make note of any locally added options, so they can be
 re-attached after install.
  
 Also make sure you have the name of the Pharmacy ADPAC or a designee, 
 that should know when the POST INIT of this patch is complete. That 
 name(s) should be entered when the ENVIRONMENT CHECK routine prompts for 
 the recipient(s) of the mail message that will indicate that 
 the installation is complete.
