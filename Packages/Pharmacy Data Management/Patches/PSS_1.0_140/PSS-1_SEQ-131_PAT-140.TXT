Description:
============

 This enhancement is an interim resolution approved by the Inpatient
 Medications Workgroup and Pharmacy Legacy Quarterly Enhancement (PLQE)
 User Group for Patient Safety Issue PSI 08-026, PSPO #852 as described in
 Remedy Ticket HD233682. This patch will help mitigate incorrect medication
 routes being displayed for selection in the Computerized Patient Record
 System V. 3.0 (CPRS).
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Currently, for unit dose orders and Outpatient Pharmacy orders, all
 medication routes for the dosage form of the orderable item are being
 displayed in CPRS as possible medication routes to be selected. Even if
 an orderable item is to be given only Intramuscular (IM), the provider
 sees a dropdown list to select a potentially inappropriate medication
 route of Subcutaneous (SC) or Intravenous (IV).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This enhancement affects both Inpatient Medications unit dose orders
 entered via the Inpatient Medications order dialog in CPRS as well as
 Outpatient Pharmacy orders entered via CPRS. A new parameter will be added
 to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) to support this functionality (see
 below). With this parameter set to YES, CPRS order dialogs will display
 only the default medication route for the orderable item in the medication
 route selection list in CPRS if a default medication route is defined in
 the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). If there is no default 
 medication route defined for the orderable item, then the current 
 functionality will be retained and all possible medication routes for the
 dosage form will be displayed to the provider for selection in CPRS.
 Routine PSSJORDF will be modified for this enhancement.
  
 This enhancement adds the DEFAULT MED ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) to the
 PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) to support the functionality of this patch.  
 The field will serve as a toggle, allowing the site to choose whether they
 want to implement the features of this patch in their system. This field
 is maintained by the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS EDIT] 
 option. The default for this field is YES when first accessing this field
 from this option. This field may be set to YES or NO. An example of
 setting this to YES appears below.

                              functionality. 
             DESCRIPTION:     This field should be marked "YES" if the site
                              prefers the MED ROUTE field (#.06) in the
                              PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) to appear 
                              as the default/only entry during CPRS order
                              entry. If no default medication route is
                              defined in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
                              (#50.7), then the routes from the DOSAGE 
                              FORM file (#50.606) will display.
                                  
                              This field will affect only orders entered via
                              the Inpatient Medications dialog or the
                              Outpatient Medications dialog in CPRS. It will
                              not impact IV Fluids entered via CPRS or orders
                              entered via backdoor Pharmacy.  
  
            TECHNICAL DESCR:  Set of codes. "YES" to display only the
                              default med route in CPRS and "NO" to continue
                              with the current functionality.  
  
 The following table summarizes the functionality of this patch.
 **NOTE** This patch will be exported with the new parameter set to YES.

                                     Nothing pre-populates the selection box.
  
 Additionally, this patch will provide a new option called Default Med 
 Route For OI Report [PSS DEF MED ROUTE OI RPT] that will be added to the 
 Medication Routes Management [PSS MEDICATION ROUTES MGMT] menu. The site 
 can use this report to identify the current default medication route for
 the orderable item. Here is an example of the report:
