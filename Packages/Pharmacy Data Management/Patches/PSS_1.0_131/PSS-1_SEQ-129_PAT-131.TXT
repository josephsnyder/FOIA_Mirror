Description:

 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*65
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*131
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*289
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*384
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*7
  
 The last three patches (PSO*7*289, IB*2*384 and BPS*1*7) will be released 
 in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 3.0.  Patches PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 will 
 be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an implementation 
 dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches, PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 must be installed prior to the 
 installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions please 
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 This patch modifies the Pharmacy Data Management v1.0 application as 
 described below:
  
 1. A new Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Handling code, U
 for Sensitive Drug, was added as a selection to the DEA SPECIAL HDLG
 prompt for DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option. When a signed
 Release of Information (ROI) is on file and the drug is marked with this
 new code, the drug may be third party billable.  Drugs must be manually
 marked with this new code, and this functionality works in conjunction
 with ROI modifications made in IB*2*384.  Please refer to PSS*1*131 
 Release Notes for recommendations on populating certain Drug File entries 
 with the "U" DEA Special Handling designation.
