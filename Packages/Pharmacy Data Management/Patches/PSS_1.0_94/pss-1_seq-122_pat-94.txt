Subject: PHARMACY CHANGES TO SUPPORT CPRS GUI V27 AND IMR PHASE III

Category: 
  - Input Template
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 **WARNING** 
 This patch must be installed immediately before the main Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) GUI v27 host file OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID.  It
 is recommended that PSS*1.0*94 not be installed until the site is ready
 to install the CPRS GUI v27 host file.
  
 1. In support of the project Inpatient Medications Requirements for
 the Special Focus Group Initial Request Analysis (IMR) Phase III, 
 two changes have been made in the input template PSSJ SCHEDULE EDIT. 
 First, if the schedule type is continuous and it is an odd schedule, 
 the system will no longer allow the entry of administration times. 
 Continuous, non-odd schedules will still require administration times.
  
 2. The second IMR change for the input template is if the schedule type
 is on-call, the system will no longer require a frequency. This will
 address remedy ticket HD131460.
  
 3. In support of the CPRS GUI v27 release, the validation of 
 schedules from the GUI has been modified.  The change was
 to allow day-of-week schedules to be entered in the format:
 day@schedule. Schedule, in this case, is an already defined schedule
 such as BID. So, now a day-of-week schedule may be entered as
 MO-WE-FR@BID to signify you want to use the BID administration times 
 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
  
 4. In support of CPRS GUI v27, a modification has been made to the 
 list of available Medication Routes sent back to CPRS from Inpatient
 Pharmacy when using the IV Dialog.  If there is one orderable item
 in the order, Inpatient Pharmacy will return any default med route
 that may be defined in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file #50.7 along
 with any other med routes defined for the DOSAGE FORM file #50.606.  
 Duplicate entries will be removed.  If there is more than one orderable 
 item in the order, Inpatient Pharmacy will return a list of the common
 med routes that match all orderable items.
  
 5. In support of CPRS GUI v27, remedy ticket, HD220080 - "^ in 
 the Schedule field" was addressed.
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Users are allowed to include an "^" in the schedule when placing an 
 order in CPRS GUI v27.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSSGSGUI will be modified to disallow an "^" in the text of a
 schedule.
  
 6. The routine PSS0088 is being deleted with this patch.  The routine
 was part of patch PSS*1.0*88, and was used simply as a tally routine
 to identify medication routes that needed to be reviewed when the
 functionality of PSS*1.0*88 was installed.  The tally routine's
 functionality is no longer necessary, so the routine will be deleted.
  
    
 7. In support of CPRS GUI v27, the array of schedules from the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file #51.1 that is returned to CPRS for schedule
 selection on an order is being modified.  Currently, a site can have
 multiple schedules with the same name for the same package.  The array
 of schedules presented for selection in CPRS GUI v26 only takes the
 schedule with the lowest IEN number in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file
 #51.1 if a duplicate exists.
    With the changes in CPRS GUI v27, if there is a duplicate schedule,
 and if one of them contains ward-specific admin times for the ward
 location of the patient, the schedule returned for inclusion in the
 array of selectable schedules in CPRS will be the one with the ward-
 specific admin times.  If no duplicate has ward-specific admin times
 for the ward location of the patient, the schedule with the lowest
 IEN number will be returned.  If both (or more than one)
 duplicate schedules have ward-specific admin times for the ward
 location of the patient, the schedule with the lowest IEN number in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file #51.1 will be the schedule in the array
 returned to CPRS.
