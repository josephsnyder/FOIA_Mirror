Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.
  
 This patch is being released along with PSO*7*303 and IB*2*405.  These 
 patches can be installed in any order but the full functionality contained
 within these patches will not be available until all 3 patches are
 installed.
  
 This patch modifies the Pharmacy Data Management v1.0 application as 
 described below:
  
 1. A new Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Handling code,'N'
 for Nutritional Supplement, was added as a selection to the DEA SPECIAL
 HDLG prompt for DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option.  Once 
 Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*303 and Integrated Billing patch IB*2*405
 are installed, any drug defined with this new code will be treated in the
 same manner as supply items and investigational drugs.  The'N' DEA Special
 Handling code must be defined manually.
