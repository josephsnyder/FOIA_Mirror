Subject: SCHEDULE EDIT ENHANCEMENTS FOR IMR PHASE 1

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Input Template
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide software enhancements defined by
 Increment 1 of the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Inpatient
 Medications Request (IMR) for Special Focus Group (SFG) Initial Request
 Analysis (IRA). This patch works in conjunction with Inpatient Medications
 V.5.0 patch PSJ*5*113.
  
 PSS*1*143 adds validation checks to the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS
 SCHEDULE EDIT] option to prevent the Standard Administration Times and
 Ward Administration times fields of a schedule from conflicting with the
 schedule's frequency if the frequency is numeric and the schedule type is
 Continuous.
  
 1.  Schedule Edit Validation One
 The system shall validate for frequencies of 1 day (1440 minutes) or
 less that the number of administration times equals 1440 divided by the
 frequency.
  
 2.  Schedule Edit Validation Two
 The system shall validate for frequencies greater than one day (1440
 minutes), that only one administration time is permitted. The system shall
 present a warning message to the user if more than one administration time
 is entered.
  
 3.  Schedule Edit Validation Three
 In Ward Administration Times field in the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS
 SCHEDULE EDIT] option, for a schedule that has a Schedule Type of
 Continuous, the system shall prevent a user from entering administration
 times to Odd Schedules, a schedule whose frequency is not evenly divisible
 by or into 1440 minutes (1 day).
  
 4.  Schedule Edit Validation Four
 Add validation to TYPE OF SCHEDULE field in Standard Schedule Edit [PSS
 SCHEDULE EDIT] option to remove frequency from the schedule file entry if
 the TYPE OF SCHEDULE is changed from CONTINUOUS to ONE TIME, ON CALL, or
 DAY OF WEEK. 
  
 5.  Schedule Edit Validation Five
 In the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option, the system shall
 prevent a user from creating Day of Week (DOW) schedules that are not in
 the correct day of week order.  The correct order is:
 SU-MO-TU-WE-TH-FR-SA.
  
 6.  Modify VistA Help Text
 The Help Text in Standard Schedule Edit was modified to add additional
 text so the user is able to see the added constraints when entering
 Administration Times.
  
 7. Remove Pro Re Nata (PRN), i.e., "as needed" from the list of
 selectable schedule types at the TYPE OF SCHEDULE prompt in the Standard
 Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option. In order to create a schedule 
 with a TYPE OF SCHEDULE of PRN, the last four characters of the schedule 
 name must be " PRN", i.e., a space followed by PRN.
 NOTE: It is recommended that sites check their ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE 
 (#51.1) file for schedules that contain PRN in the TYPE OF SCHEDULE (#5)
 field, but do not contain " PRN" (space PRN) at the end of the schedule 
 name. These schedules should either be renamed to conform to the PRN 
 naming convention (space PRN appended to the schedule name), or they 
 should no longer be used.

 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
 take less than 1 minute. 
  
 This patch works in conjunction with patch PSJ*5*113. The order in 
 which the patches are installed is not important, however, the 
 patches should be installed together as the changes in PSS*1*143 will not

        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
