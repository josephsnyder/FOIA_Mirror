 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000485092  Doesn't get PDX notification   bdj
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 If the user who is selected to be notified during a Patient Data Exchange 
 request has multiple entries in the NEW PERSON file (#200),  the code 
 is unable to determine which entry is correct and fails to add the 
 user as a recipient of the notification.    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update the code to store the entries as internal values, therefore 
 avoiding lookups for partial or duplicate matches.
  
 Routine: VAQREQ06
  
 2) INC000000146245  <UNDEFINED>SEGMNT+3^GMTS1
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 If a HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) entry is removed that is 
 referenced by the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT field (#.04) in the 
 VAQ - DATA SEGMENT file (#394.71) there is potential for an <UNDEFINED>
 error to occur if a site selects that segment for a Patient Data Exchange
 transaction.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Prior to extracting data specific to a HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file 
 (#142.1) entry, the code will validate the value to ensure the entry 
 exists and is valid.  In the event the value does not resolve to an entry 
 in the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1), nothing will be extracted 
 for that segment.
