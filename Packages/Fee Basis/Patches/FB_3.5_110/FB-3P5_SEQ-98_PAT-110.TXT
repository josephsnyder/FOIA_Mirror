  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  1) HD0000000299984 - Fee Basis calculator needs to be updated to account 
                       for MIPAA changes. 
  
  Problem:
  ========
  The Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act (MIPAA) of 2008
  modified the payment for specific Psychiatry CPT codes.  These codes are
  affected by a 5% increase in payment.  The CPT codes affected are 90804,
  90805, 90806, 90807, 90808, 90809, 90810, 90811, 90812, 90813, 90814, 
  90815, 90816, 90817, 90818, 90819, 90821, 90822, 90823, 90824, 90826,
  90827, 90828, 90829. This increase in payment is effective from July
  01, 2008 through December 31, 2009.
  
  Additional details for this update are available from the Centers for 
  Medicare and Medicaid Services in Change Request 6208.  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The routine FBAAFSR has been modified to increase payment for these 
  specific CPT codes.
  
  2) HD0000000286028 - RBRVS is producing the wrong fee for rate code 67113
  
  Problem:
  ========
  The wrong payment is being calculated for CPT 67113 in Calendar Year 2008. 
  
  Solution:
  =========
  Some of the Relative Value Units (RVUs) for CPT 67113 have changed 
  since the last Resource Based Relative Value Schedule (RBRVS) update and
  are now incorrect.  The current and updated RVUs are listed below:
  
  RVU                                Current Value       Updated Value   
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  WORK RELATIVE VALUE UNIT           22.49               25.00
  NON-FAC PRACTICE EXPENSE RVU       12.77               13.75
  FACILITY PRACTICE EXPENSE RVU      12.77               13.75
  
  3) HD0000000285257 - Activation of POV
  
  Problem:
  ========
  The following Purpose of Visit codes need to be updated in the FEE BASIS
  PURPOSE OF VISIT (#161.82) file.  
  
  NAME                                     FEE PROGRAM ASSOCIATED WITH
  ====================================================================
  Dialysis                                 OUTPATIENT
  Outpatient Maternity Care Services       OUTPATIENT
  Bowel and Bladder care: Agency           OUTPATIENT
  Bowel and Bladder care: Family caregiver OUTPATIENT
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The file will be updated with the requested changes.  Additionally, 
  the names will be converted to uppercase characters for consistency 
  with the other POV codes.  
  
  After this patch, the table above will be updated to:
  
  NAME                                     FEE PROGRAM ASSOCIATED WITH
  ====================================================================

  OUTPATIENT MATERNITY CARE SERVICES       OUTPATIENT
  BOWEL AND BLADDER CARE: AGENCY           OUTPATIENT

  after the installation of this patch.
