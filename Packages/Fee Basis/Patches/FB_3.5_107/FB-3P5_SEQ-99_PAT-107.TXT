Subject: PAYMENT CONFIRMATION ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch enhances the VistA Fee Basis software so it is able to receive
 and process both the current format and a planned new format of the
 payment confirmation message.  Central Fee (AITC) transmits the payment
 confirmation message to VistA.
  
 A future patch, FB*3.5*108, will increase the maximum size of the
 amount paid for Civil Hospital invoices.  Central Fee must switch to a new
 format of the payment confirmation message to accommodate an increase to
 the maximum size of the disbursed amount before patch FB*3.5*108 starts
 production testing.  Patch FB*3.5*107 prepares sites for the change to 
 the format.
