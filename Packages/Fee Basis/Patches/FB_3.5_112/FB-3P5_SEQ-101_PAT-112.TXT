  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  1) HD0000000355331 - Physician Fee Schedule has been revised for the 
                       October 2009 release. 
  
  Problem:
  ========
  There is a quarterly update (October 2009) available for the Resource Based 
  Relative Value Schedule.  
  
  More information is available at: 
  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/MM6617.pdf
  or
  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Transmittals/downloads/R1810CP.pdf
  
  Solution:
  =========
  This patch updates the data needed to calculate fee schedule amounts
  based on the RBRVS (also referred to as the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule)
  for calendar year 2009.  
  
  2) HD0000000360782 - Fee Basis Annual Update for CY2010
  
  Problem:
  ========
  The RBRVS schedule needs to be updated for the calendar year 2010.  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  This patch includes the data needed to calculate fee schedule amounts
  based on the RBRVS (also referred to as Medicare Physician Fee Schedule)
  for calendar year 2010.  The RBRVS fee schedule for future calendar years
  will be issued by a patch as they become available.
  
  The RBRVS fee schedule data is contained in four existing files. These
  files are all stored in global "^FB".  The four files are:
  
         FEE BASIS GEOGRAPHIC INDEX (#162.96) file
         FEE BASIS CPT RVU (#162.97) file
         FEE BASIS MODIFIER TABLE INDEX (#162.98) file
         FEE BASIS HCFA CONVERSION (#162.99) file
  
  The additional data added by this patch will increase the size of the
  FB global by approximately 5 MB.
  
  Installation of this patch will affect the menu options used to enter or
  edit payments for the Medical Fee program (outpatient) and ancillary
  payments for the Civil Hospital program.  The calendar year 2010 RBRVS
  fee schedule will be used for payments that have a date of service on or
  after January 1, 2010.  The RBRVS fee schedules for calendar years 
  beginning 1999 through 2009 will be retained in the computer and will
  continue to be used for payments that have a date of service on or after
  September 1, 1999 and before January 1, 2010.
  
  The computer would have used the 2002 RBRVS fee schedule for any payments
  entered prior to the installation of this patch that had a date of
  service on or before March 1, 2003.  Existing payments are NOT modified
  by this patch.  The fee schedule amount is only calculated when payments
  are entered or edited.
  
  The PLACE OF SERVICE (POS) code is used to determine if the facility or
  non-facility practice expense Relative Value Unit (RVU) should be used
  during RBRVS fee schedule calculations.  The list of codes considered
  facility and non-facility has not changed since 2007.  Here are the 2010
  valid POS codes that are in effect.
  
       Codes considered as facility setting -
       21,22,23,24,26,31,34,41,42,51,52,53,56,61
  
       Codes considered as non-facility setting -
       01,03,04,09,11,12,13,14,15,20,25,32,33,49,50,54,55,57,60,62,65,71,
       72,81,99
  
  
  The following five options are used to enter or edit payments for the
  Medical Fee (outpatient) program:
  
       Enter Payment                       [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
       Multiple Payment Entry              [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
       C&P/Multiple Patient Payment Entry  [FBAA C&P ENTER PAYMENT]
       Reimbursement Payment Entry         [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
       Edit Payment                        [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
  
  The following four options are used to enter or edit ancillary payments
  for the Civil Hospital program:
  
       Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment  [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
       Multiple Ancillary Payments          [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
       Patient Reimbursement for Ancillary  [FBCH ANCILLARY REIMBURSEMENT]
       Services
       Edit Ancillary Payment               [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
  
  The following option is used to calculate a fee schedule amount
  without having to enter a payment:
  
       Calculate Payment Amount             [FBAA FEE SCHEDULE RATE]
