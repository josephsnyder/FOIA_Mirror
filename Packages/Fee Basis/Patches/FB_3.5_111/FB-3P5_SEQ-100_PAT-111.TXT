 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1) HD0000000330388 - Quarterly Updates for RBRVS (Jan 09, Apr 09, Jul 09)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 There are three quarterly updates available for the Resource Based Relative 
 Value Schedule (RBRVS).  
  
 The details can be found in Change Requests (CR) CR6531, CR6397, and
 CR6484.
  
 CR6531 is available at:
 http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Transmittals/downloads/R1661CP.pdf
  
 CR6397 is available at:
 http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Transmittals/downloads/R1691CP.pdf
  
 CR6484 is available at:
 http://www.cms.hhs.gov/Transmittals/downloads/R1748CP.pdf
  
 Additionally, the Department of Labor has published Modifier data for 
 calendar year 2009.  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 This patch updates the data needed to calculate fee schedule amounts
 based on the RBRVS (also referred to as the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule)
 for calendar year 2009.  This patch also updates the Modifier Level data 
 obtained from the Department of Labor for the 2009 values.  
  
 The RBRVS fee schedule data is contained in four existing files. These
 files are all stored in global "^FB".  The four files are:
  
         FEE BASIS GEOGRAPHIC INDEX (#162.96) file
         FEE BASIS CPT RVU (#162.97) file
         FEE BASIS MODIFIER TABLE INDEX (#162.98) file
         FEE BASIS HCFA CONVERSION (#162.99) file
  
 This patch does not update the FEE BASIS HCFA CONVERSION (#162.99) file 
 or the FEE BASIS GEOGRAPHIC INDEX (#162.96) file.   
  
 The additional data added by this patch will increase the size of the 
 ^FB global by under 1 MB.  
  
 2) HD0000000304272 - Problem Adding Addtl Rates to a Contract
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When attempting to add additional rates to a contract, a user may not be 
 able to add a rate to a contract.  This is because a check is performed 
 to insure that the length of the new rate combined with all existing 
 rates is less than 510 characters.  This check was implemented to keep
 the function $$RATE^FBAAVD1 from returning a string that was over 512
 characters long.  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The check has been removed.  The function $$RATE^FBAAVD1 now returns 
 the  number of rates associated with a contract.  Additionally, if an 
 array is passed in as a parameter it will contain the rates associated 
 with the contract. 
  
 3) HD0000000308767 - Problem with HCPC 0159T
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When entering Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 0159T at an 
 option such as Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT] option, the Fee Basis
 software is incorrectly prompting the user for the anesthesia time.  CPT
 code 0159T is not associated with an anesthesia related procedure so this 
 in incorrect.
  
 This is caused by the function $$ANES^FBAAFS that identifies if CPT codes
 are anesthesia related.  The function is converting CPT code 0159T to 00159.  
 As CPT code 00159 falls under the range for anesthesia codes (00100-01999) 
 the software treats it as an anesthesia related code and requests a time.  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The function $$ANES^FBAAFS has been modified to identify the major category 
 of the CPT code rather than checking to see if the code falls within a range.  
  
  
 4) HD0000000316370 - The RBRVS rate for code 0073T is different from the 
                      Medicare rate. 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) rate for code 0073T is
 different from the Medicare rate. There are several CPT codes in the FEE
 BASIS CPT RVU (#162.97) file that have a CONVERSION CATEGORY (#.02) field
 of ANESTHESIA instead of MEDICINE.  This is causing the Fee Basis
 software to use the ANESTHESIA conversion factor, resulting in a lower
 calculated payment.  For example, in Current Year (CY)2009, the anesthesia
 conversion factor is 20.915 which is a much lower value than the medicine
 conversion factor of 36.0666.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The CONVERSION CATEGORY (#.02) field for these codes will be reclassified
 to MEDICINE.
  
 The following CPT codes are affected by this update:  
  
      0012F 0014F 0015F 0062T 0063T 0064T 0065T 0066T 0070T 0071T 
      0072T 0073T 0074T 0075T 0076T 0077T 0080T 0081T 0082T 0083T
      0084T 0085T 0086T 0087T 0090T 0091T 0092T 0093T 0094T 0100T
      0101T 0102T 0103T 0105T 0106T 0107T 0108T 0109T 0110T 0111T
      0115T 0116T 0117T 0120T 0123T 0124T 0126T 0130T 0133T 0135T
      0137T 0140T 0141T 0142T 0143T 0146T 0147T 0148T 0149T 0150T
      0151T 0160T 0161T 0162T 0163T 0164T 0165T 0166T 0167T 0170T
      0171T 0172T 0173T 0174T 0175T 0176T 0177T 0180T 0181T 0182T
      0183T 0184T 0185T 0190T 0191T 0192T 0195T
  
 Additionally, these CPT codes are also classified incorrectly in the CPT 
 (#81) file.  The LEXICON UTILITY patch, LEX*2.0*66 (Q409 updates) has
 corrected the CPT codes listed above.  
  
 5) HD0000000217639 - FBAA ENTER AUTHORIZTION
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Fee Basis software assumes a patient is ineligible if the discharge from the 
 last period of service is Dishonorable.  If more than one period of service 
 exists and one is honorable the patient is still being cast as ineligible.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The software will be modified so that it will not only check the Service 
 Discharge Type, as it does now, but it will also check to see if there is 
 an ineligible date.  If there is not an ineligible date, the patient will 
 be considered eligible and the message will not be printed to the screen.
  
 6) HD0000000237207 - Current Vendor information is pending Austin processing
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Users are getting a message " Current Vendor information is pending 
 Austin processing." but the vendor is not listed on the Medicare 
 Remittance Advice (MRA)'s Awaiting Austin Approval report.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 An unmatched set of parentheses in the routine, FBAAVD2, will be 
 corrected and another condition will be added to a $S command in
 CHK^FBAADV so that the "Current Vendor" message only prints when the
 vendor's information is actually pending AAC processing.
  
 7)  HD0000000064378 - MENU NOT WORKING  
  
 Problem:
 ========
 FEE ID card numbers beginning with alpha characters are not appearing
 on the Valid ID Card List Report.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 While attempting to run the Valid ID Cards List [FBAA ID CARDS CURRENT
 LIST] option, which is the Valid ID Card list report, it was noticed that
 there were patients missing from this list.  Upon review, all of the
 missing patients had at least one alpha character preceding the ID number 
 The software that looks for valid patients to list on the report was
 quitting whenever the patient's ID number was less than zero.  That 
 software will be modified by this patch to quit only if the patient's ID
 number is NULL.
  
  
 8)  HD0000000190740 - Remove SSN/Claim #  from Non-VA Authorization Form
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 After releasing Fee Basis patch, FB*3.5*101, which blocks the printing of 
 the first 5 digits of the patient's SSN, it was discovered that the claim 
 number on the 7078 Print report is sometimes the same as the SSN.  
 Therefore, it needs to be blocked here as well.  This report is obtained
 from the 7078 Print [FBCH PRINT 7078] option.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The routine that prints the 10-7078 reports has been modified so that if 
 the patient's claim number matches the SSN the claim number will be run 
 through the same functionality that blocks the printing of the SSN. (The 
 form is referred to as 10-7078 and the report is referred to as the 7078 
 Print.)
  
   
 9) HD0000000064355 - AMIS 349 OUT OF BALANCE
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The AMIS 349 Print [AMIS 349 PRINT  FBCNH AMIS] option reports are
 reporting Veterans as being discharged when, in fact, they have not been
 discharged.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The AMIS 349 report creates a list of patient Community Nursing Home 
 movements.  If a patient is discharged from one community nursing home
 and admitted the same day to another community nursing home and if the 
 original community nursing home has been deleted or found to be a 
 duplicate of the new community nursing home, the software is supposed to 
 check the "AH" and "AG" cross references of the FEE CNH ACTIVITY (#162.3)
 file and re-point them to the new vendor.  The existing software was
 only updating the "AH" cross reference which was causing the AMIS 349 
 reports to be out of balance.  This patch will change the software to 
 re-point the "AG" cross reference whenever the "AH" cross reference is 
 re-pointed.
  
 10).  Technical- correct several locking problems
  
 Problem:
 ========
 According the SAC standards, any global lock that is attempted must 
 be limited to a minimum of 3 seconds and, if unsuccessful, a message 
 should be printed to the screen, warning the user of the failed lock 
 attempt.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Each attempt to lock shall be limited to a number of seconds set by the value 
 of DILOCKTM.  If DILOCKTM is not available, the attempt will be limited 
 to three seconds.  Should a lock not be obtained, a message will be printed to 
 the screen, warning the user that someone else is editing the same record.  
 The user will either keep getting the message until the lock is cleared or the 
 user will be sent back to the original prompt which initiated the lock.
  
   
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 This patch may be installed during normal working hours with all users on
 the system. However, as it is necessary to disable some menu options
 when installing this patch, it is recommended that the install be done 
 during non-peak hours.  Additionally, installing during peak hours may
 lead to an unusually long install time.
