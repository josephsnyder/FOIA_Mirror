Description:
============

 Starting on May 23, 2008, Fee vendors are required to include the National
 Provider Identifier (NPI) of the referring practitioner when submitting
 electronic claims for payment.  The Chief Business Office (CBO) consulted
 with the Fee Service Office and determined that the most efficient way of
 providing this data to Fee providers is through the authorization process.
  
 With the introduction of this patch, Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) Fee will allow a user to record the 
 name and NPI of the referring VA practitioner during the authorization 
 process.  The information will then be available for the VA 10-7078 or 
 10-7079 Fee authorization forms.
  
 This patch adds the REFERRING PROVIDER and REFERERING PROVIDER NPI to VA 
 Fee Authorization Forms 10-7078 and 7079.  The REFERRING PROVIDER NPI is
 only printed if the AUTHORIZE RELEASE OF NPI flag is set to YES as
 determined by the new Kernel Application Program Interface (API)
 $$GETRLNPI^XUSNPI (IA#5070).
