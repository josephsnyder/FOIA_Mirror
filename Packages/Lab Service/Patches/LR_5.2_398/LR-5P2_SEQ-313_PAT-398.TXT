Subject: LRPHLIST FOR MIXED OPERATING SYSTEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Sites using mixed operating systems have encountered an error in option
 LRPHLIST [Itemized routine lab collection] due to the forced queuing of 
 the print job.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED NSR(S):
 ==================
 None 
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET:
 ========================
 HD0000000313266 - LRPHLIST option on Linux Application Server
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 East Colorado HCS
 Oklahoma City VAMC
 Puget Sound HCS
  
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000313266 - LRPHLIST option on Linux Application Server
                
 Problem:
 --------
 In the current mixed Operating System client/server architecture that 
 will soon become the standard in the Regional Data Center model, all print
 jobs must be queued through TaskMan.  Routine LRPHLIST, which prints
 collection labels, does not currently honor the "FORCED" queuing (field
 #5.5) required by the print device definition (file #3.5).
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routine LRPHLIST to allow collection label printing through
 TaskMan.  Sites not yet on the mixed operating system will not be 
 affected.
  
 Routine:  LRPHLIST
  
  
 BLOOD BANK IMPACT:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*398 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*398 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*398 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*398.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
