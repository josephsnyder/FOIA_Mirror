 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD222271 - Subscript errors
                
   Problem
   -------
   Routine LRWLST1 attempts to set data into file 68 (Accession file).
   Occasionally this routine is unable to get a lock and thus some data
   item(s) do not make it into file 68. This missing data then leads to
   <SUBSCRIPT> errors in LA7ADL.
  
   Solution
   --------
   Modify routine LRWLST1 to try repeatedly to get the lock.
  
   Routine:  LRWLST1

       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
