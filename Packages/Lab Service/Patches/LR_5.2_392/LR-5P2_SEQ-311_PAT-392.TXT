Subject: 'RANDOM' NOT PRINTING IN CPRS,ERROR PRINTING PATHOLOGY RPT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve 2 problems in the Lab Service package:
  
 1.  In CPRS GUI LABS tab, the designator "RANDOM" which is a response to
     the DRAW TIME prompt does not appear as do the responses "PEAK" and
     "TROUGH".
  
 2.  When running the Autopsy Anatomic Pathology report, an UNDEFINED 
     error can occur due to a variable which is not set properly.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 =========================
 1.  HD0000000317158 - "RANDOM" response to DRAW TIME prompt not appearing
 2.  HD0000000289588 - LRAPBK not printing last few autopsies

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1:  HD0000000317158  -  "RANDOM" response to DRAW TIME prompt not 
                         appearing.
                
  
     Problem:
     --------
     In CPRS GUI under the LABS tab, the designator "RANDOM", which is a
     valid response to the DRAW TIME prompt, does not print as do the other
     responses "PEAK" and "TROUGH".
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LR7OSMZ2 to display the designator "RANDOM" just as
     the designators "PEAK" and "TROUGH" are displayed.
  
     Routine:  LR7OSMZ2
  
  
 2:  HD289588 -  LRAPBK not printing last few autopsies
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Routine LRAPPF1 makes calls to other routines to handle printing of 
     Anatomic Pathology reports depending on which type of report is
     selected.  Before each call, the variable LRSF515 is set except for
     before the call to routine LRAPT2 for Autopsy reports, resulting in 
     an UNDEFINED error.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRAPPF1 to properly set the variable LRSF515 before 
     the call to routine LRAPT2.
  
     Routine:  LRAPPF1

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch may
 be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*392'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
