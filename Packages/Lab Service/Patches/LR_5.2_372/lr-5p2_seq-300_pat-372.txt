Associated patches: (v)LR*5.2*356  <<= must be installed BEFORE `LR*5.2*372'

Subject: Fixes Lab Package Report Issues

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch LR*5.2*356 made changes to the way the Reference Range and the
 Therapeutic Range are displayed with Laboratory results on the Labs tab 
 of CPRS GUI.  This patch will make further modifications to the way these
 ranges are displayed on the Lab tab and also update the CPRS Cover Sheet.
  
 LR*5.2*356 also made changes to these ranges on the Lab Test Description
 page which this patch will not change.
  
 This patch will not update the display of Reference or Therapeutic ranges
 for any of the Laboratory reports of the Reports tab because those reports
 are generated through a different package.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
   Problem: 
   --------
   Patch LR*5.2*356 made changes to the way the Reference Range and the
   Therapeutic Range are displayed with Laboratory results on the Lab tab 
   of CPRS GUI.  Some sites didn't like these updates and didn't like the 
   new line tags 'low:' and 'high:'.  Also, these changes were not made to 
   The CPRS Cover Sheet.
  
   This patch will make changes to the way these ranges are displayed on
   the Lab tab and also carry these changes over to the CPRS Cover Sheet.
  
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   This patch will make changes to the way these ranges are displayed on
   the Lab tab and also carry these changes over to the CPRS Cover Sheet.
  
   A new routine, LRLRRVF, was created to provide uniform formatting of the
   Laboratory test Reference range and Therapeutic range. 
  
   This patch will make updates to the following screens in CPRS GUI:
   - Cover Sheet tab, Recent Lab Results
   - Labs tab, Most Recent
               Cumulative
               All Tests By Date
               Selected Test By Date
   
  
   Note:
   -----
   This patch will not update any reports on the Reports tab. Those reports
   are generated by a different package.
  
  
   Reference Range & Therapeutic Range Formatting:
   -----------------------------------------------
   Working with subject matter experts, these were the formatting 
   guidelines agreed upon:
  
   1.  If neither low or high value is defined, nothing prints.
   
   2.  If the low only is defined and it is numeric, it prints: 
       Ref: >=low_value
  
   3.  If the low only is defined and it is equal to 0 or 0.0, it prints:
       Ref: >=0
  
   4.  If the low only is defined and it is alphanumeric (entered in 
       quotes), it prints:
       Ref: low_value
  
 * 5.  If the high only is defined and it is equal to 0, it prints: 
       Ref: 0
  
 * 6.  If the high only is defined and it is equal to 0.0, it prints: 
       Ref: <=0.0
  
   ** Sites will need to evaluate their tests which currently use 0 & 
      0.0 to be sure they get the desired display.
  
   7.  If the high only is defined and it is numeric it prints: 
       Ref: <=high_value
  
   8.  If the high only is defined and it is alphanumeric (entered in 
       quotes), it prints:
       Ref: high_value
  
   9.  If both low and high are defined it prints: 
       low_value - high_value
