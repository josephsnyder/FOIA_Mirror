Subject: ANTIBIOTIC LEVEL CONCENTRATION NOT WORKING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1.  When the EDIT CODE field (#98) of the LABORATORY TEST file (#60) 
     is set to 'ANTIBIOTIC LEVEL', and a user is entering results for a
     Laboratory Test, the system will not allow responses to the
     CONCENTRATION prompt that are acceptable according to help text.
  
 2.  The incorrect LAB TEST (field #1) and ACC NO. (field #8) are stored 
     in sub-file #64.1111 of the WKLD DATA file (#64.1) when the date of
     the order and the date of specimen collection are different.
  
 3.  There are 3 indicators for DRAW TIMES related to antibiotics: PEAK,
     TROUGH, and RANDOM.  The designator "RANDOM" will not appear on
     patient reports as does "PEAK" and "TROUGH".

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1:  HD0000000069526 - Unable to enter antibiotic concentration
                
     Problem:
     --------
     When the EDIT CODE field (#98) of the LABORATORY TEST file (#60)
     is set to 'ANTIBIOTIC LEVEL', and a user is entering results for a
     Laboratory Test, the system will not allow responses to the
     CONCENTRATION prompt that are acceptable according to help text.
  
     When the field EDIT CODE (field #98 of file #60) is set to'ANTIBIOTIC
     LEVEL', and a user is entering results for a Laboratory Test, the 
     system will not allow responses to the CONCENTRATION prompt,
     'CONC(ug/ml)', that are acceptable according to help text.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify the Data Dictionary input transform ^DD(63.42,2) for field
     CONC(ug/ml) to accept a range, specific values and also accept "<" 
     or ">" accompanied by a specific value.
  
  
 2:  HD0000000239034 - Accession information incorrect in WKLD DATA file
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The incorrect LAB TEST (field #1) and ACC NO. (field #8) are stored 
     in sub-file #64.1111 of the WKLD DATA file (#64.1) when the date of
     the order and the date of specimen collection are different.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRCAPPH to handle the 2 dates properly and extract the
     appropriate data items for inclusion in the building of the WKLD DATA 
     file.
  
     Routine:  LRCAPPH
  
  
 3:  HD0000000281918 - "RANDOM" designator will not appear on patient
                       reports
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When entering results for antibiotics, a DRAW TIME and a CONCENTRATION
     are requested. Possible responses to DRAW TIME are PEAK, TROUGH, and
     RANDOM.  The patient report (LRMIPSZ) prints the DRAW TIME alongside
     the appropriate CONCENTRATION.  The DRAW TIME designator RANDOM will
     not print on the report.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     The solution is to modify routine LRMIPSZ2 to print any DRAW TIME
     (including RANDOM) alongside the appropriate concentration.
  
     Routine: LRMIPSZ2
  
  
  
 Blood Bank Review:

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*388'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
