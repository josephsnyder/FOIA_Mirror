 ==========================================================================
  
 This patch will correct a formatting issue in the option LRSORC [Search 
 for critical value flagged tests].  It also resolves an issue in CPRS 
 Cumulative report on the LABS tab where differences are flagged because 
 of a leading or trailing zero.
  
  
 Associated Remedy Tickets:
 ==========================
 1. HD0000000239211 - Search for Criticals has format problem
  
 2. HD0000000232314 - Cumulative results in CPRS put ref ranges in some
                      test comments.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1:  HD0000000239211 - Search for Criticals has format problem
  
     Problem
     -------
     In the option LRSORC [Search for critical value flagged tests], the
     report has data items that run together (Accession and Date) when the
     accession area has 5 characters, making the report difficult to read.
  
     Solution
     ------------
     Modify routine LRSORC1A to output the report line in a more
     user-friendly manner.
  
     Routine:  LRSORC1A
  
  
 2:  HD0000000232314 - Cumulative results in CPRS put ref ranges in some
                       test comments.
  
     Problem
     -------
     In the Cumulative display under the LABS tab in CPRS, REFERENCE LOW 
     (field #60.01,1) and REFERENCE HIGH (field #60.01,2) of the LABORATORY
     TEST file (#60) are compared with the reference range fields of the
     "A" cross reference in the LAB REPORTS file (#64.5).  If there is a
     discrepancy between the values, a comment is added at the bottom of
     the display.  Currently, comments are generated when the only 
     difference is a leading or trailing 0.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Modify routine LR7OSUM1 to ignore leading or trailing 0s when making
     the comparison between the two values.
  
     Routine:  LR7OSUM1
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch may
 be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*384'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       press <ENTER>.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', press <ENTER>.
