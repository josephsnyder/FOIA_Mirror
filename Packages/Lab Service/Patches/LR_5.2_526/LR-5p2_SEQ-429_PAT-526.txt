Subject: SOCIAL WORK ICR 1528 RETIREMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 A Social Work package Integration Control Registration (ICR) is being
 retired.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1. INC6111013 - Lab Integration Control Registration Retirement - Social 
    Work
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Social Work ICR 1528 is being retired. This ICR returns a "homeless"
 indicator for a patient. The Laboratory package is a subscriber to this
 ICR and must replace it with another way to indicate whether a patient is
 homeless.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine LREPI3 has been modified to call routine DGUTL3 for retrieval of
 data from the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121) field of the PATIENT (#2)
 file. A value of "2" from this field indicates "HOMELESS". Supported ICR
 4080 allows for this data retrieval. No other Laboratory routines (both
 LA and LR prefixed) interact with Social Work package routines or files.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.  
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum matches
 the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
