Subject: Same SSN on entries in file 68

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  
 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 1. When printing a CAPTIONED template report in VA FileMan with the 
 printing of computed fields turned on for the ACCESSION file (#68), all of
 the values printed for the HOSPITAL ID computed field (#.09) are the
 same. It will print a different value for each different AREA (#.01) and
 use that value for all patients with accessions in that AREA (#.01)
  
  
 BLOOD BANK REVIEW:
 ==================
  
 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LR*5.2*436 contains changes to software 
 controlled by the ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA 
 Patches. Changes include: 
 File           Field      Field Name
 ====           =====      ==========
 68 (ACCESSION) .09        HOSPITAL ID - The DA variable has been removed. 
 This will require the use of the D0 variable when doing a lookup for the 
 CAPTIONED template.
  
 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*436 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*436 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to 0 routines and 
 1 files identified in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA 
 Patches, group B listing. The changes have no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality or medical device control functions. There is no adverse 
 potential to sites.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: 
 There are no validation requirements by option.
  
 MINIMAL TEST CASE SCENARIOS BY OPTION, INCLUSIVE OF ALL CONTROL FUNCTIONS:
 There are not test case scenarios by option.

 Problem:
 --------
 When printing a CAPTIONED template report in VA FileMan with the printing
 of computed fields turned on for the ACCESSION (#68) file, all of the 
 values printed for the HOSPITAL ID computed field (#.09) will be the same.
 It will print a different value for each different AREA (#.01) and use
 that value for all patients with accessions in that AREA (#.01)
  
 Technical Background:
 ---------------------
 The HOSPITAL ID computed field (#.09) in the ACCESSION file (#68) pulls 
 its value from the HOSPITAL ID computed field (#.09) in the LAB DATA 
 file (#63). The HOSPITAL ID computed field (#.09) in the LAB DATA file 
 (#63) pulls its value from the PATIENT file (#2) using the patient's LRDFN
 passed in either the DA or D0 variable. The logic in the computed field
 expects either DA or D0 to have a value, but not both. For some reason
 when running the CAPTIONED template with the option to print the computed
 fields both DA and D0 will be defined. The DA variable will contain the
 IEN of the current accession area being processed for the report. The D0
 variable will contain the LRDFN of the patient in the current accession
 record being processed for the report. 
  
 The HOSPITAL ID field (#.09) in the LAB DATA file (#63) will use the DA 
 variable to look up a patient and return that patient's HOSPITAL ID. It
 will return for all patient's in a given accession area the ID of the
 patient who's DFN matches the accession area's IEN. The patient who's ID
 is used may not even have an accession in that AREA. The patient could be
 an inpatient, an outpatient, or even deceased.
  
 The HOSPITAL ID field (#.09) in the LAB DATA file (#63) was last modified
 in 1984. At that time there may have been a reason to check for both DA
 and D0. That no longer appears to be the case.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Remove from the MUMPS code of the HOSPITAL ID field (#.09) using the
 variable DA to help pull the patient's ID from the PATIENT file (#2).
