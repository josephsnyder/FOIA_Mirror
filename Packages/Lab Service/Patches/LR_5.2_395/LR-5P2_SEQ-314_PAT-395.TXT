Subject: ADD TEST STATUS TO CPRS LAB REPORT API'S

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issues:
  
 1.  When reviewing Lab Results on the Labs Tab in CPRS, only verified lab
 results are shown.  Lab Specimens that have been collected, but not
 verified are not shown along with the results.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Three reports on the Labs Tab in CPRS have been modified to address this
 Issue.
 
 2.  A site reported that during a JCAHO Lab Survey, that the lab received
 a RIF because the lab test results do not have the date and time the labs
 were completed or reported on the Labs Tab in CPRS.  Reported instead are
 the date/time of collection.
 
 Solution:
 ---------
 The "Report Released Date/Time" was added to the three reports on the
 Labs Tab.
  
 The following reports will be affected by solutions 1 & 2:
    Most Recent
    All Tests by Date
    Selected Tests by Date
 
 These reports on the Labs Tab in CPRS will call a modified Lab API
 which will provide the status of a specimen that has been collected and in 
 process in the Lab. This patch modifies the Lab routines used in this API to
 accomplish the desired functionality.
 
 These corrections are implemented on the Labs Tab ONLY.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*395'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
