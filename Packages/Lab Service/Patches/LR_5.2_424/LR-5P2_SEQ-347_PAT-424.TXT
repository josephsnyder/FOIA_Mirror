 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC0000000365783
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a lab test specific to one facility is accessioned in a different 
    facility by mistake, the user receives a message stating that the test 
    "does not have an appropriate accession area".  But despite this, the 
    lab order is marked as collected and the order in CPRS is marked
    active.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed routines LRWLST and LROE2 so that the lab order will remain in 
    uncollected status, and the order in CPRS will remain pending.
  
 2. INC0000000069791
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the "Enter/verify data (auto instrument)" option [LRVR], at 
    the prompts "What tray:" and "What cup:", if the user enters a string 
    of numbers too long for the system to process it can cause a
    <SUBSCRIPT> error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed routine LRVR1 so that the error no longer occurs.
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    Error is <SUBSCRIPT>T2+4^LRVR1 caused by size of the variable LRTRCP.  
    Changed code so that LRTRCP must be 200 characters or less, in 
    accordance with the SACC.
  
 3. INC0000000486388
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When editing the field AUTOPSY ACC # in the file LAB DATA in FileMan, 
    an <UNDEFINED> error will result.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed the input transform of the field AUTOPSY ACC # so that the 
    error no longer occurs.
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    The error, <UNDEFINED>V^DIED *LRABV, occurs because the variable LRABV 
    is not set up in the context of FileMan.
    
 4. INC000000787142
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a lab order containing two or more panels is created, in which one
    atomic test is shared between multiple panels, the shared atomic test 
    will be missing a LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and 
    Codes) code when accessioned.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed routine LRVR1 so that LOINC codes are added normally for 
    repeated atomic tests.
