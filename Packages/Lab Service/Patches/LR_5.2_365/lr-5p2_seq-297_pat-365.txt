Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v27.  CPRS GUI
 version 27 consists of two host files:  OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID and
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID.  These two host files contain software
 patches that support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  The host files were created
 to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities.
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.27 and Associated Patches Installation Guide"
 for installation sequence information.  This document is exported as
 OR_30_243IG.doc and OR_30_243IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_243.ZIP.  
 
 Installation and set-up information specific to LR*5.2*365 is included
 in this patch description.
 
 OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID includes the CPRS and Pharmacy patches required for
 CPRS GUI v27.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 OR*3*243
 PSJ*5*134
 PSO*7*225
 
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID includes the related and required patches
 needed to support CPRS GUI v27 functionality.  It includes builds for the
 following patches:
 GMRA*4*38
 GMPL*2*35
 GMTS*2.7*80
 LR*5.2*365
 TIU*1*219
 WV*1*23
 
 Installation of the two CPRS host files should be coordinated among the
 packages affected since these host files will install the majority of the
 software needed to implement CPRS GUI v27.

 =========================== 
    
 VistA Laboratory Anatomic Pathology (AP) Alerts and Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS) Report Changes Patch LR*5.2*365 software 
 release addresses 7 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs). Individual reports 
 are displayed as one continuous scrolling display. A single row of 
 the equal (=) sign is used to separate one report from the next. 
 Additionally, the text "Next SURGICAL PATHOLOGY Specimen..." is 
 also used to separate reports. However, with multiple reports and 
 the use of single dashed lines in each report, it can be difficult 
 to distinguish the separation between AP reports. A new API has been 
 created (EN^LR7OSAP4) for retrieving a detailed report for an 
 individual Anatomic Pathology Specimen. This helps resolve the PSI 
 by allowing a package interface, like CPRS, to present each 
 accession and related specimens to the user and then display the 
 related report for the accession/specimens.
  
 Patches OR*3*210 and LR*5.2*311 implemented informational alerts 
 generated for AP pathology results. Recipients of VA view alerts for 
 Anatomic Pathology complained that clicking on the alert did not 
 open up or display the report to them in the same manner as other 
 lab alerts are displayed. Once the recipients click on the alert, it 
 is gone from view. If they did not make a note as to who the patient 
 was, they can not get the alert back. Providers can easily erase the 
 alerts without recording the patient's name. A potential malignancy 
 report could be missed. Problem was identified from complaints of 
 surgeons and oncologists/hematologists. To correct this issue the 
 new action alert is provided to display AP reports. The Anatomic 
 Pathology informational alerts are now modified into action alerts 
 that upon processing will direct the user to the associated report 
 in the Clinical Reports section under the Reports tab of the CPRS 
 GUI or to a List manager display of the associated report results. 
  
 This patch provides action alerts for Anatomic Pathology tests 
 including Electron Microscopy (EM), Surgical Pathology (SP), 
 Cytology (CY), and Autopsy (AU) results. These action alerts are 
 sent automatically to the Ordering Provider, Primary Physician, or 
 Primary Care Provider at the time the report is released. If 
 requested, alerts may be sent to additional person(s) and 
 mail group(s). These additional alerts are also action alerts. This 
 functionality is now the same whether electronic signature (ES) is 
 turned ON or OFF. Before this patch, additional alerts could not be 
 requested with electronic signature (ES) turned OFF.
  
 This patch provides the new Send an AP Alert [LRAP ALERT] option 
 that is available on the Verify/release menu, anat path [LRAPVR] 
 which allows a pathologist to send an action alert to a provider, 
 other individuals, or mail group(s) after the report has been 
 released. Before this software release if the user did not answer 
 YES to the prompt to send an alert after a report was released, an 
 alert could not be sent unless the AP report was reopened and 
 re-released.
  
 1) PSI-05-027 and PSI-07-135 identified a patient safety issue using the
 CPRS Graphic User Interface (GUI) Lab Tab, Laboratory Results- Anatomic
 Pathology (AP).  The individual reports are displayed as one continuous
 scrolling display.  A single row of equal (=) signs is used to separate
 one report from the next.  Additionally, the text- "Next SURGICAL
 PATHOLOGY Specimen..." is also used to separate reports.  However, with
 multiple reports and the use of single dashed lines in each report, it
 can be difficult to distinguish the separation between AP reports.
  
 Resolution:
 A new API has been created (EN^LR7OSAP4) for retrieving a detailed report 
 for an individual Anatomic Pathology Specimen.  This resolves the 
 PSI by allowing a package interface, like CPRS, to present each specimen 
 to the user and then get the report on the specimen.
  
 2) PSI-06-068, PSI-07-014, PSI-05-001, PSI-06-134, and PSI-07-031
 identified a patient safety issue with the Anatomic Pathology notification
 alerts. Patches OR*3*210 and LR*5.2*311 implemented informational alerts
 generated for pathology results.  Recipients of VA view alerts for 
 Anatomic Pathology have complained that clicking on the alert does not
 open up or display the report to them in the same manner as other lab
 alerts do (CH subscripted).  Once they click on the alert, it's gone from
 view.  If they didn't make a note as to who the patient was, they can't
 get it back.  It would be helpful to have an action alert for these
 results. Providers can easily erase them without recording the patient's
 name.  A potential malignancy report could be missed. Problem was
 identified from complaints of surgeons and oncologists/hematologists.
  
 Resolution:
 The Anatomic Pathology informational alerts are now modified into action
 alerts that upon processing will direct the user to the associated report
 in the Clinical Reports section under the Reports tab of the CPRS GUI or 
 to a List manager display of the associated report results.
  
 This patch provides action alerts for Anatomic Pathology reports including
 Electron Microscopy (EM), Surgical Pathology (SP), Cytology (CY), and 
 Autopsy (AU) reports.  These action alerts are sent automatically to the
 ordering provider and the primary care physician (PCP) at the time the
 report is released.  If requested, alerts may be sent to additional
 person(s).  These additional alerts are also action alerts.  This
 functionality is now the same whether electronic signature (ES) is 
 turned ON or OFF.  Before this patch, additional alerts could not be
 requested with electronic signature (ES) turned OFF.
  
 The Supplementary report release, anat path [LRAPRS] option now sends 
 action alerts automatically to the ordering provider and the PCP at the
 time the supplementary report is released.  If requested, alerts may be
 sent to additional person(s).  These additional alerts are also action
 alerts.  These alerts are sent whether electronic signature is turned ON
 or OFF.
  
  Modified options:
  ================
   NAME: LRAPR
   MENU TEXT: Verify/release reports, anat path
   TYPE: run routine
   LOCK: LRVERIFY
   DESCRIPTION:   This option is used to verify/release pathology reports.
  The user is prompted for the accession number of the report to be
  released.  If electronic signature is not activated, the user is asked if
  the report is to be released, yes or no. If electronic signature has been
  activated, the option is used to electronically sign and store pathology
  reports.  It also allows CPT coding to be performed regardless of the
  release status of the chosen report.  Another feature is the ability to
  print SNOMED codes for the given accession/report.  Action alerts are
  sent automatically to the ordering provider and the primary physician or
  PCP at the time the report is released. If requested, alerts may be sent
  to additional person(s) and/or mail group(s). These additional alerts are
  also action alerts.
   ROUTINE: LRAPR  
  
   NAME: LRAPRS
   MENU TEXT: Supplementary report release, anat path
   TYPE: run routine
   DESCRIPTION:   Releases supplementary reports for Surgical Pathology,
  Cytopathology, Electron Microscopy, or Autopsy.  If all supplementary 
  reports that exist for the chosen accession have already been released or
  if no supplementary reports exist for the accession, the user will be
  notified.  If electronic signature is not activated, the user is asked if
  the report is to be released, yes or no.  If electronic signature has
  been activated, the option is used to sign and store the supplementary
  report. Action alerts are sent automatically to the ordering provider and
  the primary physician or PCP at the time the supplementary reports are
  released.  If requested, alerts may be sent to additional person(s) and/or
  mail group(s).  These additional alerts are also action alerts.  These
  alerts are sent whether electronic signature is on or off.
   ROUTINE: EN^LRAPR
  
 3) This patch provides a new option, Send an AP Alert [LRAP ALERT] 
 available on the Verify/release menu, anat path [LRAPVR] menu which
 allows a pathologist to send an action alert to a provider or other
 person(s) or mail group(s) after the case has been released.  The use
 of this option requires the LRVERIFY key.  Before, if they did not answer
 YES to the prompt to send an alert after a report was released, an alert
 could not be sent unless the case was reopened and re-released.
  
  
  New Option:
