 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000768005 - Immediate Collect not recognized as COLLECTION TYPE
                      TO EXCLUDE. 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Immediate Collect orders can be designated as a COLLECTION TYPE TO EXCLUDE
 in the Howdy Site File (#69.86) but these orders are not excluded from
 Howdy processing. The LABORATORY ORDERS file (#69) stores an "I" to
 represent an Immediate Collect order but the Howdy Site file (#69.86)
 stores an "IC". The mismatch from these 2 files leads to Howdy not
 recognizing these orders as COLLECTION TYPES TO EXCLUDE.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify the DD (Data Dictionary) for the field COLLECTION TYPE (TO EXCLUDE)
 (field .01 of subfile #8) of the Howdy Site File (#69.86) to store an "I"
 when Immediate Collect is selected to be a COLLECTION TYPE (TO EXCLUDE)
 rather than an "IC".  Post- install routine LR430PST will correct this
 value in the Howdy Site File (#69.86) if the incorrect value is there.
  
 DD:   ^DD(69.868,.01)        Routine:    LR430PST
  
 2. INC000000777275 - flaw in code for HOWDY Specimen times by UID
    
 Problem:
 --------
 In Track Collection option [LRHY TRACK COLLECTION], the report prints the
 same time for both TIME SPECIMEN COLLECTED and TIME LABELS PRINTED. This
 is because the labels are automatically printed at the time of collection.
 The data for TIME LABELS PRINTED is redundant and not meaningful in the
 context of patient care and should be removed from the report.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routine LRHYBC1 to remove this data item from the report.
     
 Routine: LRHYBC1
  
 3. INC000000823106 - Howdy: Incorrect user DUZ captured on report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The DUZ (Designated User) for an employee is the IEN (Internal Entry
 Number) for the employee in the New Person file (#200) and identifies the
 employee in the application. Option LRHY PATIENT WAIT TIME report
 sometimes prints the DUZ for the wrong lab tech for some patients on the
 report. This can happen if orders for 2 different days are processed
 through the Howdy software by different techs on the same day and the
 orders have the same specimen number in the Lab Orders file (#69).
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routine LRHY4X to sort the orders by order date_"^"_specimen
 number_"^"_UID (unique identification) rather than merely by specimen
 number.
  
 Routine: LRHY4X
  
 4. INC000000845102 - Howdy: Wait Time report spacing
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the Patient Wait Time report option [LRHY PATIENT WAIT TIME], the lab
 tech DUZ and the accession number run together on the
 detail line if the lab tech DUZ is longer than 6 characters.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routine LRHY4X to print a line feed after the lab tech DUZ if the
 DUZ is longer than 6 characters so that the items following the lab tech
 DUZ appear on the next line.
  
 Routine: LRHY4X
