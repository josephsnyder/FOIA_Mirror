Associated patches: (v)LR*5.2*350  <<= must be installed BEFORE `LR*5.2*416'

Subject: ADDRESS SOME AP REPORTING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 3 issues in the Lab package.
  
 1. The Review By Order Number [LRCENLKUP] option gives misleading
    information when 1 of the samples of a multi-sample order is not
    collected.
  
 2. The LRAPFICH [Print final path reports by accession number] option
    prints the incorrect year on the SNOMED CODE LISTING which, is printed
    at the end of the anatomic pathology report for some AP accessions.
  
 3. Character string in "MODIFIED" banner of autopsy reports prevents
    report from getting to TIU.
  
 BLOOD BANK REVIEW:
 ================== 
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*416 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*416 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC0000000535477 - Order problem
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When one of the samples of a multi-sample order is not collected, the
    REVIEW BY ORDER NUMBER [LRCENLKUP] option still indicates that the
    sample has been collected and accessioned.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRCE so that the message "Order has already been
    accessioned" is not printed under this sample when the sample has not
    been collected.  Routine also modified to not print out the text
    "Tests have been accessioned, call the lab to add tests to the same
    order" under the sample when it has not been collected.
  
    Routine:    LRCE  
  
 2. INC0000000591233 - ACC year displaying as 2011 on CPT code report
    DUPLICATE(S):
    INC0000000592442 - Wrong year on AP final report page 2 for a few
                             AP accn numbers
    INC0000000872016 - Wrong accession number on SNOMED CODE LISTING
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a specimen is logged in to Anatomic Pathology at the beginning of
    one year but the specimen is collected for a date at the end of the 
    previous year, the SNOMED CODE LISTING page displays the wrong
    accession number.  The last 2 digits of the year make up part of the
    accession number, and the code uses the specimen collection date to
    construct the accession number. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRSPRPT to use the DATE/TIME SPECIMEN RECEIVED field
    (#.1) of the SURGICAL PATHOLOGY subfile (#63.08) of the LAB DATA file
    (#63) to construct the accession number, which is printed on the
    SNOMED CODE LISTING portion of the AP report.
  
    Routine:  LRSPRPT  
  
 3. INC0000000733708 - Autopsy reports not viewable in CPRS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There is a BLANK CHARACTER STRING (field #1.06) defined in the TIU
    PARAMETERS FILE (file #8925.99).  This is a 3 character string that
    is usually populated with "***".  The autopsy reports, when verified
    and released, will not be stored in TIU, as they should be, when the 
    report contains this BLANK CHARACTER STRING.  The "MODIFIED" banner
    that prints on a modified autopsy report contains this BLANK CHARACTER
    STRING and the report is not filed in TIU and is thus not visible in
    CPRS.
  
    Option DISPLAY SURG PATH REPORTS FOR A PATIENT [LRAPSPCUM] also prints
    "***" in the "MODIFIED" banner.  While this report does not go to TIU, 
    the "MODIFIED" banner has been changed to "*+*" for consistency.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routines LRAPBR4 and LRSPRPTM to replace the character string
    "***" with the character string "*+*" in conformity with the other
    reports coming out of the Anatomic Pathology software.
  
    Routine:    LRAPBR4  LRSPRPTM
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
    can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
    option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
    select the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
      that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
 5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
  
    Options:
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
  
    If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
    patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
    Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
    your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
    'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
 6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
    and select the package 'LR*5.2*416.
  
    If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    choose 'NO'.
  
    If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
