Subject: ADDRESS PROBLEM OF GHOST TESTS AND WRONG URGENCY IN FILE 68

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1. Incomplete test definition leads to "ghost" tests showing up in
    Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
 2. Panel tests sometimes get wrong urgency stored in the ACCESSION
    file (#68) when ordered with an atomic test with a higher
    urgency than the panel test.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000726683 - Ghost tests showing up in CPRS.
    
    Duplicates:
    -----------
    INC000000070299
    INC000000733129
    INC000000740714
    INC000000784997
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user is entering a new entry in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60)
    and either times out or fails to value the required fields, FileMan 
    automatically deletes this entry. However, because of 
    cross-references on select fields used to keep OERR file ORDERABLE
    ITEMS (#101.43) in sync with supporting packages, the entry in the 
    ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) is created and not updated. This causes
    the entry in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) to be selectable in
    CPRS and referencing an entry in Lab that does not exist.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    When an entry in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60) is deleted by FileMan
    the entry in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) should be inactivated.
    This is accomplished with modifications to routine LR7OV0.
  
    Routine: LR7OV0  
  
 2. INC000000847438 - Wrong test urgency included in Turnaround Time Report
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an accession is created with a panel test of ROUTINE urgency and
    also an atomic test of a higher urgency (STAT) and the accession gets
    resulted, the panel tests get defined in the ACCESSION file (#68) with
    WKLD (workload) urgency of STAT.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRCAPV1S to correctly inherit the WKLD urgency of the
    panel test.
  
  
    Routine: LRCAPV1S   
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
    can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the Kernel Installation & Distribution System
      (KIDS) patch onto your system.
  
   2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
      select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
      that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
  
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
      If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
      patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
      Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
      your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
      'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
      and select the package LR*5.2*434.
  
      If prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//",
      answer NO.
  
      If prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//", answer NO.
