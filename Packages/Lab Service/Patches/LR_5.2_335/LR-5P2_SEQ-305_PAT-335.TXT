Subject: VISTA TO VBECS DATA CONVERSION

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 LR*5.2*335 is being exported as part of the VBECS package release. The 
 installation of this patch will be controlled by a phase release. An 
 Implementation Manager will be assigned to your site and will contact 
 your POC for VBECS and will provide your site with the location of the 
 KIDS Host Files prior to your scheduled installation date installation 
 Sequence.
  
 Select elements of VistA data must be transferred to the VBECS Blood Bank 
 system prior to its initial operation. This will preserve patient related 
 clinically and historically relevant information. This patch will install 
 the software necessary to prepare the data for extraction from the VistA 
 database, and extract the data to text files for transfer to the VBECS 
 system. Some of the VistA data will be standardized to nationally 
 recognized Blood Bank definitions during the extraction. Logical checks 
 in the software will ensure data integrity. Once the data on the VistA 
 side have been evaluated and converted to the new database, specific 
 VistA Blood Bank options will be deactivated (placed out of order) so 
 that the legacy database cannot be altered. These options are listed 
 below under "The following options are placed out of order." More details 
 can be found in the "Blood Bank Pre-Implementation Data Validation, 
 Mapping, and Conversion ADPAC Guide" document. The inadvertent or 
 unintentional deactivation of these options could cause a disruption in 
 Blood Bank operations. 
  
 Please read and follow the instructions in the "Blood Bank 
 Pre-Implementation Data Validation, Mapping, and Conversion Installation 
 and User Guide" before proceeding with the installation.

 RISK ANALYSIS: The changes made by patch LR*5.2*335 affect Blood Bank 
 software functionality, however the RISK is considered to be low.
   Inappropriate use of the "Disable VistA Blood Bank components"
   [VBEC BB COMPONENTS DISABLE] option can disable the VistA 5.2
   Blood Bank system.  This risk is minimal since the "Enable VistA
   Blood Bank components" [VBEC BB COMPONENTS ENABLE] option can be
   used to restore full operations.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*335 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to 0 routines and 
 4 files identified in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive 
 2004-058, group B listing. The changes have no effect on medical device 
 control functions.
   This is the final step prior to the transfer of Blood Bank operations
   to the VBECS system. All future impact will be dealt with through VBECS
   development
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:
   No VistA Blood Bank 5.2 options are released with this patch.
   However, the options listed above should be tested to ensure that
   they have been disabled after the completion of the data conversion.

 controlled phased release.  Follow the sequence listed below when your 
 phased installation occurs.
  
   1. LR*5.2*335
   2. LR*5.2*367

 COMPONENT SUMMARY:
 ==================
 This patch installs ROUTINES, FILES, OPTIONS and a MAIL GROUP. For full 
 details about the components being imported with this patch, please see 
 the Blood Bank Pre-Implementation Data Validation, Mapping, and 
 Conversion Technical Manual
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Although this is a controlled, phased released, the user & technical 
 documentation will be available to all sites when the patch is officially 
 released and the phased implementations start. This will allow sites the 
 opportunity to retrieve the documents before their phased installation 
 date
  
 Documentation is available for the VBECS package on the 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of 
 Information (OI) Field Offices. Sites will be able to utilize
 Documentation in either the ".PDF" or "DOC" format after they extract the
 ZIP file.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
 Download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 NOTE:  The ZIP file listed below will be listed in each of the 
 VBECS and LR patches that are part of the VBECS package and associate 
 patches, it only needs to be downloaded once.

 The following files are contained in the VBECS_1_4_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file 
 and will not be individually located on the OI Field Office Anonymous 
 Directories.
  
 The VBECS_1_4_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file will need to be extracted on your

   Installation Information:
   ==========================
  
 This patch is exported as part of the VBECS Blood Bank System and allows 
 the conversion of limited existing Blood Bank data from VistA to VBECS. 
 Please refer to the "Blood Bank Pre-Implementation Data Validation, 
 Mapping, and Conversion Installation and User Guide" for installation 
 information. The files listed below may be obtained via FTP. The 
 installation of VBECS and its related patches are being handled as a 
 controlled release. The implementation manager will contact you with the 
 location of the KIDS Host Files prior to your scheduled installation 
 date. The documentation files will be available for download in advance 
 of installation through the anonymous download site as shown below.
  
   Installation Files: 
   ===================
 The following files are exported for LR*5.2*335:
    LR_52_335.KID
  
    VBECSBATCH.COM
  
 LR_52_335.KID and VBECSBATCH.COM files will be made available by the 
 Implementation Manager prior to your site's implementation schedule along 
 with instruction to retrieve.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
     1) Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS Installation
        menu. The Host File name is LR_52_335.KID. Answer YES to the
        question: "Want to Continue with Load? YES//"
     2) From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu,
        select the Installation menu.
     3) From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*335).
        a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
