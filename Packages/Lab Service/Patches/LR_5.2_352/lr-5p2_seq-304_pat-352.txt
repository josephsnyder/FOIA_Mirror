   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   
   The Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) project is being undertaken to support
   technology and business changes that are occurring with the implementation
   of the HEC Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) project.  Some modified and new
   business functionality is being included in the new system and corresponding
   changes are necessary in VistA for preliminary determination of veterans
   Enrollment and Eligibility status. The EVC project has been rolled out in
   three phases.  This release represents the third and last phase or EVC
   Release 2.
   
   Host file DG_53_P688.KID is comprised of the Registration patch DG*5.3*688,
   Enrollment Application System patch EAS*1.0*70, Income Verification patch 
   IVM*2*115.  Other software being released as EMERGENCY priority supporting
   patches are the Scheduling patch SD*5.3*441, Radiology/Nuclear Medicine 
   patch RA*5.0*70, Surgery patch SR*3.0*159 and Laboratory Service patch
   LR*5.2*352.
   
   
 Features of this patch are as follows:
 =======================================
   LR*5.2*352 simply extends the capability made available in the LAB CIDC
   patch, LR*5.2*291, to accommodate the SHIPBOARD HAZARD AND DEFENSE (SHAD)
   indicator for veterans to which it applies.
    
   Minor modifications have been made to five routines in the LRBE namespace.
   These modifications allow LAB to receive, store, and send to other
   applications (e.g., OERR and PCE) the SHAD environmental indicator. 
   
   A storage location for the value assigned to the SHAD indicator has been
   created in the ICD-9 CODES sub-file (#69.05) of the LAB ORDER ENTRY file
   (#69).  The name of the new field is SHIPBOARD HAZARD AND DEFENSE (#9).
   
   The name of the ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS indicator has been changed to
   SOUTHWEST ASIA CONDITIONS (SWAC).  Therefore the name and description of 
   field #5 within the ICD-9 CODES sub-file (#69.05) is being modified
   accordingly.
