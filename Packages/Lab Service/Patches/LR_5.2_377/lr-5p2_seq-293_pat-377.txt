Description:
============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*377 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.

 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*377 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
 **************************************************************************
  
 This patch is a follow-up to patch LR*5.2*289 which was released on 
 7/23/2003 and introduced the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)
 Delta Check.
  
 This patch will add a new Delta Check containing an updated formula 
 used to calculate the eGFR with a constant of 175 instead of 186 in the
 previous formula. 
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET(S):
 ============================
 HD145899 - Concern about the eGFR delta check
  
 Duplicates:
 -----------
 HD152150 - LR*5.2*289 Edit eGFR formula 
 HD217266 - DAY - eGFR 
 HD218640 - Need to make eGFR change in calculation because of 
            Creatinine standardization. 
 HD221531 - status of LR*372 for EGFR changes
 HD222321 - wrong calculation for eGFR
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Bay Pines VAMC
 Dayton VAMC
 New Jersey HCS
 Hudson Valley HCS
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Some site are starting to use a new methodology for the formula used to
   calculate the eGFR when using the new ultra sensitive Creatinine.
   
   
   Solution:
   ---------
   A new routine (LREGFR2) will be used for this purpose to calculate the 
   eGFR with the new constant of 175.  The old routine (LREGFR) will still
   be available to those sites still using the old methodology (constant of
   186).
  
   A new Delta Check will need to be created (or an existing one edited) to
   call the new routine.  See Post-Installation Instructions for more
   information.
   
   The Creatinine record in the LABORATORY TEST file (file #60) will need 
   to be edited to use this new Delta Check.  Sites will need to change 
   TYPE OF DELTA CHECK (field # 7) in the multivalued field SITE/SPECIMEN 
   (field #100).  
  
   Keep in mind that any existing delta checks for eGFR will not be deleted
   or altered by the installation of LR*5.2*377.  See Post-Installation 
   Instructions for more information.

      MAIN]:
  
             Edits and Distribution ...
             Utilities ...
             Installation ...
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option:
      Installation
  
             1      Load a Distribution
             2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
             3      Print Transport Global
             4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
             5      Backup a Transport Global
             6      Install Package(s)
                    Restart Install of Package(s)
                    Unload a Distribution
  
  3.  From this menu, it is highly recommended that you use the following
      options (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*377):
  
      a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will verify 
          the checksums of routines included in this patch.

 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
 If/when the sites want to use the new eGFR methodology (LREGFR2), they 
 will need to create a new delta check (or edit an existing one) and edit
 the Creatinine record in the LABORARTORY TEST file (file #60). Sites will
 need to update TYPE OF DELTA CHECK (field #7) in the multivalued field
 SITE/SPECIMEN (field #100) to point to the new (or newly edited) Delta
 Check.
  
 **NOTE:  Sites which use mutilple versions of the eGFR Delta Check will 
 need to create new (or edit existing) versions for each eGFR Delta Check.
  
  
 Example of the new delta check:
 -------------------------------
 NAME: EGFR2                             XECUTABLE CODE: D
