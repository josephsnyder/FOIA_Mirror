 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
 HD201697 - Rollover NULL subscript error
  
   Problem
   -------
   When "in common" accession areas are used in conjunction with tests
   that are set up to have unique accession numbers, sometimes a partial
   entry is set in the ACCESSION file (#68) for the "in common" area.  
   This partial entry then leads to a null subscript error when rollover
   runs.
  
   Solution
   --------
   Modify LRWLST11 to complete the partial entry so that rollover can
   take place without incident.

 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.

       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*375'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
