 This patch corrects a problem where Labserver reports are held up because 
 the subject line in the MailMan message is too long (greater than 65 
 characters).
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET:

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
   HD202854 -  Labserver reports not returned to requestor.
  
   Problem
   -------
   Labserver reports are reports that are created at sites in response to
   MailMan messages from a central location.  These reports are then sent
   to the requesting/central location (via MailMan) for collating/
   accumulation/analysis.  The subject line in these reports includes the
   site name as defined in the Institution file (file #4).  If the site
   name is long, the subject line exceeds the 65 character limit and the
   reports are never sent to the requesting central location.
  
  
   Solution
   --------
   Modify routine LRSRVR6 to limit the subject line of the returned
   MailMan message to 65 characters.
  
   Routine:  LRSRVR6

 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your

   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that

         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
