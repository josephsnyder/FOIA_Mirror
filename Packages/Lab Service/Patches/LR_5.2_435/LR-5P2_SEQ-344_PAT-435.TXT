 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
  
 1. INC000000900926     -  New VHIC cards do not work
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The VHIC 4.0 card removes the Social Security Number and replaces it
    with a VHIC card number as a means of identifying patients. Howdy
    software does not recognize the VHIC card number and therefore is
    unable to identify the patients.  The generic lookup routine for the
    lab package, LRDPA, also does not identify a patient using a VHIC card
    number that has less than 9 numeric characters.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify Howdy routines LRHY0, LRHY01, LRHYAFT, and lab generic lookup
    routine LRDPA to be able to identify a patient based on the swipe or
    bar code from the VHIC 4.0 card.
  
    Routine LRHY0  LRHY01  LRHYAFT  LRDPA  
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can
    be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your

    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*435.
