 Installation Sequence
  
 Installation Sequence 
 ======================
 The files listed below represent the patches will be part of the 
 controlled phased release.  Follow the sequence listed below when your 
 phased installation occurs.
  
   1. LR*5.2*335
   2. LR*5.2*367
   3. VBECS Bundle (consisting of VBEC*1*0 and LR*5.2*325)
   4. VBEC*1.0*1
   5. OR*3.0*212 
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Although this is a controlled, phased released, the user & technical 
 documentation will be available to all sites when the patch is officially 
 released and the phased implementations start.  This will allow sites the 
 opportunity to retrieve the documents before their phased installation 
 date
  
  
 Documentation is available for the VBECS package on the 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of 
 Information (OI) Field Offices. Sites will be able to utilize
 Documentation in either the ".PDF" or "DOC" format after they extract the
 ZIP file.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
 Download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
 specific server as follows:
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 NOTE:  The ZIP file listed below will be listed in each of the 
 VBECS and LR patches that are part of the VBECS package and associate 
 patches, it only needs to be downloaded once.

 Installation Files: 
 ===================
  
 LR_52_367.KID
  
  
 The host file LR_52_367 will be made available by the Implementation 
 Manager prior to your site's implementation schedule along with 
 instruction to retrieve.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 The installation of VBECS and its related patches are being handled as a 
 controlled release. The implementation manager will contact you with the 
 location of the KIDS Host Files prior to your scheduled installation date.
  
     1) Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS Installation
        menu. The Host File name is LR_52_367.KID .  Answer YES to the
        question: "Want to Continue with Load? YES//"
     2) From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu,
        select the Installation menu.
  
     3) From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*367).
        a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
        d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
     4) Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
        LR*5.2*367.
     5) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        YES//', respond NO.
     6) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
