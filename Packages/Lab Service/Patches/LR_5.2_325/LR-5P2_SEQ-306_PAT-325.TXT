 Although this is a controlled, phased released, the user & technical 
 documentation will be available to all sites when the patch is officially 
 released and the phased implementations start.  This will allow sites the 
 opportunity to retrieve the documents before their phased installation 
 date
  
  
 Documentation is available for the VBECS package on the 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of 
 Information (OI) Field Offices. Sites will be able to utilize
 Documentation in either the ".PDF" or "DOC" format after they extract the
 ZIP file.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
 Download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
 specific server as follows:
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
