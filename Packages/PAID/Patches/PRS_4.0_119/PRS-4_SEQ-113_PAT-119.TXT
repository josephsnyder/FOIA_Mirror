 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1.   HD0000000123832     Saturday Premium Pay
  
      Problem:
      --------
      Saturday premium pay is being reduced when a holiday is included
      on the same day, resulting in employees being underpaid.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Modified PRS8WE2 to correct Saturday Premium Pay hours if holiday 
      pay is also included on that day.
  
  
 2.   HD0000000173486     Holiday pay not correct
  
       Problem:
       --------
       Part Time employee pay is incorrect when 2 holidays fall together in
       the same period, resulting in employees being overpaid.
  
       Resolution:
       -----------
       Modified PRS8HRSV to reflect correct holiday pay hours for part-time
       employees if 2 holidays fall together in a pay period.
  
  
 3.    HD0000000274860    Holiday Pay Issue
  
       Problem:
       --------
       Part time and nurse holiday pay is incorrect if it falls during a
       two day tour. Employee is only being paid for the amount of time
       worked on the actual holiday itself instead of the amount of the
       entire tour, resulting in underpayment.
  
       Resolution:
       -----------
       Modified PRS8HRSV to credit part time and nurse employees for
       the full amount of holiday pay earned.
