Description:
============

 This patch includes the following:
  
  1. Updates to decomposition processing for credit hours earned.
  2. A new option which displays employee tour hours.
  3. Fixes for defects in the Employee Overtime/Comptime/CredHrs/CompTrav
     [PRSRSU-OT/CT] and [PRSRFI-OT/CT].
  4. Fixes for several defects in the timecard decomposition processing.
  5. Updates to options Enter/Edit Employee Tour of Duty [PRSA TK
     TOUR-EDIT] and Posting/Tour Change [PRSA TP POST] options to prevent
     tours with overlaps. These updates address HD248208.

     36/40 alternate work schedule and the Normal/Tour hrs unequal 
     exception to address HD260298.
  
  
 **Special Note:
  
 Originally, patch PRS*4.0*117, along with patch PRS*4.0*116, was
 intended to update the Enhanced Time & Attendance (ETA) software to
 support new functionality for Compensatory Time for Travel, Nurse
 Executive Special Pay, Extension of Regular Compensatory Time to 26 pay
 periods, and the separation of Compensatory Time from Credit Hours. 
 However, that work is placed on indefinite hold, and patch PRS*4.0*120 is
 reserved to update the aforementioned functionality, should that work be
 reactivated. This patch is no longer the second of two patches which will
 implement the aforementioned functionality as stated in patch PRS*4.0*116.

 The enhancements made by this patch are summarized below:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
 Updated Timecard Decomposition Functionality for Credit Hours
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 The following options to decompose a timecard are updated to support 
 credit hours:
  
    Pay Period Certification [PRSA SUP REV]
    Decompose Time [PRSA PAY DECOMP]
    T&L Decomposition Report [PRSA T&L DECOMP REPORT]
  
 The decomposition software is updated to evaluate any credit hours (earned
 or used) that is posted on the timecard. The decomposition has been
 applying the same business rules to both comp time and credit hours,
 however, since credit hours earned is not eligible for any premiums and
 does not count towards hours worked in the day greater than 8 or hours
 worked in the week over 40, new logic is needed in the decomposition to 
 apply the correct business rules to credit hours posted on the timecard.
  
 The decomposition software is updated to enforce the following business 
 rules:
  
 1. Credit hours used receives the same premium pay as regular comp time used.
 2. Credit hours used is counted as hours worked in the day and in hours
    worked in the week for all employees including code C and code R
    firefighters. 
 3. Credit hours used is counted as hours worked in the 2806 calendar year
    adjustment value.
 4. An employee with an hourly tour that is entitled to earn night 
    differential can normally earn it while on paid leave. However, if the 
    employee is not a wage grade employee and the total amount of leave 
    taken during the pay period is 8 hours or more, no night differential is 
    granted for most types of leave. The following types of paid leave are 
    counted to determine if the total during the pay period is 8 hours or 
    more and in that case would forfeit any night differential earned for 
    this time:
  
         Annual Leave
         Restored Annual Leave
         Sick Leave
         Family Care & Bereavement
         Adoption
         Donor Leave
         Comp Time/Credit Hrs Used
  
    The software continues to include credit hours in this count of leave 
    and treat any night differential granted for the credit hours used in the 
    same manner.
 5. Credit hours earned will not receive any premium pay such as night 
    differential or weekend premiums.
 6. Credit hours earned is not entitled to a 2 hour minimum.
 7. If a period of call-back overtime is entitled to a 2 hour minimum and
    that overtime is adjacent to a period of CREDIT HRS Earned, the CREDIT
    HRS Earned shall reduce the two hour minimum of call- back overtime. 
 8. Credit hours earned is not required to be time eligible for overtime
    (>8/day or >40/week). 
 9. Credit hours earned is not counted as hours worked in the day or week
    when determining if overtime thresholds have been reached. 
 10. Credit hours earned is not included in the 2806 calendar year
     adjustment value. 
 11. If a count of the days worked is to be reported on the 8B string,
     a day posted with only credit hours is not included in this count.
 12. Credit hours earned is not to be considered part of a period of work for
     sleep time calculations. The software constructs these periods to
     identify the twenty-four hour periods of work. 
  
  
 New Option--Display Employee Tour Hours
 ---------------------------------------
 A new report has been added to sub-menus on the Timekeeper, T&A 
 Supervisor and Payroll menus. From the Timekeeper menu the option is 
 located on the Employee Data sub-menu. From the T&A Supervisor and the 
 Payroll main menus, the report is located on the Employee Reports 
 sub-menu.
  
   Menu Text                    Name                       Menu
   ---------------------------  -------------------------  ----------
   Display Employee Tour Hours  [PRSRFI EMP TOUR HR DISP]  Payroll
   Display Employee Tour Hours  [PRSRSU EMP TOUR HR DISP]  Supervisor
   Display Employee Tour Hours  [PRSRTK EMP TOUR HR DISP]  Timekeeper
  
 The option allows timekeepers, supervisors and payroll to view 
 employee's tour of duty number, tour of duty hours, tour hours on each 
 day and 8B normal hours for a selected pay period within the T&L units 
 assigned to them. The Tour Hours column contains a total of any tour 
 hours that fall on that day, so, two day tours will contribute hours to 
 both days on which they fall.
  
  
 Bug Fixes
 ---------
  
 Can't Change Secondary Tour During Prior Pay Period Adjustments
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 While updating the software to prevent overlapping tours the development
 team realized that users have no way to access the second tour of duty 
 if they are doing a prior pay period adjustment to edit the tour of duty.
 The option Posting/Tour Change [PRSA TP POST] is updated to allow 
 timekeepers to add, edit or delete a secondary tour of duty.
  
 Wrong Tour of Duty Displayed in Option Posting/Tour Change
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 When making a prior pay period adjustment with the option Posting/Tour
 Change a timekeeper may edit the tour of duty and repost the day. The
 posting screen is showing the original tour of duty, instead of the new
 tour of duty just entered by the timekeeper. This bug, which was
 identified during development of the patch, is corrected, so that the
 current tour of duty is displayed. 
  
  
 Night Differential Over Reported with Prior Pay Period Leave
 ------------------------------------------------------------ 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Employees, with the exception of wage grade employees, are not entitled to
 receive night differential for periods of leave when they have used eight
 hours or more of leave in the pay period. 
  
 An existing fault was discovered during testing of patch PRS*4.0*116 with
 the way that leave posted on the last day of the prior pay period which
 crosses midnight (into the current pay period) is treated. The software
 maintains a total of leave taken during the pay period in order to determine
 whether periods of leave are eligible for night differential. However,
 leave that crosses into the pay period is not being included in the
 total. This leave should be included. 
  
 All types of leave are also totaled separately and are being counted
 correctly. However, when the amount of leave being applied to the current
 pay period that originates from the last day of the prior pay period will
 increase the total leave taken in the current pay period from less than eight
 to eight or more hours, then night differential is being over reported. This
 is due to the fact that the software treats any leave posted to the pay
 period as eligible for night differential when the total leave is less 
 than eight hours.
  
 Sample Timecards (last pp and current) that produces too much night diff
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
  Note:  Prior pay period timecard display with the last day posted with
         leave. The period of leave from Midnight to 8:00am is applied to
         the next pay period. The total leave applied to the next pay 
         period is 7.5 hours ( mid-8a less meal time)

 Decomp Result from Current Pay Period
 -------------------------------------
   Note:  Night differential in week 1 is being reported as 40 hours. The
          amount of night differential should have been reduced by the 
          amount of leave in the pay period (7.5 hours from prior pp
          and 8 hours from current pp). So, the correct night differential
          for week 1 should be 24.5.
             (40 hrs night diff. - 15.5 hrs leave = 24.5 hrs night diff).

 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PRS8AC is modified to count prior pay period leave that 
 crosses into the current pay period in order to determine whether 
 the greater than eight hour threshold has been reached that removes 
 entitlement to night differential while on leave.
  
  
 Employee Overtime and CompTime/Credit Hours Report
 [PRSRSU-OT/CT] and PRSRFI-OT/CT] 
 --------------------------------------------------
 While updating the option, Employee Overtime and CompTime/Credit Hours
 Report [PRSRSU-OT/CT] and PRSRFI-OT/CT], an existing bug was corrected and
 included with this patch. The report was not showing pay period totals for
 gross salary when the user selected more than one pay period for the
 report, but was instead displaying a cumulative total of all pay periods
 that had been processed by the report. This is corrected by the patch; it
 now shows pay period totals and at the end of the report the total gross
 salary for all pay periods included in the report is displayed with the
 other totals. 
  
   
 Full-time Employee Not Appropriately Credited for Overtime
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Full time employees that are not on a compressed tour and have fewer
 than 40 scheduled hours in one of the weeks are not getting credit for
 OA/OE type overtime that is worked in that week. 
  
 This problem was discovered during field testing of patch PRS*4*116.
 Patch PRS*4*117 will modify ETA to give appropriate credit for the
 overtime. 
  
  
 Inappropriate Overtime Credited for Tour Hours In Excess of 8/day
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 ETA may inappropriately count normal tour time as overtime (DA/DE
 type) when the following conditions are all true. 
  
   a. The tour of duty is not marked as compressed.
   b. More than 8 tour hours occur on the day (i.e. MID-MID period).
   c. The total amount of tour time for the week is 40 or fewer hours.
  
 If these conditions are all met, the scheduled tour hours in excess of 8
 per day are inappropriately credited as the DA/DE type of overtime. This
 problem was discovered during unit testing of patch PRS*4*117. The patch
 modifies ETA to stop crediting overtime for normal scheduled tour hours.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Compensatory Time Off for Travel (#20050308)
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1.  HD238214 OT/CT Report showing zeroes for one T&L 
 2.  HD260298 Endless loop when running PRSA TPE PPE 
 3.  HD248208 Tour Overlap Not Prevented by Software
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1.  HD238214 OT/CT Report showing zeroes for one T&L 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The option Employee Overtime and CompTime/CreditHours Report
 [PRSRSU-OT/CT] and [PRSRFI-OT/CT] shows no hours used for any timeframe
 entered, for the VCS T&L unit, even though employees in that T&L unit
 are known to have OT/CT hours that should be reported. 
  
 The code that gathers the overtime and comp time data is gathering the 
 data for VCS T&L units, however, the code that displays the data for 
 employees in the VCS T&L unit quits and shows zeros because the T&L unit 
 does not start with a number.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Software code in routine PRSROT11 was updated to display data gathered for
 VCS T&L unit. 
  
  
 2.  HD260298 Endless loop when running PRSA TPE PPE 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An endless loop is possible, when running the option List Prior Pay
 Period Exceptions from any of the following entry points: 
  
   -List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA TPE PPE]
   -List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA PAY PPE]
   -List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA SUP PPE]
  
 A new pay period exception (Normal/Tour hrs unequal) was added by patch
 PRS*4.0*116. It is not normally possible for that exception to be filed 
 during pay period certification, because it is a fatal exception. Fatal 
 exceptions prevent timecards from being certified and exceptions aren't 
 filed until the timecard is certified. However, the List Prior Pay Period
 Exceptions options, listed above, will rerun exception checks for prior
 pay periods and will file new exceptions if they are found. So, for pay
 periods prior to the installation of patch PRS*4.0*116, if a site had
 prior pay period exceptions on file in the 458.5 file and also during that
 pay period, the timecard had tour hours that did not match the employee's
 8B Normal hours, then the new exception (Normal/Tour Hrs Mismatch) would
 be filed.
  
 For the endless loop to occur, a site would have to have two of the 
 Normal/Tour hrs unequal exceptions, in different pay periods, for a single 
 employee. If this scenario is met, then any of the List Prior Pay Period 
 Exceptions options will incorrectly compare the filed exception while 
 checking the pay period again to determine if the exception was 
 corrected. The option, then deletes the filed exception and adds the 
 same exception to the end of the file. The option continues to remove 
 and add the same exceptions until the process is aborted. End users can 
 not typically abort the process without intervention from IRM.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update routine PRSATPE, which returns pay period exceptions, so that any 
 exceptions returned by that routine, match the format of exceptions 
 expected by the List Prior Pay Period options.
  
 Note:  Routine PRSATPE is also modified to update the format of the
 four exceptions for nurses working the 36/40 alternate work schedule,
 since these exceptions have the potential of causing the same problem. 
 The new exceptions are as follows: 
  
      36/40 AWS nurse has a 2 day tour on Saturday
      36/40 AWS nurse has tour carryover from prior pp
      36/40 AWS nurse must have 3 12 hr tours in week 1
      36/40 AWS nurse must have 3 12 hr tours in week 2 
  
 In addition, the code in routine PRSASR that displays these and all
 other exception messages in the Pay Period Certification [PRSA SUP REV]
 option, has been updated. In that option these messages are labeled
 "Tour Errors" and are presented in reverse video. The option is updated
 so longer messages will not wrap to the beginning of the next line, but
 instead are always right justified and use a new line in the display if
 they are longer than the available space on the current line. 
  
  
 3.  HD248208 Tour Overlap Not Prevented by Software
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The options Enter/Edit Employee Tour of Duty [PRSA TK TOUR-EDIT] and
 Posting/Tour Change [PRSA TP POST] do not prevent entry of overlapping
 tours of duty. The options have provided warnings in the past, but
 timekeepers have been able to ignore the warnings and create tours that
 overlap. It is never appropriate to create a tour that has overlap, as in
 the following example: 
  
       Date          Scheduled Tour    
     --------------------------------
         ...
         ...
    Thu 27-Mar-08     Day Off
    Fri 28-Mar-08     08:00P-08:00A
    Sat 29-Mar-08     MID-08:00A       
  
 In the above example, the two day tour beginning on Friday overlaps with 
 the tour that starts at Midnight on Sat.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 The option Enter/Edit Employee Tour of Duty [PRSA TK TOUR-EDIT] is 
 updated with new logic which will prevent the user from saving a tour of 
 duty if there are any days that have overlapping tours. When checking 
 for overlaps, the option will also look at the prior pay period to 
 determine if any hours from that pay period overlap with the first day 
 of the pay period being edited. Also, the next pay period will be 
 checked to determine if any tour hours from the current pay period being 
 edited overlap with tour hours on the first day of the next pay period.  
 In all cases, when overlapping tours are found, the software will 
 prevent the user from saving the tour of duty.
  
 The following are examples of the new messages users will see when being 
 prevented from saving tours with overlaps.
  
 1.  ERROR: Current-PP 08-14, Day 7 Primary overlaps Day 6 Primary
 2.  ERROR: Xmitted-PP 08-12, Day 10 Primary overlaps Day 11 Primary
  
 The updates provided to prevent tour overlap WILL NOT prevent tours 
 with existing overlaps. If there are tours with existing overlaps and they
 are not edited, then they will persist in the ETA system.
