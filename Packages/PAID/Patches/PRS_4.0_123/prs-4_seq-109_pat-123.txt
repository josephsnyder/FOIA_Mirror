Subject: INAUGURATION DAY HOLIDAY 2009

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the software to recognize Tuesday, January 20, 2009 
 as a holiday for sites that have a majority of their employees working in
 the Washington DC area. This patch should be installed at all sites, but
 the Presidential Inauguration Day holiday will only be set at specific
 sites. The Presidential Inauguration Day holiday is not entitled to an in
 lieu of day.
  
  
 The modifications made by this patch are described in more detail below:
  
 1. Enhance how non-recurring holidays for the Washington D.C. area are
    handled:
  
    This patch modifies the way in which the PAID package handles extra
    holidays that are declared and affect only the Washington D.C. area.
    These holidays are not entitled to in lieu of days and this patch 
    modifies the software to suspend the processing of in lieu of days in
    the event that one of these special holidays is declared.
  
  
 2. Establish 1/20/09 as a holiday for DC area sites:
  
    Due to Office of Personnel regulations, all federal employees employed
    in the District of Columbia, Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in
    Maryland; Arlington and Fairfax Counties in Virginia; and the cities of
    Alexandria and Falls Church in Virginia will be given a federal holiday
    for the Presidential Inauguration Day. Office of Personnel regulations 
    reference indicates that Tuesday, January 20, 2009 is to be treated as
    a holiday for pay entitlement purposes. However, no in lieu of day shall
    be set for this holiday.
  
    This patch updates the PAID package so the following VistA systems will
    recognize Tuesday, January 20, 2009 as a holiday.
  
    Station   VistA System
    Number
    -------   ----------------------------
    101       VA Central Office
    688       Washington VA Medical Center
  
  
    Other VistA systems will not automatically recognize this day as a
    holiday for all employees. However, the Set Holiday Benefit Day [PRSA
    TK EMP-HOL] option can be used by payroll to specify a holiday for
    selected employees. Sites that have some (but not a majority) of
    employees working in the DC area will need to use this option to set
    January 20, 2009 as a holiday for applicable employees.
