Subject: DECEMBER 26, 2008 HOLIDAY

Description:
============

 On 12/12/2008, President Bush signed an executive order that excuses
 executive branch employees from duty on the Friday after Christmas Day,
 (12/26/2008), except where agency officials decide they must remain open
 because of national security, defense, or other public reasons.
  
 When the President signs an executive order declaring a non-holiday day
 as an official holiday, a patch must be released that will modify the
 software to identify this non-holiday day as a holiday. It is preferable
 to install this patch prior to the opening of the pay period which contains
 the newly declared holiday.  If PP 08-26 has been opened prior to the
 installation of this patch, this patch will also loop through PP 08-26
 to set the extra holiday as needed.
  
 This declared holiday falls within pay period 08-26 which runs from
 12/21/2008 through 01/03/2009.
  
 Payroll usually opens pay periods on the Thursday immediately preceding
 the first day of the pay period. For pay period 08-26 this would be
 Thursday 12/18/2008. However, the VistA PAID/ETA software will allow the
 opening of pay periods up to 7 days prior to the first day of the pay
 period.
  
 Patch PRS*4*122 adds December 26, 2008 as a holiday to the Enhanced Time
 and Attendance module of PAID 4.0 (ETA) software. The primary effect of
 adding the holiday to ETA is to correctly update employee timecards when
 pay period 08-26 is opened. Once the patch is installed, December 26,
 2008 will be treated as all other holidays in ETA.
