Category:

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one issue: the Uniform allowance hourly rate is
 different in the Central PAID system than in the VistA system.
  
 Note: After the 30 day compliance date for this patch Central PAID will 
 send an Edit & Update download to re-populate the Uniform Allowance 
 Hourly Rate.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:

 1. HD55311  Clothing allowance not transferring
     duplicate - HD137859  Field 565 of file 450 - value loses 1/10 amount.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. HD55311  Clothing allowance not transferring
  
       Problem:
       -------
       Site POC reports they change the clothing allowance hourly
       rate in the PAID system but it is not showing the change 
       in VistA. Also found that the display of the Clothing 
       Allowance field (#565) in the Employee Inquiry reports
       is incorrect.
       
       Resolution:
       ----------
       This is only a problem when this field is edited - not when
       it is entered initially.  Corrected the Edit and Update 
       record 3 layout routine to not truncate the field to 4 characters.
       Corrected the display of the Uniform Allowance Rate (#565)
       field in the Employee Inquiry reports.
