Subject: Code Set Versioning API Fix/Modifier AJ

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

   This Patch fixes a problem with an existing CPT Code Set API and updates
   the CPT Modifier file to reflect a recent change in the status of a CPT 
   Code/Modifier pair.
  
   1)  The CPT Modifier AJ, Clinical Social Worker, was not selectable for
       use with CPT Codes 90806 and 90808. The CPT Code/Modifier pairs
       AJ/90806 and AJ/90808 were inactivated in 2005.  This patch 
       re-activates these pairs, allowing AJ to be used with both 90806
       and 90808.
   
   2)  A problem was discovered in the entry point CODM^ICPTCOD.  The problem
       occurs when one software package uses CODM^ICPTCOD to retrieve/select a
       CPT modifier and another software package uses MODP^ICPTMOD to verify
       the selected modifier.  These two entry points produced conflicting
       results.  The user was able to select the CPT modifier in one scenario
       only to have it rejected later.  This left the user with the impression
       that their input had "disappeared."
   
       The entry point CODM^ICPTCOD has been modified to produce the exact same
       results as MODP^ICPTMOD.  After installation of this patch, users will
       be presented with a list of only those CPT Modifiers that have been
       verified as appropriate for the CPT code.  When the user's input is 
       passed from one application to another, it will be verified and saved.
