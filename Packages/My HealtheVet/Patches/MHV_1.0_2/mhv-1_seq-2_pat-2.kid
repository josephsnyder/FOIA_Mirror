Summary
"BLD",7310,1,4,0)
-------
"BLD",7310,1,5,0)
MHV*1*2 delivers infrastructure changes in support of upcoming Personal 
"BLD",7310,1,6,0)
Health Record (PHR) HL7 interfaces. It also consolidates features common 
"BLD",7310,1,7,0)
to message receivers and builders, and encapsulates interaction with the 
"BLD",7310,1,8,0)
HL7 v1.6 package to ease transition to HLO based interfaces should that 
"BLD",7310,1,9,0)
become necessary.  Most routines were modified to take advantage of the 
"BLD",7310,1,10,0)
logging features released with MHV*1*1.

Detailed Description
"BLD",7310,1,14,0)
--------------------
"BLD",7310,1,15,0)
MHV*1*2 releases a number of infrastructure changes to improve interface 
"BLD",7310,1,16,0)
development and support.  Processing common to many interfaces such as 
"BLD",7310,1,17,0)
validating patient identifiers, and common segment builders has been 
"BLD",7310,1,18,0)
consolidated into centralized functions.  Use of HL7 package APIs and 
"BLD",7310,1,19,0)
variables has been moved from individual interfaces and encapsulated in 
"BLD",7310,1,20,0)
centralized functions.  If a move from HL7 v1.6 to the new HLO engine 
"BLD",7310,1,21,0)
becomes necessary, the impact will be minimized.  All interfaces and 
"BLD",7310,1,22,0)
extractors have been updated to use the logging utility introduced with 
"BLD",7310,1,23,0)
MHV*1*1.  The message transmitter now provides support for extractors 
"BLD",7310,1,24,0)
that need to use a local array to hold extracted data.  
"BLD",7310,1,25,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,26,0)
The MHV Rx refill interfaces introduced with MHV 1.0 use original mode 
"BLD",7310,1,27,0)
acknowledgements, a synchronous call into VistA, and do not require a 
"BLD",7310,1,28,0)
logical link to respond to the MHV system.  The MHV HL7 interface 
"BLD",7310,1,29,0)
framework also supports enhanced mode acknowledgments, an asynchronous 
"BLD",7310,1,30,0)
call into VistA.  The PHR HL7 interfaces will use enhanced mode 
"BLD",7310,1,31,0)
acknowledgements, and require a logical link to define the connection to 
"BLD",7310,1,32,0)
the MHV system.  The new link is MHVVA and is distributed with this 
"BLD",7310,1,33,0)
patch.  This link references a new domain, MHV.MED.VA.GOV, but does not 
"BLD",7310,1,34,0)
require this domain to be entered in the DOMAIN file (#4.2).
"BLD",7310,1,35,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,36,0)
Event driver and subscriber protocols for the RTB^K13 query response 
"BLD",7310,1,37,0)
message and the ORP^O10 order response message are being released to 
"BLD",7310,1,38,0)
support a future change in Rx refill messaging from original mode 
"BLD",7310,1,39,0)
acknowledgements to enhanced mode acknowledgements.
"BLD",7310,1,40,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,41,0)
MHV*1*2 updates the MHV REQUEST TYPE file #2275.3 with entries to support 
"BLD",7310,1,42,0)
the new PHR interfaces.  These entries are disabled by having the BLOCKED 
"BLD",7310,1,43,0)
field #.03 set to YES.  A new field, ROUTINE BUILDER field #.06, holds 
"BLD",7310,1,44,0)
the name of the query specific builder routine used by RTB^K13 types.  A 
"BLD",7310,1,45,0)
new field DESCRIPTION field #2 provides a brief description of the 
"BLD",7310,1,46,0)
interface supported by that request type.
"BLD",7310,1,47,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,48,0)
The MHV RESPONSE MAP file #2275.4 is new with this release.  It is used 
"BLD",7310,1,49,0)
to map inbound messages to the protocol and routine used to create the 
"BLD",7310,1,50,0)
response message, and the segment used to break messages on a whole 
"BLD",7310,1,51,0)
record boundary.
"BLD",7310,1,52,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,53,0)
PHR HL7 interfaces have the potential to carry very large messages.  
"BLD",7310,1,54,0)
MHV*1*2 introduces the ability to break those messages into multiple 
"BLD",7310,1,55,0)
smaller messages for a "bolus" style response.
"BLD",7310,1,56,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,57,0)
MHV*1*2 fixes a bug where the TX field formatter did not correctly 
"BLD",7310,1,58,0)
calculate the size of the data put in the field, and thus could not 
"BLD",7310,1,59,0)
enforce field size constraints.  This issue was not encountered in 
"BLD",7310,1,60,0)
production because existing interfaces do not require such constraints.  
"BLD",7310,1,61,0)
The TX field formatter was rewritten to use an improved algorithm and fix 
"BLD",7310,1,62,0)
this bug.
"BLD",7310,1,63,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,64,0)
MHV*1*2 also fixes a bug where an incorrect ACK code and segment 
"BLD",7310,1,65,0)
descriptor could be returned on negative acknowledgments triggered by the 
"BLD",7310,1,66,0)
request manager.  This issue was not encountered in production because 
"BLD",7310,1,67,0)
the conditions required to trigger it have not occurred.  These are 
"BLD",7310,1,68,0)
improper interface configuration, and catastrophic data integrity errors.
"BLD",7310,1,69,0)
 
"BLD",7310,1,70,0)
The pre-init routine PRE^MHV1P2 turns on MHV Application Logging.  It 
"BLD",7310,1,71,0)
will log information about MHV HL7 messages received during the patch 
"BLD",7310,1,72,0)
install.  This is only a precaution as the MHV application is tolerant of 
"BLD",7310,1,73,0)
messaging failures that might be caused by loading the patch.  If a 
"BLD",7310,1,74,0)
message was received during the patch installation, you will be notified 
"BLD",7310,1,75,0)
and asked to check the error trap for errors in the MHV namespace.  If 
"BLD",7310,1,76,0)
any are found, you should log a remedy ticket.
"BLD",7310,1,77,0)
The post init routine POST^MHV1P2 will update the MHVVA logical link and 
"BLD",7310,1,78,0)
turn off MHV Application Logging.  For test systems, it will remove data 
"BLD",7310,1,79,0)
from the DNS DOMAIN (#.08), TCP/IP ADDRESS (#400.01), and TCP/IP PORT 
"BLD",7310,1,80,0)
(#400.02) fields and set AUTOSTART (#4.5) to Disabled.  For production 
"BLD",7310,1,81,0)
systems, it will ensure the correct values are in the DNS DOMAIN (#.08), 
"BLD",7310,1,82,0)
TCP/IP ADDRESS (#400.01), and TCP/IP PORT (#400.02) fields and set 
"BLD",7310,1,83,0)
AUTOSTART (#4.5) to Enabled.

Summary
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
-------
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
MHV*1*2 delivers infrastructure changes in support of upcoming Personal 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
Health Record (PHR) HL7 interfaces. It also consolidates features common 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
to message receivers and builders, and encapsulates interaction with the 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
HL7 v1.6 package to ease transition to HLO based interfaces should that 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
become necessary.  Most routines were modified to take advantage of the 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
logging features released with MHV*1*1.

Detailed Description
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
--------------------
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
MHV*1*2 releases a number of infrastructure changes to improve interface 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
development and support.  Processing common to many interfaces such as 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
validating patient identifiers, and common segment builders has been 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
consolidated into centralized functions.  Use of HL7 package APIs and 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
variables has been moved from individual interfaces and encapsulated in 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
centralized functions.  If a move from HL7 v1.6 to the new HLO engine 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
becomes necessary, the impact will be minimized.  All interfaces and 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
extractors have been updated to use the logging utility introduced with 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
MHV*1*1.  The message transmitter now provides support for extractors 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
that need to use a local array to hold extracted data.  
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
The MHV Rx refill interfaces introduced with MHV 1.0 use original mode 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
acknowledgements, a synchronous call into VistA, and do not require a 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
logical link to respond to the MHV system.  The MHV HL7 interface 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
framework also supports enhanced mode acknowledgments, an asynchronous 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
call into VistA.  The PHR HL7 interfaces will use enhanced mode 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
acknowledgements, and require a logical link to define the connection to 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
the MHV system.  The new link is MHVVA and is distributed with this 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
patch.  This link references a new domain, MHV.MED.VA.GOV, but does not 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
require this domain to be entered in the DOMAIN file (#4.2).

Event driver and subscriber protocols for the RTB^K13 query response 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
message and the ORP^O10 order response message are being released to 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
support a future change in Rx refill messaging from original mode 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
acknowledgements to enhanced mode acknowledgements.
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)

MHV*1*2 updates the MHV REQUEST TYPE file #2275.3 with entries to support 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
the new PHR interfaces.  These entries are disabled by having the BLOCKED 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
field #.03 set to YES.  A new field, ROUTINE BUILDER field #.06, holds 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
the name of the query specific builder routine used by RTB^K13 types.  A 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
new field DESCRIPTION field #2 provides a brief description of the 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
interface supported by that request type.
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,47,0)
 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,48,0)
The MHV RESPONSE MAP file #2275.4 is new with this release.  It is used 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,49,0)
to map inbound messages to the protocol and routine used to create the 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)
response message, and the segment used to break messages on a whole 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,51,0)
record boundary.
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,52,0)
 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,53,0)
PHR HL7 interfaces have the potential to carry very large messages.  
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,54,0)
MHV*1*2 introduces the ability to break those messages into multiple 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,55,0)
smaller messages for a "bolus" style response.
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,56,0)
 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,57,0)
MHV*1*2 fixes a bug where the TX field formatter did not correctly 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,58,0)
calculate the size of the data put in the field, and thus could not 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,59,0)
enforce field size constraints.  This issue was not encountered in 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)
production because existing interfaces do not require such constraints.  
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,61,0)
The TX field formatter was rewritten to use an improved algorithm and fix 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,62,0)
this bug.
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,63,0)
 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,64,0)
MHV*1*2 also fixes a bug where an incorrect ACK code and segment 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,65,0)
descriptor could be returned on negative acknowledgments triggered by the 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,66,0)
request manager.  This issue was not encountered in production because 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,67,0)
the conditions required to trigger it have not occurred.  These are 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,68,0)
improper interface configuration, and catastrophic data integrity errors.
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,69,0)

The pre-init routine PRE^MHV1P2 turns on MHV Application Logging.  It 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,71,0)
will log information about MHV HL7 messages received during the patch 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,72,0)
install.  This is only a precaution as the MHV application is tolerant of 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,73,0)
messaging failures that might be caused by loading the patch.  If a 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,74,0)
message was received during the patch installation, you will be notified 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,75,0)
and asked to check the error trap for errors in the MHV namespace.  If 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,76,0)
any are found, you should log a remedy ticket.
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,77,0)
The post init routine POST^MHV1P2 will update the MHVVA logical link and 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,78,0)
turn off MHV Application Logging.  For test systems, it will remove data 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,79,0)
from the DNS DOMAIN (#.08), TCP/IP ADDRESS (#400.01), and TCP/IP PORT 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,80,0)
(#400.02) fields and set AUTOSTART (#4.5) to Disabled.  For production 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,81,0)
systems, it will ensure the correct values are in the DNS DOMAIN (#.08), 
"PKG",634,22,1,"PAH",1,1,82,0)
TCP/IP ADDRESS (#400.01), and TCP/IP PORT (#400.02) fields and set

A request is typically a query for a data domain, but can be just about 
"^DIC",2275.3,2275.3,"%D",3,0)
any operation that can be requested via HL7 and requires some code to be 
"^DIC",2275.3,2275.3,"%D",4,0)
executed within the MHV package.  The file defines much of the behavior
