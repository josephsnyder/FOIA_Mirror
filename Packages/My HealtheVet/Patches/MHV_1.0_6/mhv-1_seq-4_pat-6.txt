 MHV*1*6 Secure Messaging
  
 Summary
 -------
 MHV*1*6 delivers the HL7 interfaces needed to support Secure Messaging.
 There are nine new queries in the MHV namespace that support the
 administration and daily operation of the Secure Messaging enterprise
 system. MHV*1*6 installs the components necessary to execute the admin
 queries to retrieve information on patients, providers, clinics, and
 teams.
  
  
 Detailed Description
 --------------------
 Secure Messaging allows patients and clinicians to email each other
 securely and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those
 email threads to the medical record as progress notes.
  
 Relationships between patients and clinicians are established based on
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) providers, clinic appointments and
 Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) teams.  Secure Messaging uses
 triage groups based on these relationships to manage which patients are
 able to email which providers.  More information on secure messaging can
 be found on the MyHealtheVet (MHV) product web site (intranet)
 http://vaww1.va.gov/MyHealtheVet/, and MHV web site www.myhealth.va.gov.
  
 This patch allows the secure messaging server to communicate with VistA.  
 After the software is released, Secure Messaging must be implemented from
 the business aspect.  This will be done in stages, making it some time
 before all medical centers are using it.  Each site has designated a point
 of contact to represent the site on MHV national calls.  More information
 on the rollout is available through the site point of contact.  The MHVVA
 logical link was distributed in MHV*1*2, and is already enabled and set
 for autostart.  Traffic on the MHVVA logical link will not begin until
 your site starts using Secure Messaging.  Traffic on the link is expected
 to be low. 
  
 Patch 6 introduces admin queries which allow information to be retrieved
 from VistA relating to patients, their providers, the clinics where they
 were seen, and the Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) teams they are
 assigned to.  MHV*1*6 introduces four HL7 protocols, MHVSM QBP-Q11 Event
 Driver protocol, MHVSM QBP-Q11 Subscriber Protocol, MHVSM RSP-K11 Event 
 Driver, and MHVSM RSP-K11 Subscriber Protocol.
  
 MHV*1*6 implements nine HL7 queries to support administration and daily
 operation of the Secure Messaging enterprise system.
  
 These queries are as follows:
  
 Demographics query    - Allows Internal Entry number (IEN), Integration
                         control number (ICN), or Social Security Number
                         (SSN) inquiry and returns demographic information
  
 User Lookup           - Allows name inquiry, or blank to return all users
 PCMM Providers        - Allows name inquiry, or blank to return all
                         PCMM providers
 Patients For Clinic   - Lookup patients by clinic IEN and date range.
 Patients for Team     - Lookup patients by team IEN and date range.
 Patient for Provider  - Lookup patients by Provider IEN and date range.
 Team Lookup           - Lookup by Team Name or blank for all teams.
 Clinic Lookup         - Lookup by clinic name or blanks for all clinics.
 Patient Relationships - Lookup by patient IEN and date range.  Returns
                         clinics, teams, and providers for the date range.
  
  
 The pre-init routine PRE^MHV1P6 turns on MHV Application Logging.
  
 The post-init routine POST^MHV1P6 adds entries to MHV REQUEST
 TYPE(#2275.3) to define the queries and the associated parameters required
 to make them function, and to MHV RESPONSE MAP(#2275.4) to map the HL7
 protocols for secure messaging.  The post-init also turns off MHV
 application logging.
