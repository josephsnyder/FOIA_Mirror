Description:
============

 MHV*1*5 Secure Messaging
  
 Summary
 -------
 MHV*1*5 delivers HL7 interfaces needed to support Secure Messaging.
 Secure Messaging leverages the existing TIUHL7 interface to save message
 threads as progress notes.  MHV*1*5 installs the components necessary to
 use the TIUHL7 interface.  MHV*1*5 also installs a new demographics query
 used to support secure messaging.
  
 Detailed Description
 --------------------
 Secure Messaging allows patients and clinicians to email each other 
 securely and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those 
 email threads to the medical record as progress notes.  
  
 Relationships between patients and clinicians are established based 
 on Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) providers, clinic appointments
 and Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) teams.  Secure Messaging uses
 triage groups based on these relationships to manage which patients are
 able to email which providers.  More information on secure messaging can
 be found on the MyHealtheVet (MHV) product web site (intranet)
 http://vaww1.va.gov/MyHealtheVet/, and MHV web site www.myhealth.va.gov.
  
 This patch allows the secure messaging server to communicate with VistA.  
 After the software is released, Secure Messaging must be implemented from
 the business aspect.  This will be done in stages, making it some time
 before all medical centers are using it.  Each site has designated a point
 of contact to represent the site on MHV national calls.  More information
 on the rollout is available through the site point of contact.  The MHVVA
 logical link was distributed in MHV*1*2, and is already enabled and set
 for autostart.  Traffic on the MHVVA logical link will not begin until
 your site starts using Secure Messaging.  Traffic on the link is expected
 to be low. 
  
 Secure Messaging leverages the TIUHL7 interface updated with TIU*1*228.
 Full details of this interface can be found in the Generic HL7 Interface
 Handbook of the CPRS: Text Integration Utility (TIU) document on the 
 VistA Documentation Library. In short, the interface accepts an MDM^T02
 HL7 message and will create a progress note.  To enable this
 functionality, MHV*1*5 installs two new protocols: MHVSM MDM-T02 Event
 Driver Protocol, and MHVSM MDM-T02 Subscriber Protocol.  It also installs
 two new HL7 application parameters: MHV SM, and MHV TIU.
  
 MHV*1*5 adds the SECURE MESSAGING clinic as a new entry in the
 HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).
  
 MHV*1*5 implements an HL7 query interface for demographic information.
 Four new protocols are released: MHVSM QRY-A19 Event Driver, MHVSM
 QRY-A19 Subscriber, MHVSM ADR-A19 Event Driver, and MHVSM ADR-A19
 Subscriber.
  
 MHV*1*5 modifies the UPDMAP utility in MHVU2 so that the BOUNDARY SEGMENT
 field (#.04) of the MHV RESPONSE MAP file (#2275.4) is not required.  It
 also modifies the UPDREQ utility in MHVU2 so that the BUILDER ROUTINE
 field (#.06) of the MHV REQUEST TYPE file (#2275.3) is not required.
  
 The pre-init routine PRE^MHV1P5 turns on MHV Application Logging.  The
 post-init routine POST^MHV1P5 adds SECURE MESSAGING as a clinic and also 
 turns off MHV Application Logging.
