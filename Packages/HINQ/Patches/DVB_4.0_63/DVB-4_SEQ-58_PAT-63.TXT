Subject: FILE FULL ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch addresses the following problem:
  
  When a HINQ response is received for a patient that has more than 10 
  dependents, a file full error occurs.  The error is occurring because
  when the system goes past the 10th dependent it re-starts and then 
  goes into a continuous loop which is causing the full file error.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
   1) HD0000000316919 - System logging errors
   
   Problem:
   ========
   When a HINQ response is received for a patient that has more than 10 
   dependents, a file full error occurs.  This issue occurs because the
   software writes data to a file as it is processing the dependents.  
   While processing the dependents, once the software goes past the tenth
   dependent, it truncates the dependent number, causing it to re-start at
   a previous dependent.  The software then continues to loop infinitely 
   producing a file full error.
  
  
   Solution:
   =========
   The routines DVBHQR11, and DVBHQM2 have been corrected to prevent this 
   problem from occurring again.  The routines were modified so that the 
   dependent number is no longer truncated.  This prevents the software from
   looping infinitely and producing a file full error.    
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
  This patch may be run with users on the system. As several options are 
  going to be out of order, it is recommended that this patch be installed
