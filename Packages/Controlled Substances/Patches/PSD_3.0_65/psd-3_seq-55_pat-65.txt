 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s)
 ============================
 1)HD0000000169083 - Vault Setup
  
    Problem
    -------
    In Controlled Substances, under the Site Parameters option (PSD SITE),
    the user is unable to add an inpatient site.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Modified the PSDSITE routine to allow the user to add an inpatient
    site.
  
    Technical
    ---------
    Routine PSDSITE was incorrectly setting the DLAYGO variable:
       S (DIC,DLAYGO)="^PS(59.4,"
    Whereas it should only contain the file number and not the root global:
       S DIC="^PS(59.4,",DLAYGO=59.4
  
 2)HD0000000098252 - Daily Activity Log does not record change on CS 
 invoice
  
    Problem
    -------
    After a Drug Accountability Verified Invoice has been edited, the Daily
    Activity report does not properly display Drug Accountability
    adjustments.
  
    Solution
    --------
    The PSDACT1 routine will be modified to check for the Drug
    Accountability Invoice information.  If that information exists, the
    "GS#" label will be replaced with the invoice number that is stored in
    the adjusted transaction.
  
    Technical
    ---------
    The PSDACT1 routine will be modified in the T14 label to set the
    variable TEXT="EDIT VERIFIED ORDER". It will also check to see if the
    PRIME VENDOR INVOICE and PRIME VENDOR ORDER NUMBER exist.  If they do,
    the NUM variable will be set to the PRIME VENDOR ORDER NUMBER.
  
 3) HD0000000168800 - Inventory issued to NAOU somehow was doubled by Nurse
  
    Problem
    -------
    The Ward Nurse used the PSD REC GS option to accept an update from
    Pharmacy. During this acceptance the inventory was doubled from 10
    units to 20, even though only 10 units were involved. Pharmacy was
    able to correct the problem, and the current inventory reflects the 
    actual inventory. This problem is caused by two users being allowed to
    access the same Green Sheet at the same time.
  
    Solution
    --------
    The PSDNRGS routine will be modified to lock the Green Sheet at the
    moment the user begins the receipt process.
  
    Technical
    ---------
    The PSDNRGS routine will be modified to incrementally lock the DRUG
    ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION file (#58.81) at the transaction number
    level.
