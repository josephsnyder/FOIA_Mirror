Description:
============

 This patch will fix a problem introduced by patch PSD*3*56.
 When a PCA/Syringe is already signed out to a patient and that
 green sheet and patient are transferred to another NAOU, the 
 quantity is subtracted from the sending NAOU and added to the
 receiving NAOU even though it has already been signed out to
 the patient.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================

                         install
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When a PCA/Syringe is already signed out to a patient and that
 green sheet and patient are transferred to another NAOU, the 
 quantity is subtracted from the sending NAOU and added to the
 receiving NAOU even though it has already been signed out to
 the patient.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Create new menu options Transfer GS for PCA/Infusion Signed
 Out to Patient [PSD GS TRANS PCA/INF PATIENT] and Receive GS for 
 PCA/Infusion Signed Out to Patient [PSD GS REC PCA/INF FOR PATIENT] 
 so the quantity is not subtracted from the sending NAOU or added to 
 the receiving NAOU.  These new menu options will only be used if the 
 Green Sheet quantity remaining equals 0 (green sheet quantity-quantity
 signed out to patient-delayed wastage-defective dose+return to stock=0)
 otherwise the Transfer Green Sheet and Drug to another NAOU [PSD NURSE 
 TRANSFER GS] and Receive Green Sheet & Drug from another NAOU [PSD NURSE 
 REC TRANSFER GS] should be used.
 These menu options will reside under the Transfer Green Sheet Menu
 [PSD NURSE TRANS GS MENU] and the Infusion Order Processing Menu [PSD 
 INFUSION MENU].
