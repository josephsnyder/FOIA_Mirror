  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ----------------
   
  1.  HD0000000064612 - ERI-0105-20214 Problem completing encounters
  
    
  Problem:
  --------
  From the New Clinic Visits [NEW CLINIC VISITS ACKQAS VISIT ENTRY] menu
  option, when checking out a patient that has the Combat Classification,
  the prompt does not display allowing the user to answer the Combat
  questions for the visit. This creates a visit with the status of Act
  Req/Checked Out in the Scheduling module which requires the user to
  take an extra step and go to the Appointment Management [SDAM APPT 
  MGT] menu option and perform the CO Check Out function and answer the
  Combat question before the Checkout is complete.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A modification was made to the input template [ACKQAS VISIT ENTRY] for 
  A&SP CLINIC VISIT file (#509850.6) that prompts the user for HEAD
  and/or NECK CANCER and COMBAT classifications when appropriate. Two new
  fields HEAD AND/OR NECK CANCER (#40) and COMBAT VETERAN (#45) were also
  added to the A&SP CLINIC VISIT file (#509850.6) to store the responses
  before transmitting the checkout information to Patient Care Encounter.
  Post Install routine ACKQ316P will recompile the input templates 
  associated with these 2 fields.
