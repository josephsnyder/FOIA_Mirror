Subject: PROBLEM IN CPRS V27 WHEN DISPLAYING REASON FOR STUDY FIELD ON REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue for those facilities running 
 CPRS V27:
  
 When selecting the same report twice or more in the same
 session the first time the report includes REASON FOR STUDY, all
 subsequent report displays do not.
  
 To reproduce this on both the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and List 
 Manager (LM) reports tabs select the same report two or more times 
 within the same session.  The first time the report display includes
 REASON FOR STUDY, the subsequent report displays do not.
                                                         
 VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine options directly impacted by this patch:
  -Display a Rad/Nuc Med Report [RA RPTDISP]
  -Draft Report (Reprint) [RA REPRINT]
  -Select Report to Print by Patient [RA RPTPAT]
  
 CPRS V26 does not recognize the REASON FOR STUDY data attribute.
 Therefore, the issue of whether REASON FOR STUDY is displayed on "Imaging
 (Local only)" and "Radiology/Imaging" reports is non-existent 
 at facilities running CPRS V26.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
           
 This patch should be queued for installation when all 
 Radiology/Nuclear users are off the system since all RADIOLOGY/NUCLEAR 
 MEDICINE options and protocols will be marked out of service.   
 Install time will be less than 2 minutes.
      
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the

         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.

         RA*
   
         When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of 
         Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
         protocols:
