Description:
============

 Please take note that the release of RA*5.0*86 will be backward
 compatible to Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) v26.
 This patch was written to evaluate the version of CPRS running at
 the facility where installed and execute the CPRS and Vista 
 Radiology/Nuclear Medicine specific business rules as they apply
 to the placement of a radiology specific patient order.
  
 Description of the issue which has had its genesis with the advent of
 CPRSv27:
  
 If, when signing a radiology order in CPRS (version 27 or greater), the
 requesting location (a record in the HOSPITAL LOCATION #44 file) is
 defined as a clinic and the patient class for the patient is an inpatient,
 VistA Radiology returns the following error message to the user
 in CPRS (version 27 or greater): "Patient Class disagrees with Patient
 Location" and the order is rejected by the event subscriber.
  
  
 This same error occurs if the requesting location is defined as a ward and
 the patient class for the patient is an outpatient.
  
 Here are a couple of typical scenarios: 
 ---------------------------------------
 Inpatients are seen in specialty clinics such as audiology and
 hemodialysis as part of a consult.
  
 An outpatient has regularly scheduled clinic appointments such
 hemodialysis. When that patient is admitted, he/she continues to be seen
 in hemodialysis clinic, only now as an inpatient.
  
 An outpatient is being seen in his regularly scheduled clinic appointment 
 and during the course of the visit decompensates and is admitted, but is 
 still physically in the clinic receiving care until transport to the ward 
 can be arranged.
  
 Screening logic change for HOSPITAL LOCATION lookups
 ----------------------------------------------------
 As a result of this patch the screening logic used to display wards to 
 the user has changed. Prior to RA*5.0*86 a hospital location was deemed a 
 ward if the TYPE (#2) field for a record in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file 
 was set to 'W'. With the release of RA*5.0*86 a hospital location will be 
 deemed a ward if:
  
 1) The HOSPITAL LOCATION record points to a record in the WARD LOCATION
    (#42) file. Note: this HOSPITAL LOCATION record cannot be defined with
    a TYPE attribute of 'Clinic', 'File Area', or 'Imaging'.
 2) The "pointed to" WARD LOCATION location record must point back to the
    correct HOSPITAL LOCATION record.
  
 Once the hospital location is deemed to be a ward a check is made to
 determine if the ward is active.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 Since input templates are being re-compiled, it is best if this patch
 is installed outside of normal working hours. Radiology users should be
 off the system and users should not place radiology orders through CPRS
 while this patch is being installed. The install time for this patch
 should be under five minutes.
  
 NOTE: MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
       avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
  
  1.  Use the 'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] option to delete the following
      compiled routines for the following input templates:
  
      File                  Input Template       Compiled Routine Namespace
      ----                  --------------       --------------------------
      RAD/NUC MED ORDERS    RA ORDER EXAM        RACTOE*
                            RA QUICK EXAM ORDER  RACTQE*
  
      RAD/NUC MED PATIENT   RA REGISTER          RACTRG*
  
      We suggest that this step be taken so that re-compilation of the RA
      ORDER EXAM, RA QUICK EXAM ORDER, & RA REGISTER input templates
      guarantee a new set of compiled input template routines. Failure to
      delete the compiled input template routines for the RA ORDER EXAM, RA
      QUICK EXAM ORDER, & RA REGISTER input templates will not prevent
      installation of this patch.
      
      Here is an example of using the 'Delete Routines' option:
  
      Select the 'Systems Manager Menu' via EVE. You should see a number of
      items under the Systems Manager Menu. This is the option you want to 
      select:
  
           Programmer Options ... 
  
      Select Systems Manager Menu Option:  Programmer Options
      You should see a number of items under the Programmer Options Menu.
      This is the option you want to select:
  
           Routine Tools ...
  
      Select Programmer Options Option:  Routine Tools
      You should see a number of items under the Routine Tools Menu. This
      is the option you want to select:
  
           Delete Routines 
  
      Select Routine Tools Option: Delete Routines
  
      ROUTINE DELETE
  
      All Routines? No => No   Be very deliberate when answering this
                               question!
  
      Routine: RACTOE*
      Routine: RACTQE*
      Routine: RACTRG*
      
      Please note that the RA ORDER EXAM, RA QUICK EXAM ORDER, & RA 
      REGISTER input templates will be recompiled during the installation
      of RA*5.0*86.
  
  
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
      the KIDS distribution onto your system. 
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the 'Installation' menu.
  
      From this menu you may select the following options prior to 
      installing the patch:
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.
    
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed.
    
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  4.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
      When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*86
   
       When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//", respond NO.
   
       When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options and
       Protocols? YES//", respond YES
  
         When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
         enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med options:
      
         RA*
   
         When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of 
         Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
         protocols:
   
         RA*
   
  5.  Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
      KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
      PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*86).
  
  6.  The pre and post-init routine, RA86PST, can be deleted.
  
  7.  All radiology, and those users utilizing CPRS to place radiology 
      orders, can resume their normal activities.
