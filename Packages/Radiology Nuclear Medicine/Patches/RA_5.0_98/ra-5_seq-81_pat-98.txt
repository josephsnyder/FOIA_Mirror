Subject: RADIOLOGY ORDER FILE CLEANUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
      
 1. Cleanup of the Radiology Order File (#75.1). 
    Unwanted Carriage Return/Line Feed characters are being entered 
    into the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS file (#75.1). 
  
 2. Unwanted Carriage Return/Line Feed characters are being entered in the 
    RAD/NUC MED ORDERS file (#75.1) via CPRS v27.  This creates an issue
    for some Voice Recognition products as they cannot handle the CR/LF
    characters. A temporary solution to this problem will be to strip 
    the CR/LF characters upon posting of the data to the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS
    file (#75.1)

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1.  HD0000000278814 - Cleanup file 75.1     
          
 Problem #1:  
 -----------
 The Reason for Study field is required with the installation of CPRS v27.
 When users cut and paste data into the Reason for Study field, unwanted
 carriage return/line feed characters are recorded with the data.
 CPRS v27 will be modified to strip the CR/LF characters.  A method is
 needed to remove all CR/LF characters from the existing data in RAD/NUC 
 MED ORDERS file (#75.1).
        
 Resolution #1:
 --------------     
 A post-init routine will be included with this patch for the purpose of 
 examining the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS (#75.1) and stripping out all 
 CR/LF characters from the Reason for Study field (#1.1)
        
 2.  HD0000000278815 - Strip CR/LF from the Reason for Study
  
 Problem #2:
 ----------
 Unwanted Carriage Return/Line Feed characters are not being stripped by 
 CPRS v27 for the new REASON FOR STUDY field (#1.1) when Radiology
 Order data is recorded into the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS (#75.1).
        
 Resolution #2:
 --------------
 Modifications will be made to routine RAO7RON1 to strip the CR/LF characters
 from the REASON FOR STUDY FIELD (#1.1) before the data is filed into 
 the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS (#75.1).
