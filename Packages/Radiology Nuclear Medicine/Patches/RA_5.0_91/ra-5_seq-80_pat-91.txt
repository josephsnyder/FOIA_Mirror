Subject: RVU REPORTS SHOWING SOME INCORRECT RVU VALUES 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When running  wRVU (Work Relative Value Unit) reports, the Radiology
 package is attempting to use last year's (2007) wRVU data because this
 year's (2008) is not yet available.  Based on the way the flag is set to
 determine which year's data to use, the system is sometimes retrieving
 incorrect wRVU data.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 Problem 
 -------
 When running  wRVU reports, the Radiology package is attempting to 
 use last year's (2007) wRVU data because this year's (2008) is not yet
 available.  Based on the way the flag is set to determine which year's
 data to use, the system is sometimes retrieving incorrect wRVU data.
      
 Resolution 
 ----------
 Routines RAWKLU and RAWKLU2 will be modified to use the 
 requested report end date instead of the current date to set the flag
 that determines which years data to use and these routines will now 
 use the Radiology report date instead of the exam date to retrieve
 wRVU data. 
              
   
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
