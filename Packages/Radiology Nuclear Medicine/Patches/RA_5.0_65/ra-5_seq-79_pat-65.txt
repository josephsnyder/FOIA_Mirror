Description:
============

 The Pharmacy Encapsulation Cycle I project requires that all direct 
 references to Pharmacy files be replaced by new Pharmacy APIs.  Thus, 
 changes to coding, data definition, and templates have been made to the
 medication and radiopharmaceutical portions of the Radiology package.
  
 From the user's perspective, except for two minor display changes, these
 portions of the package should function the same way as before this
 patch.  The minor display changes are described in detail in the released
 notes associated with this patch.
  
 The affected portions of the Radiology package are outlined below.
  
 -------
 Options
 -------
  
 Patient case data entry:
  
         Case No. Exam Edit [RA EDITCN]
         Edit Exam by Patient [RA EDITPT]
         Status Tracking of Exams [RA STATRACK]
  
 Other data entry:
  
         Lot (Radiopharmaceutical) Number Enter/Edit [RA NM EDIT LOT]
         Procedure Enter/Edit [RA PROCEDURE]
  
 Procedure listings:
  
         Active Procedure List (Long) [RA PROCLONG]
         Inactive Procedure List (Long) [RA INACPRCLONG]

      Field 5  RADIOPHARM
           removed this field's Fileman Identifier
           and removed data screen DIC("S")
          
 --------
 Routines 
 --------
  
 RA65PST was added to delete the Fileman Identifier from the 
 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL LOT file, #71.9, RADIOPHARM field, (#5), and to set a 
 Fileman "WRITE" node to display the RADIOPHARM data whenever a Fileman 
 lookup is done on this file.  The changes were made in order to use the 
 Pharmacy API to display RADIOPHARM during Fileman lookup.
  
 RADD1 was modified to remove some code that is no longer needed, due to 
 switching to the new Pharmacy API.
  
 RADD3 was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to store the RADIOPHARM
 data for a radiopharmaceutical lot record this is added on-the-fly from
 any of the three exam edit options:
  
           Status Tracking of Exams [RA STATRACK]
           Case No. Exam Edit [RA EDITCN]
           Edit Exam by Patient [RA EDITPT]
  
 RADD4 was modified to remove some code that is no longer needed, due to 
 switching to the new Pharmacy API.
  
 RADOSTIK was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to retrieve the 
 radiopharmaceutical generic drug name.
  
 RAMAIN2 was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to retrieve the 
 radiopharmaceutical generic drug name.
  
 RANMED1 was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to enter 
 radiopharmaceutical data and include the same help prompt and text that 
 previously came from Fileman.  The switch to the new Pharmacy API results
 in slight changes in some user interactive sessions, such as jumping from
 field to field.  Please refer to the Released Notes (RA5_0RN_65.PDF) for
 detailed explanation and examples.
  
 RANMUSE2 was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to display 
 radiopharmaceutical's generic drug name.
  
 RANMUSE3 was modified to correct an error that appears if there are no 
 data for the selected time frame.  The bug was discovered during unit 
 testing.  This is a bug fix and does not involve the new Pharmacy API.
  
 RANMUTL1 was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to select one or more 
 radiopharmaceuticals from the DRUG file, #50.
  
 RAPSAPI was added to handle common logic needed by routines RA65PST,
 RADD3, RADOSTIK, RANMED1, RANMUSE2, RANMUTL1, and RASTREQN to use the new
 Pharmacy API for displaying generic drug names, for screening and 
 selecting drug data by VA CLASSIFICATION.
  
 RAPSAPI2 was added to handle common logic for deleting and getting
 help prompts for medication and radiopharmaceuticals.
  
 RAPSAPI3 was added to handle common logic for editing medication and 
 radiopharmaceuticals from case edit and status tracking options.
  
 RASTREQN was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to display the 
 radiopharmaceutical's generic drug name and also to remove extra blank 
 lines after checking general required fields.
  
 ---------------
 Input Templates
 ---------------
  
 [RA EXAM EDIT] from the RAD/NUC MED PATIENT file, #70, was modified to use
 the new Pharmacy API to handle data entry of medications and 
 radiopharmaceuticals.  This input template is used by the following 
 options:
           'Case No. Exam Edit' [RA EDITCN]
           'Edit Exam by Patient' [RA EDITPT]
  
 [RA STATUS CHANGE] from the RAD/NUC MED PATIENT file, #70, was modified to
 use the new Pharmacy API to handle data entry of medications and 
 radiopharmaceuticals.  This input template is used by the following
 option:
           'Status Tracking of Exams' [RA STATRACK]
  
 [RA PROCEDURE EDIT] from the RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURES file, #71, was 
 modified to use the new Pharmacy API to handle data entry of default 
 medications and default radiopharmaceuticals.  This input template is 
 used by the following option:
  
           'Procedure Enter/Edit' [RA PROCEDURE] option.
  
 --------------
 Print Template
 --------------
 [RA PROCEDURE LIST] was modified to use the new Pharmacy API to display 
 the generic drug name of radiopharmaceuticals and medications, and to 
 remove the display of a stray variable, RAZ71, in the output of three 
 options:  
         'Active Procedure List (Long)' [RA PROCLONG]
         'Inactive Procedure List' (Long) [RA INACPRCLONG]
         'Series of Procedures List' [RA PROCSERIES].

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   The install time for this patch should take less than 5 minutes.  
 Because this patch affects data entry of exams, all Radiology users must 
 be off the system during the installation.
  
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  
  1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
   
  2. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
   
  3. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
  
        When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*65.
  
        When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        NO//", respond NO.
   
        When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options
        and Protocols? YES//", respond YES.      
  
        When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark
        as 'Out of Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
        options:
      
           RA*
   
        When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
        Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
   
           RA*
   
     4. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*65).
  
     5. Upon successful completion of the installation, the post install   
        routine, RA65PST may be deleted.
