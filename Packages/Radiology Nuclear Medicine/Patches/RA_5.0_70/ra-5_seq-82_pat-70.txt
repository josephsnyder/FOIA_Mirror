Description:
============

  
  *************************************************************************
  * This patch is in support of the EVC R2. The implementation of EVC R2  *
  * at all sites is an emergency release 24-hour compliance and scheduled *
  * for installation on Saturday March 28, 2009.  Therefore, the          *
  * compliance date to have this patch installed at all sites is no later *
  * than Sunday March 29, 2009 by 8 am EST.  Failure to install within    *
  * this timeframe may result in corrupting data or missing data at the   *
  * facilities.                                                           *
  *************************************************************************
  
 The installation of the Project 112/Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD) 
 clinical application enhancements will provide sites the ability to 
 collect and store SHAD exposure information related to provided medical 
 care, and to share that information with PCE. It will also rename the 
 "Environmental Contaminants" (EC) label to "Southwest Asia Conditions" 
 (SWAC), while keeping internal values for "EC" the same.
  
 New prompts will be displayed and some screen/report will be reformatted: 
  
    The new PRIMARY DX RELATED TO SHAD field (#100) of the RAD/NUC MED
    ORDERS file (#75.1) will appear on Radiology Reports.
  
    The Southwest Asia Condition label will appear on reports and screen 
    prompts in place of the Environmental Contaminants label.  
  
    The default for the "Was treatment related to Combat Vet (Combat 
    Related)?" prompt will always be "Yes".  If the provider copied a 
    previous order's ordering diagnoses and clinical indicators, the
    default would still be "Yes" for this prompt even though its value from
    the previous order may be "No".  This enhancement supports a VA Chief
    Business Office request that the care provided to combat veterans is 
    presumed to be related to their combat experience.
  
 The changes in this patch affect the storage of ordered data received 
 from CPRS GUI.  They also affect the following options where new orders
 may be placed from the Radiology application:
  
    Add Exams to Last Visit [RA ADDEXAM]
    Register Patient for Exams [RA REG]
    Request an Exam [RA ORDEREXAM]
  
 No additional processing time should be noticed as a result of these 
 modifications.
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY MODIFIED
 ========================
  
 This patch adds two "SHAD" related fields:
  
   PRIMARY DX RELATED TO SHAD field (#100) of the 
   RAD/NUC MED ORDERS file (#75.1)
  
   SECONDARY DX RELATED TO SHAD field (#9) of the 
   RAD/NUC MED ORDERS subfile (#75.13)
  
 This patch replaces "EC" with "SWAC" in these two fields:
  
   PRIMARY DX RELATED TO SWAC field (#95) of the
   RAD/NUC MED ORDERS file (#75.1)
  
   SECONDARY DX RELATED TO SWAC field (#5) of the
   RAD/NUC MED ORDERS subfile (#75.13)
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS
 =========================
 138200 Radiology Report EI Display.
  
   The following reports have been modified to correct a defect that caused
   an inconsistent display of a comma "," between environmental indicators.
     Detail Request Display [RA ORDERDISPLAY]
     Print Rad/Nuc/ Med Requests by date [RA ORDERPRINTS]
     Print Selected Requests by Patient [RA ORDERPRINTPAT]
  
 275308 Radiology order problems after install of CPRS
  
 276045 Errors w/ Radiology Orders related to CIDC
        (duplicate of 275308)
  
   The above tickets were submitted to report filing errors that occur 
 when CPRS 27 is installed without this patch (RA*5*70) and the CIDC switch
 is turned on.  The filing errors are due to absence of SHAD related fields
 in Radiology.  Installation of this patch will provide the two new SHAD
 fields that CPRS 27 expects to be in Radiology.

 ROUTINES MODIFIED
 =================
  
 1.) RABWIBB2 is modified to include the PRIMARY DX RELATED TO SHAD field 
 (#100) of the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS file (#75.1) in the $$GETACCT^IBBAPI
 call.
  
 2.) RABWORD is modified to display the Project 112/SHAD indicator in 
 addition to 
 the other environmental indicators.  It is also modified to set "Yes" as 
 the default value to the "Was treatment related to Combat Vet (Combat 
 Related)?" prompt.
  
 3.) RABWORD1 modified to display the SC/EC/EI/MST/SHAD/HNC responses
 associated to each ICD diagnosis. The display value "EC" will be changed 
 to "SWAC".
  
 4.) RABWORD2 modified to display the Project 112/SHAD and SWAC Indicator
 status to the user.
  
 5.) RABWPCE modified to include the PROJECT 112/SHAD indicator in the data
 passed to Patient Care Encounter (PCE).
  
 6.) RABWUTL modified to display the Project 112/SHAD indicator on various
 Radiology Reports.  Remedy HD0000000138200 is also addressed in this
 routine. The "EC" display value will be changed to "SWAC".

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
  The install time for this patch is less than five minutes.  Since the
  entire exam status mechanism may be affected, you should install this 
  patch at a time when Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system.
   
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system 
  to avoid problems loading and installing this patch.

      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
