Subject: FIX RA MODIFIER OPTION ISSUE; UNDEFINED ERROR AND PROPER SSN DISPLAY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 3 issues:
      
 #1  Menu option RA Modifier appears to use too much security 
 by not recognizing users when attempting to add Procedure
 modifiers. 
      
 #2  When receiving Radiology Reports from Voice Recognition 
 products such as Power Scribe and there is no primary diagnosis
 defined for the report, an UNDEF error occurs in routine 
 RAHLO1.
                
 #3 The RA Incomplete report currently displays the entire
 patient Social Security Number. 
      
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS
 =========================
 HD0000000205080  Option file access
 HD0000000216332  RA*5.0*80 Undefined Error 
 HD0000000217642  RA INCOMPLETE REPORT with last 4 SSN
        
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem #1 HD0000000205080
 -------
 When a user attempts to enter procedure modifiers in 
 menu option [RA MODIFIER], they receive question 
 marks (??) indicating they do not have the correct 
 permission level. 
      
 Resolution #1
 ----------
 A modification will be made in routine RAMAIN to deliver
 the file number (71.2) to FILEMAN's DLAYGO variable for 
 processing instead of the File Root reference (^RAMIS(71.2,) 
 which is causing FILEMAN to not allow adding entries to the file.
         
 Problem #2  HD0000000216332
 -------
 Sites using some Voice Recognition Software packages such as 
 Power Scribe have the ability to send Radiology Reports to VistA 
 without a primary diagnosis.  This will create an UNDEF error 
 to occur in routine RAHLO1 during the process of receiving the 
 report.
      
 Resolution #2
 ----------
 A modification will be made in routine RAHLO1 to eliminate
 the UNDEF error and continue processing properly.
      
 Problem #3  HD0000000217642
 -------
 When utilizing menu option [RA INCOMPLETE] the patient's 
 full Social Security Number is displayed on the report.
     
 Resolution #3
 ----------
 A modification will be made in routine RADLQ3
 to display only the last four digits of the patient's Social
 Security Number on the [RA INCOMPLETE] report.
