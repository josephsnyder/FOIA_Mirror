Subject: Query the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application for results

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 RA*5.0*78 allows the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application to
 accept an inbound query from ScImage and return radiology results back to
 ScImage. This historical information serves as a reference for the
 teleradiologists working for the National Teleradiology Project (NTP).
  
 Note: ScImage is a specific vendor. The query was developed to be vendor 
 independent, however ScImage is the vendor currently contracted by the 
 NTP. 
  
 *** ATTENTION - for present NTP sites (only), when installing RA*5.0*78
 it is critical this vendor be contacted to turn off the NTP Query
 component of the interface. Contact the Outlook mail group VHA NTP
 CONFIGURATION SUPPORT to coordinate VA facility and vendor implementation
 and configuration. ***
  
 There are two different sort criteria for the query. The client (ScImage) 
 can request results based on:
 * A single accession number (one patient/one result)
 * A patient, within a patient care event date/time window, & 
   maximum number of results to be returned.
  
 In order to operate properly, the following conditions must be met:
  
 1) Determine the IP address of the HLO multi-threaded listener. The 
    listener is setup as a TCP/IP service and is defined to 'listen' on
    port 5001. This information is necessary for ScImage to properly
    communicate with the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application.
  
 2) For first time NTP integration at VA facilities, the RA-SCIMAGE logical
    link must have the following fields defined with the following values:
      
      Field Name              Field Number       Field Value
      ----------              ------------       -----------
      TCP/IP PORT                400.02             21999
      TCP/IP PORT (OPTIMIZED)    400.08             21998
  
 Note: Some facilities went on-line with NTP when they installed 
       RA*5.0*84. 
       * Coordinate with the NTP troubleshooting staff to change the value
         of the TCP/IP PORT to 21999 on the VistA-side of the interface, so
         that the same TCP/IP PORT value of 21999 is applied to the NTP
         server.
       * A number of facilities have acted as test sites for RA*5.0*78. 
         These test sites may have a different value in the TCP/IP PORT
         (OPTIMIZED) field than the suggested value of 21998. Those sites
         should not change their TCP/IP PORT (OPTIMIZED) value.
       * Contact the NTP troubleshooting staff via Outlook at mail group: 
         VHA NTP ERROR or call: 650-615-6063 or 650-814-3660.

 MAIL GROUP
 ----------
 RAD HL7 MESSAGES
  
 The purpose of the RAD HL7 MESSAGES mail group is to identify a core set 
 of radiology support staff that monitor Health Level Seven (HL7)
 broadcasts between the Vista Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application and
 Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) products. Email messages are sent to
 this mail group, specifically the members of this mail group, whenever an
 COTS inbound HL7 message is received by VistA and the VistA-side business
 rules find the HL7 message is deficient.
  
 When installing this patch the user is asked to identify the coordinator
 of the 'RAD HL7 MESSAGES' Mail Group.
  
 "Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'RAD HL7 MESSAGES':"
  
 If your site has a Radiology ADPAC, identify that Radiology ADPAC as the 
 coordinator of the mail group.
  
 Additional recipients of the message, known as 'Members', can be added 
 when editing the mail group using the option: 'Mail Group Edit'.
  
 (Menu patch: Manage Mailman -> Group/Distribution Management -> Mail 
 Group Edit)
  
 Additional members to this mail group can be the backup Radiology ADPAC
 and the software support personnel responsible for the VistA
 Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application at your facility.
  
 Note: POSTMASTER must be added as a member of this mail group in order to
 have messages broadcast to the RAD HL7 MESSAGES mail group.
  
 When prompted the person entering the additional members should set their 
 TYPE to INFO. INFO indicates that the message is transmitted to all
 members as an informational message. Members cannot reply to informational
 messages.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with Radiology users on the system. Install
 time will be less than 2 minutes.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
      
  2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
     menu, select the Installation menu.
      
  3. From this menu, you should use the following options.  And you 
     must use the 'Backup a Transport Global' to save the routines 
     that are affected by this patch.
  
     (When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RA*5.0*78).  
      
     a. 'Print Transport Global' - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
  
     b.  'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
  
     c.  'Compare Transport Global to Current System'  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     d.  'Backup a Transport Global' - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      
  4. Shut down the 'RA-SCIMAGE' Radiology HL logical link using the 
     'Start/Stop Links [HL START]' option.
  
  5. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option and select the package
     RA*5.0*78.
      
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO
      
  7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
  8. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
     KIDS Utilities '[XPD UTILITY]' option 'Install File Print' [XPD PRINT
     INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*78).
  
  
 Post Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
 After installation of RA*5.0*78 the RA-SCIMAGE logical link will need to
 be edited.
  
 Follow this menu path to edit RA-SCIMAGE:
  
 Select OPTION NAME: HLO MAIN MENU       HL7 (Optimized) MAIN MENU
  
    SM     HLO SYSTEM MONITOR
    MV     HLO MESSAGE VIEWER
    APPS   HLO APPPLICATION REGISTRY
    STAT   HLO MESSAGE STATISTICS
    ES     HLO ERROR STATISTICS
    EL     Link Edit <-- this is the option
  
 Select HL7 (Optimized) MAIN MENU Option:  Link Edit 
  
 Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE: RA-SCIMAGE <-- this is the logical link
  
 The fields that need to be edited are:
 DNS DOMAIN (#.08)
 TCP/IP PORT (OPTIMIZED) (#400.08)
  
 1 - Ask the network manager the Domain Name Servers (DNS) value for the
     local NTP Gateway Server. The DNS value is nothing more than the 
     translation of the IP ADDRESS value of the RA-SCIMAGE logical link
     into a human-readable domain name value.
  
 2 - Enter the DNS value of the NTP Gateway Server into the DNS DOMAIN
     field.
  
 3 - Sites installing this patch for the first time must enter the agreed
     to port number (21998) into the TCP/IP PORT (OPTIMIZED) field.
  
  
 Please make sure that the MEMBER sub-file of the 'RAD HL7 MESSAGES' 
 mail group is populated with active facility personnel in addition to 
 POSTMASTER.
