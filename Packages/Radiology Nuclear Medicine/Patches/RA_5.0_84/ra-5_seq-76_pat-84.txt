Subject: VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine teleradiology initiative

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch supports a VHA National Radiology Program office initiative to 
 integrate teleradiology (remote-read) reports into VistA. A new National 
 Teleradiology Program (NTP) reading center has been established in 
 California, staffed by VHA radiologists; VA medical centers may contract 
 with the NTP to provide daytime or after-hours interpretation of imaging 
 studies.
  
 Please note:
 ------------
 XINDEX will generate errors and warnings when run for this build.
  
 The errors reflect the reference to three routines that are part of an 
 unreleased patch (RA*5.0*47). RA*5.0*47 will not be released in the near 
 term (within three months).  The references to those routines are simply
 checking if the routines exist in the environment, and if they do not, the
 code will not be executed.  XINDEX is unable to differentiate that the
 code is simply checking for the existence of those routines.
   
 The warnings 'Routine exceeds SACC maximum size of 10000' are due to the
 current version XINDEX following the previous Standards and Conventions (SAC)
 approved by the Standards and Conventions Committee (SACC). The new SAC
 allows routines to grow to a maximum size of 20,000 bytes (15,000 code and
 5,000 comments). When the XINDEX routines have been updated to follow the
 new SAC the routine size warnings will not be generated. The new XINDEX
 routines are due to be released in a VA Kernel patch (XU*8.0*491).
  
 Information on the new SAC standards can be found by following this 
 hyperlink: http://vista.med.va.gov/sacc/
  
 The aforementioned XINDEX issues have been reviewed and approved by our 
 VistA Software Quality Assurance professionals.
  
 List of Outstanding Anomalies: 
 ------------------------------
 - Remedy Ticket # 251440
   Description: Radiology 5.0 Reports, Low Urgency, "Patch 84 issue - extra
   carriage returns in report.
  
 - Risk/Impact: The NTP has been clinically active since November 2007.  
   Until Muskogee became active with NTP in April of this year, the
   radiologists had received no feedback that there was an issue.  Reports
   are fully examined as part of normal workflow.  There are currently 5
   sites in daily clinical work with NTP and by the time RA*5*78 goes out
   the end of August with the fix for this issue, there may be an 
   additional 2-3 sites in daily clinical work with NTP.
  
   Workaround:  A Remedy ticket has been logged to track this anomaly, and
   indicates that the issue will be resolved in patch  RA*5*78.  All active
   sites are aware of the issue that there *may be* 3-4 extra carriage
   returns in the display and to fully examine the report.
  
  
 Nine main features are provided by this patch:
  
 1.  Creates an application proxy user account called 'RADIOLOGY,OUTSIDE
 SERVICE' in the NEW PERSON (#200) file. This account is used to represent
 the nationally-credentialed radiologists at the NTP so that they do not
 need to be credentialed and privileged at each VAMC. This account does not
 have Access/Verify codes and cannot be used to log in to local VistA
 applications.
  
 DO NOT MODIFY THIS USER RECORD. A security policy is in place that 
 strictly defines the attributes of this record: see VA Directive 6504 for 
 more information. The pre-install process will update 'RADIOLOGY,OUTSIDE
 SERVICE' by assigning that NEW PERSON record a 'STAFF' Radiology/Nuclear
 Medicine classification. The 'STAFF' classification is necessary and 
 without that classification exams verified by teleradiologists will not 
 advance to an examination status of 'COMPLETE'.
  
 The post-install process will associate 'RADIOLOGY,OUTSIDE SERVICE' with
 all the active imaging locations in the IMAGING LOCATIONS (#79.1) file.
  
 Each imaging location has its own set of parameters defining
 location-specific criteria, e.g., label/header/footer formats, printer
 devices for flash cards, jacket labels requests and reports and how many
 labels to print.
  
 2.  If the facility does not have the following entries with the exact 
 internal entry numbers (IENs) the DIAGNOSTIC CODES (#78.3) file this patch
 creates five new entries with their correct IENs in the local DIAGNOSTIC
 CODE file:
  
       999    TELERADIOLOGY, NOT YET DICTATED
      1000    NO ALERT REQUIRED
      1001    SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY, ATTN NEEDED
      1002    CRITICAL ABNORMALITY
      1003    POSSIBLE MALIGNANCY
  
 If the facility does have a diagnostic code record in the DIAGNOSTIC
 CODES file within the reserved IEN range, none of the aforementioned
 records will be added to the local DIAGNOSTIC CODES file and an email 
 message will be sent to the 'VHA Radiology Informatics Committee' mail 
 group in Outlook identifying the facility with the issue. 
  
 DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE THESE DIAGNOSTIC CODES. These codes were 
 established as standard diagnostic codes for communication between the 
 teleradiology reading centers and the local VAMC sites. Codes 1001, 1002, 
 and 1003 will trigger an "Abnormal Imaging Results" notification to the 
 requesting physician, and will add the report to the "Abnormal Exam 
 Results" management report. 
  
 3.  Creates three new fields in RAD/NUC MED REPORTS (#74) file: 
  
      TELERADIOLOGY PHYSICIAN NAME (#9.1)
      TELERADIOLOGY PHYSICIAN NPI  (#9.2)
      REPORT VERIFIED BY COTS APP  (#9.3)
  
 4.  Creates two new fields in RAD/NUC MED HL7 APPLICATION EXCEPTION
     (#79.7) file:
  
      DEFAULT DX FOR 'R' REPORT (#2.1) 
      DEFAULT DX FOR 'F' REPORT (#2.2)
  
 5.  Adds 'RA-SCIMAGE-TCP' to the RAD/NUC MED HL7 APPLICATION EXCEPTION
 (#79.7) file and defines data attributes for this record.
  
 6.  Allows VistA to accept HL7 report messages (ORU) from the 
 teleradiology center, and  automatically stores them in VistA as verified 
 reports, without requiring further intervention from the local medical 
 center staff.
  
 For this patch, "Teleradiology" refers only to the services provided by 
 the NTP. VA medical centers with existing local remote reading or 
 teleradiology arrangements are not affected by RA*5.0*84; this patch is 
 solely a solution for implementing the NTP pilot program. Code 
 modifications for this project will not affect sites that aren't using 
 the NTP.
  
 7.  RA*5.0*84 exposed an issue with the data generated by the 'ABNORMAL
 REPORT' option. Some exams that should appear on the Abnormal Report did 
 not appear. This issue had to do with the way the cross-reference was 
 created on the PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE (Node: 'P'; data dictionary: 
 70.03; field: 13) field. The old traditional cross-reference has been 
 replaced with a 'New Style' cross-reference. The pre-install routine 
 exported with this patch will utilize the correct VA FileMan utility to 
 see that this business rule change is carried through to completion.
  
 Note: The primary Diagnostic Code data is found in the DIAGNOSTIC CODES
 (#78.3) file.
  
 8.  Report and exam lock logic has been updated and centralized. The
 locking and unlocking of both reports and exams happen in RAHLO1.
 LOCKX^RAHLTCPU handles exams and LOCKR^RAHLTCPU handles reports (This is a
 direct response to Ann Arbor locking issues).
  
 9. The data in the OBR-7 (Observation Date/Time) field for ORM (Order) 
 HL7 V2.3 messages has changed. Prior to this patch the date/time value 
 placed in this field was the current date/time of execution or in VA 
 FileMan NOW. This logic was correct because the message was generated
 immediately after the date/time of when the exam was registered.
  
 With the advent of the [RA HL7 RESEND BY DATE RANGE] 'Resend Radiology HL7
 Messages By Date Range' option HL7 messages can be generated and broadcast
 long after the exam registration occurred. The value of NOW raises an 
 issue because the timestamp in OBR-7 is when the [RA HL7 RESEND BY DATE 
 RANGE] option executes as opposed to the date/time of when the exam was 
 registered.
  
 After this patch the date/time value placed in OBR-7 will be the date/time
 of when the exam was registered. The date/time of registration is a far
 more accurate timestamp of when the actual patient encounter occurred.

     INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*84).
  
  9. Start up the Radiology HL logical links that were shutdown in step
     4 'Start/Stop Links [HL START]'.
        
 Post Installation Instructions:
 ============================== 
 RA*5.0*84 exports the following HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER: RA-SCIMAGE-TCP.
  
 The data in the MAIL GROUP field is mandatory and should have a 
 definition of: RAD HL7 MESSAGES
  
 Here is an example on how the entry may be set:
  
 NAME: RA-SCIMAGE-TCP                   ACTIVE/INACTIVE: ACTIVE
 FACILITY NAME: <your facility id here> MAIL GROUP: RAD HL7 MESSAGES
 COUNTRY CODE: USA                      HL7 ENCODING CHARACTERS: ^~\&
 HL7 FIELD SEPARATOR: |
  
 Note: We STRONGLY advise that the 'FACILITY NAME' field be populated. The
 'FACILITY NAME' field is a free text field. Traditionally sites have
 entered the facility name or station number when this field is edited.
  
  
 RA*5.0*84 exports the following protocols:
 ------------------------------------------ 
 RA SCIMAGE ORM                  Type: Subscriber                        
 RA SCIMAGE ORU                  Type: Subscriber                         
 RA SCIMAGE TCP REPORT           Type: Subscriber             
 RA SCIMAGE TCP SERVER RPT       Type: Event Driver
  
 Note: If your facility is not participating in the National 
 Teleradiology Project initiative do not associate the RA SCIMAGE 
 subscriber protocols to the radiology/nuclear medicine event 
 driver protocols. HL7 messaging will commence when the designated
 subscriber protocols are associated with their respective event driver
 protocols.
  
 Unnecessary HL7 messaging adds data to a facility's database and adds to
 network traffic.
  
 It is best to leave the task of linking the subscriber protocols to their
 event drivers for last.
  
 Subscriber Protocol: RA SCIMAGE TCP REPORT will be associated with the
 following RECEIVING APPLICATION: RA-VOICE-SERVER
  
 Event Driver Protocol: RA SCIMAGE TCP SERVER RPT will be associated
 with the following SENDING APPLICATION: RA-SCIMAGE-TCP
  
 RA*5.0*84 exports the following HL LOGICAL LINK component: RA-SCIMAGE. 
  
 RA*5.0*84 exports RA-SCIMAGE with predetermined data attributes defined: 
 LLP TYPE, TCP/IP SERVICE TYPE, etc  These fields are not to be edited. 
  
 The TCP/IP ADDRESS and TCP/IP PORT fields for RA-SCIMAGE will differ from 
 site to site. Because of this condition, these two fields are to be 
 configured by the appropriate parties at the facility where the patch is 
 being installed.
  
 Step One:
 ---------
 Here is an example of how to edit the TCP/IP ADDRESS and TCP/IP PORT 
 fields.
  
 Identify the correct menu to use in order to edit the TCP/IP ADDRESS and 
 TCP/IP PORT fields:

 Step Two:
 ---------
 RA-SCIMAGE must be associated with following subscriber protocols:
 * RA SCIMAGE ORM
 * RA SCIMAGE ORU
  
 VAxxx must be associated with following subscriber protocol:
 * RA SCIMAGE TCP REPORT
  
 To accomplish this action use the PROTOCOL EDIT option under the SELECT 
 INTERFACE DEVELOPER OPTIONS menu.
  
 The RA-SCIMAGE logical link is exported as a non-persistent client.
  
 Processes for non-persistent links hibernate when there are no more 
 messages to exchange over the link. When there are additional messages to 
 broadcast over this link, the TCP Link Manager process 'wakes up' the 
 logical link.
  
 To start the TCP Link Manager, use the TCP LINK MANAGER START/STOP 
 option under the HL MAIN MENU and HL MENU FILER LINK MGT menus.

 'VAxxx' is the name of the multi-threaded listener running at each VAMC 
 in the system. Each multi-threaded listener will have a unique IP address 
 but all multi-threaded listeners will have a port definition of 5000.
  
 How would one identify the proper name of the multi-threaded listener at 
 their facility? The best way is through the use of the VA FileMan SEARCH 
 function:

 Step Three:
 -----------
 The subscriber protocols can be associated with the event driver 
 protocols. HL7 messaging will commence when the designated subscriber
 protocols are associated with their respective event driver protocols.
  
 Subscriber Protocol: RA SCIMAGE ORM needs to be associated with the
 following event driver protocols: RA REG 2.3, RA EXAMINED 2.3, and RA
 CANCEL 2.3
  
 Subscriber Protocol: RA SCIMAGE ORU needs to be associated with the
 following event driver protocol: RA RPT 2.3
  
 Use the PROTOCOL EDIT option under the INTERFACE DEVELOPER OPTIONS and
 HL7 MAIN MENU menus to accomplish this task. Edit only the SUBSCRIBERS
 field; editing any other field may compromise the integrity of the event
 driver protocol.
  
 Here is an example of that process. I'll use RA REG 2.3 as an example. So 
 RA SCIMAGE ORM will be subscriber to RA REG 2.3, RA EXAMINED 2.3, and RA
 CANCEL 2.3. RA SCIMAGE ORU will be a subscriber to RA RPT 2.3.
  
 The process of adding a subscriber is the same regardless of the message
 type.
