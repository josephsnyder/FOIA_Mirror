Subject: VISTA IMAGING IMPORTER III RIS (RADIOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM) SUPPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Importer is an application on the DICOM (Digital Imaging and 
 Communication in Medicine) Image Gateway that can be used to transfer
 DICOM objects from studies performed outside of the VA into VistA Imaging.
 These DICOM objects may be transmitted directly from the outside facility
 to the VA, as in the case for the studies for the polytrauma patients, or
 they may be loaded from portable media (CDs or DVDs). Portable media must
 conform to the DICOM Standard and the Integrating the Healthcare
 Enterprise (IHE) Portable Data for Imaging (PDI) integration profile.
 (Unfortunately, some PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System)
 generate "DICOM" CDs and DVDs in proprietary formats that can't be
 processed by VistA Imaging - see Appendix D of the 'Imaging DICOM Gateway
 Importer User Manual' for examples.) Report files that are on the media
 will not process at this time but will be dealt with in a future patch.
  
 The Importer can also be used to correct and import locally acquired 
 DICOM objects that were rejected by VistA due to patient and/or study 
 identification information mismatch. This functionality replaces the 
 current DICOM Correct utility on workstations where the Importer software 
 is installed.
  
 This version of the Importer, the third, includes an enhancement to the 
 VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application (known as the Radiology
 Information System or 'RIS'). The RIS will now accept Secondary Diagnostic
 Codes and file exam specific secondary Dx Codes into the RAD/NUC MED
 PATIENT database.

 Installation Instructions: 
 =========================
 The patch can be installed with VistA RIS users online. The importation 
 of patient studies MUST be suspended while this patch is being installed.
  
 Installation time for this patch is less than five minutes.
  
  1. Use the "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" option of the Packman menu.
     This option loads the patch into a Transport Global on your

  2. Select the Installation submenu from the Kernel 
     Installation & Distribution System [XPD MAIN] menu.
  
  3. Verify integrity of the patch using the Verify 
     Checksums in Transport Global option [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM].
  
  4. Backup the routines exported with this patch using
     the Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] option.
  
  5. Optionally, use the following options:
  
     Print Transport Global [XPD PRINT INSTALL]
     Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM]
  
  6. Start the patch installation using the Install
     Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
  
  7. Answer NO to the following prompts:
  
     Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during install?  No//NO
     Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options and Protocols?  No//NO
