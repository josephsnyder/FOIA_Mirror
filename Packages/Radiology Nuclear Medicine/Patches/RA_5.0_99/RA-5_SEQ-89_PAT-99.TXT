  ************************************************************************
  
  
 Summary Verification Timeliness Report:
 The enhancement shall ensure that the "Summary Radiology Outpatient 
 Procedure Wait Time Report" and the "Summary Verification Timeliness 
 Report" are run automatically on the 15th of the following month of
 the quarter-end, for the previous quarter's data. This feature is
 described in detail in the Radiology User Manual.
  
  
 Pregnancy Status:
 This enhancement shall ensure that patient responses to the 
 technologists' screening question shall be captured in the VistA 
 Radiology/Nuclear Medicine 5.0 system; that the technologists can see the 
 pregnancy status entered at the time of order entry; and that either the 
 pregnancy status or pregnancy screen response is being communicated.
 These features are described in detail in the Radiology User Manual.
 Also, the Patient Safety Issue #PSI-05-113 which is related to pregnancy 
 status will be corrected by allowing the Radiology users to enter
 Pregnancy Screen and Pregnancy Screen Comment in Vista Radiology.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 =============================================================
 NSR 20070702
 CPRS allows entering pregnancy status at the time of order entry for 
 radiology studies. However, the radiology package does not allow 
 modifying the status of this field. Radiology staff asks pregnancy status 
 of all non-male patients, but they do not have a place to document the 
 answer (when different than what is listed with the radiology order) in a 
 coded manner that can get communicated to external systems. The OI 
 Patient Safety Workgroup noted this as a deficiency in the current VistA 
 Radiology package, and associated transmission of data to external 
 systems such as PACS. The OI Patient Safety Work Group recommends that 
 there be the ability to update the pregnancy status at the time of the 
 exam, while leaving a history of the pregnancy status at the time the 
 order was initiated. 
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ====================================================
 309290 
 346932
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 =============================
 309290
  
    Problem: "Backdoor" order entry: On the 'Request an Exam' menu option, 
 in order to populate the pregnancy status, you must edit the pregnancy 
 status in the same session in which you've entered the request. This is a 
 defect because the prompt should display while initially entering the 
 request (as opposed to having to go back and edit the request). Please 
 modify the code such that when a user is entering an exam request, insert 
 the 'PREGNANT AT TIME OF ORDER ENTRY:'  prompt. Allow the same 3 
 responses: YES, NO, UNKNOWN.
  
    Resolution: Modified routine RAORD1A and used the correct variable, 
 allowing the user to enter the Pregnancy status the first time the
 Radiology user enters an order, and replaced 'Pregnant' title to 'PREGNANT
 AT TIME OF ORDER ENTRY'
  
  
 346932 
  
    Problem: "Date Desired" prompt in Register Patient for Exam option
 should not be repeating if user answers "NO" to "Do you want to change
 any of the above".
  
    Resolution: Modifed RA Quick Exam Order and RA Order Exam input 
 template, removing the second "Date Desired" prompt if user answers "NO".

 Summary of changes to the Options (File #19):
 ==================================
 1. Summary Verification Timeliness Report - Changed subject of Outlook
 email from "Radiology Summary Verification Timeliness" to "Radiology
 Timeliness Performance Reports".  Inserted a header. Repeat header
 information from "Summary Verification Timeliness Report," without the

 Division: WASHINGTON
 Exam Date Range: 10/1/08 - 12/31/08

 For the next line on the "Summary Verification 
 Timeliness Report," insert the text:           
 Performance Value Summary
                         
 For the next line on the "Summary Verification Timeliness Report," 
 inserted the two new performance value summary values. The first 
 performance value summary is a single calculated value, the
 "Report verification timeliness performance value."  Calculation: 
 [%Vr Column 1 + %Vr Column 2]. Display percentage with one decimal.
 Display as: 
 92.4% - Report verification timeliness performance value
  
 The second performance value summary, "Wait Time Performance Values,"
 is a table, and is separated by Procedure Types.  List the percentage 
 values for each procedure type. The calculation is: print the 
 "DAYS WAIT - PERCENTAGES" partial table from the "Summary Radiology
 Outpatient Procedure Wait Time" report. Include the headers, procedure
 type labels, and percentage values with the decimal point to the tenth 
 place (.0) from the ' <=14 days and <=30 days' column. Display the table

 The "<=14 Days" column contains data that is also in the "<=30 Days"
 column. The reason that performance is calculated for both <=14 days
 and <=30 days is so that facilities can track their performance to a
 14 day performance standard rather than a 30 day standard if they
 choose to do so.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 The install time for this patch should take less than 5 minutes. Because 
 this patch affects exam status calculation, all Radiology users must be 
 off the system during the installation. And since an input template is
 being re-compiled, it is best if this patch is installed outside of normal
 working hours.
  
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  
  1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
   
  2. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
  
     - Backup a Transport Global - this option creates a backup message 
 of any routines exported with the patch. It does NOT backup any other 
 changes, such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
     - Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option allows 
 you to view all changes that are made when the patch is installed. It 
 compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
     -  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option allows you to 
 ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport global.
   
  3. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
  
         When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*99.
  
         When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees upon 
         Completion of Install? YES//", respond YES

         NO//", respond YES.
   
         When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? YES//", respond YES.
