 Problem A:
 ----------
 Error <UNDEFINED>FAILBUL+6^RAPCE2 logged when processing addendums from 
 HL7. RADUZ and DUZ are not set.
  
 Resolution A:
 ------------- 
 RADUZ is killed during amendment processing of the report and needed 
 again, down the line for exam status log updates and PCE crediting.  RADUZ
 will be re-set to be to ensure its availability down the line.  
 Additionally, reliance on DUZ is not advisable. The PCE Credit Failure 
 bulletin routine RAPCE2 will use .5 for POSTMASTER if RADUZ and DUZ are 
 not set.
  
 Problem B:
 ----------
 The National Radiology Program Office (NRPO) has released several 
 additional standardized CANCEL/HOLD reasons for field distribution.
  
 Resolution B:
 -------------
 A post-init routine will update the RAD/NUC MED REASON file (#75.2) with 
 the following new CANCEL and HOLD reasons.  Note that reason "OTHER" was 
 previously a CANCEL reason only.  This patch updates it to General so it
 can also be used for held requests.

 Backout/Roll-back Strategy:
 ===========================
  
  Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
  development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision
  to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
  development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
  personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
  any backout procedures.
  
  Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
  install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded
  with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
  Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
  backed up routines onto the VistA System.
