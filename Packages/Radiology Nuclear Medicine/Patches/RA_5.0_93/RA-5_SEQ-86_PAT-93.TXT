Subject: INCOMPLETE EXM REP PRT ISSUE, ALERT TEXT CHG, DIK CALL CHG, LOCK TIMEOUT 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following 4 issues:
      
 1.  When printing the Radiology Incomplete Exam Report, the OUPATIENT
     heading sometimes prints on inpatients.
  
 2.  A FileMan call in a Radiology routine needs to be restructured to
     better conform to Standards & Conventions Committee (SACC) standards.
     
 3.  In the ORDER ENTRY package (OERR), the names of 2 Radiology Alert
     Parameters are being changed, necessitating the same changes in the
     RADIOLOGY/NUCLEAR MEDICINE (RA) package.
  
 4.  Due to a recent update to the SACC standards, modifications need to 
     be made to some routines to include a lock timeout parameter.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000246868 Problem with report
   
     Problem:
     --------
     When printing the Radiology Incomplete Exam Report [RA INCOMPLETE],
     the heading, *** OUTPATIENT ***, will sometimes print incorrectly 
     on Inpatients. 
   
     Resolution :
     ------------
     Modified routine RADLQ3 to only print the *** OUTPATIENT *** heading
     when the routine encounters the first outpatient of the report print
     or new page after that.
       
  
 2.  HD0000000249750 Bad DIK syntax in 4 routines
   
     Problem:
     --------
     4 Radiology routines are making FileMan DIK calls in violation of 
     SACC standards.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routines RAEDCN1, RAREG1, RAREG2, and RARIC1 have been modified
     to set the DIK variable according to FileMan guidelines.
     This change does not affect functionality will be completely 
     transparent to users.
   
 3.  HD0000000257549 Modification request for alert text
      
     Problem:
     --------
     In the Order Entry package (OERR 3.0), the names of 2 Radiology
     Alert Parameters are being changed.  The same changes need to be made 
     for the Radiology package. 
      
     From:                            To:
     (22) Imaging Results:            (22) Imaging Results, Non Critical:
     (25) Abnormal Imaging Results:   (25) Abnl Imaging Reslt, Needs Attn:
      
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modifications will be made in routine RAUTL00 to reflect the alert
     parameter name changes in the Radiology alerts.
       
  
 4.  HD0000000273494 Record Lock Timeout needed
      
     Problem:
     --------
     SACC standards were recently updated to require every record lock to 
     have a timeout parameter.  During review of this patch, one routine
     was found to not have the newly required timeout parameter.
            
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine RAREG1 will have the necessary lock timeout parameter added. 
     This change does not affect functionality will be completely 
     transparent to users.
