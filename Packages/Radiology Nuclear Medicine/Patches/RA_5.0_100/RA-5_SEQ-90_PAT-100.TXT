Subject: CORRECT THE RA REPORT EDIT TEMPLATE

Category: 
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the issue of occasionally having an incorrect 
 Verifying Physician display on a Radiology Report.

 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000249983 VERIFIED BY field is another radiologist
        
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 Occasionally, when a user is verifying a Radiology report, an incorrect
 name will be displayed on the report as the Verifier.  This happens when a
 non-involved user has data in the New Person file (#200) that corresponds 
 to the unique record identifier of the user verifying the report.
  
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 A modification will be made to the RA REPORT EDIT template so that the 
 correct identity of the verifying physician is displayed when the user 
 executes the option, SELECT REPORT TO PRINT BY PATIENT.  
  
 SPECIAL NOTE:
 =============
 The RA VERIFY REPORT ONLY template is being included in this patch with
 the same modification that was made to the RA REPORT EDIT template to
 maintain coding consistency. There have been no reported problems with the
 RA VERIFY REPORT ONLY template.
            
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
 The RA REPORT EDIT template uses a FILEMAN 3 slash stuff
 (///) to add/update the VERIFYING PHYSICIAN FIELD (#9)  
 in the RAD/NUC REPORT FILE (#74).  This FILEMAN data stuff 
 uses cross references for lookups in the NEW PERSON FILE (#200) 
 when performing a lookup utilizing a 3 slash stuff.  Occasionally,
 FILEMAN locates a cross reference using the VERIFYING 
 PHYSICIAN IEN that is cross referenced to a different Physician.
 Examples:
 VERIFYING PHYSICIAN IEN is equal to the Last 4 of SSN number 
 of a cross referenced physician.
 VERIFYING PHYSICIAN IEN is equal to the VA# of a cross 
 referenced physician.
  
 A modification will be made to the RA REPORT EDIT template to
 force FILEMAN to correctly identify the verifying physician by 
 adding an accent grave "`" to the variable being used to set the data.
 This forces FILEMAN to do a number lookup and identifies the 
 correct entry in the NEW PERSON FILE without using the cross references.
