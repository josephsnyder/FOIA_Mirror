Subject: Retiring Police Package Options

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Background:
  
 All VAMCs are up and operational in VAPS (VA Police and Security)
 Package.  The old software will be shut down by VISN. VAPS is a new
 windows based program.  It allows a national Database that can be accessed
 by any VA Police Officer.  It makes information available for a person
 that may have been a problem at another VA 2000 miles away.
  
 For more information about VAPS please contact the National VAPS Program
 Manager.
  
  
 This patch places 72 out of the 128 Police package options out of order.
 The options are ones that can change information in the legacy Police
 package files.  Read-only options are left active for historical data
 retrieval.  An environment check verifies that the Police package is
 installed in your system, and the post-install also removes Write, Delete,
 and Laygo access from all users for files in the 910-916 number range.
  
 You will see the following message if the Police package is not
 installed:
  
 Aborting install - Police package not present!
