 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC0000000205208 - ISP-DBaer Email fails w/XMDUZ=application proxy
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 If a mail message is triggered by a non-human user (i.e. Application 
 Proxy) the message fails to transmit due to problems encountered while
 populating the "From" value for the message.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine XMXPARM was modified to remove incorrect validation logic which
 allows messages to transmit that were triggered by non-human users.
  
   
 2) INC0000000362732 - IFCAP Message Router Errors - 10000 node missing
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Sites are encountering problems with the delivery of Financial Management
 Systems (FMS) messages through the PRCOFMS server due to timing issues
 with the processing routine.  Different parts of the messages are coming
 in at delayed intervals and the delay of some message lines are causing
 the processing to quit.
    
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine XMDTO was modified to attempt to sync mail message arrival with
 processing by building in up to a 5 minute pause and waiting for the next
 mail message line to arrive. If not, then Mailman will send error server
 message.
  
   
 3) INC0000000705881 - Testing Cache 2011 - Compile Errors
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Routines XML1CRC, XML4CRC, XML4CRC1, XMLSWP and XMLSWP0 are receiving a
 syntax error upon compiling. The syntax error is on the $ZC command.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routines XML1CRC, XML4CRC, XML4CRC1, XMLSWP and XMLSWP0 will be altered so
 that there will be no syntax error when trying to compile the routine that
 has multiple subscripts on $ZC. An execute statement will be added in
 front of the SET statement. By doing this, this will eliminate any syntax
 errors and it will not have an adverse effect on the logic.
