Subject: DSS FY 2014 SUSTAINMENT UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 During the release of the DSS FY 14 Sustainment patch ECX*3*144, it was
 discovered that two routines, ECXLARPT and ECXUPRO had incorrect dates
 listed on line two of the routine.  Typically, the second line of the
 routine contains the version release date for the package.  For these two
 routines that date was incorrect.
  
 A full review of all ECX routines was done and 6 additional routines were
 found to have an incorrect date on line two.  They are: ECXAMTL, 
 ECXUCBOC, ECXUCPT, ECXUDRF, ECXUEC, and ECXUSUR.
  
 In addition, during review, routines ECXLARPT and ECXUDRF were found to 
 have the package name listed as DSS instead of the correct formal name of 
 DSS EXTRACTS.
  
 It was also discovered that two fields in the BCMA EXTRACT (#727.833) 
 file, COMPONENT UNITS (#32) and COMPONENT DOSE GIVEN (#31), have become
 purely numeric where in the past they could have included numbers and
 text.  The text has meaning and will be returned to these fields.
  
 Problem #1: Package release date is incorrect on second line of routine
  
   ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
   ==================
   N/A 
   
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   --------
   On line 2 of the 8 routines listed above, the package release date was
   incorrect.  The package release date for version 3 of the DSS EXTRACT
   software was Dec 22, 1997.
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
   For each of the routines in question, the second line release date was 
   changed to Dec 22, 1997.
  
 Problem #2: The package name on line two was incorrectly identifed as
             DSS
  
   ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
   ==================
   N/A
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:
   --------
   On line 2 of routines ECXLARPT and ECXUDRF the package was identified 
   as DSS instead of DSS EXTRACTS.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The second line of the routines identified above were changed to 
   indicate DSS EXTRACTS, which is the formal name of the package.
    
 Problem #3: The COMPONENT UNITS (#32) field and the COMPONENT DOSE GIVEN
             (#31) field in the BCMA EXTRACT (#727.833) file have lost the
             unit portion of the field.
  
   ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
   ==================
   N/A
    
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
   
   Problem:  
   --------
   When calculating the cost related fields for the BCMA extract, the 
   COMPONENT DOSE GIVEN (#31) and COMPONENT UNIT (#32) fields were
   converted to numeric for the calculation.  Unfortunately, the units were
   not added back to those fields before they were stored as part of the
   extract record.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Before storing the extract record, the COMPONENT UNIT (#32) and
   COMPONENT DOSE GIVEN (#31) fields will be restored to their source
   values so that it includes all pertinent information.  Routine ECXBCM
   has been updated to correct the data in the above mentioned fields.
  
 Test Sites:
