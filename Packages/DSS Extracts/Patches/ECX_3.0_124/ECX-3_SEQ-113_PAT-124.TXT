Associated patches: (v)ECX*3*120   <<= must be installed BEFORE `ECX*3*124'

Subject: UPDATES DSS TO USE A QUASAR API

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following problems:
  
 1) The patch will make an update to the QUASAR Extract (ECXQSR) so users 
 will no longer receive a system error while running the ECQ (Quasar 
 Extract) option.
  
 2) This patch will correct a problem when transmitting extracts using the 
 Extract Files [ECXTRANS] option.
  
 ***This is a combined patch with patch ACKQ*3*17.  Both patches will be 
 loaded into your system when the combined host file ACKQ_17_ECX_124.KID 
 is loaded. The patches are combined due to the fact that the ECX 
 application retrieves data from the ACKQ application. The change that is 
 being made in the ACKQ patch will affect the ECX application.  It is 
 imperative that both patches are installed at the same time to prevent 
 error. Combining these patches will ensure both patches are installed 
 together.***

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000332321 - <UNDEFINED>UPDATE+87^ECXQSR +4
  
 Problem:
 --------
 DSS is making an incorrect read of a QUASAR global.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 DSS is going to use an API to read the necessary information from QUASAR
 An integration agreement (DBIA# 5494) has been created to support this read.  
  
 2. HD0000000373348 - Site experienced trouble transmitting CLI extract.
 Problem:
 --------
 A site transmitted 2009 data for the Clinic (CLI) extract after installing 
 the FY 2010 update (ECX*3.0*120).  Austin rejected the transmission because
 the data had an extra "^" appended to it.  This "^" is necessary for the 
 2010 data.  
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 The transmission has been modified not to append the "^" to the 2009 data.

          a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
              you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
              transport global.
          b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
              the components of the KIDS build.
