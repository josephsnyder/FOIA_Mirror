Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 -This patch is to change where the Nutrition Extract gathers the Inpatient
 Location.  Currently, the extract uses information from the NUTRITION 
 PERSON file (#115).  After the installation of this patch, the extract 
 will use the information from the PATIENT MOVEMENT file (#405).
  
 -When printing the DETAILED AUDIT REPORT for INPATIENTs using 'Nutrition 
 (NUT) Extract Audit' [ECX NUT SOURCE AUDIT] menu, the report will no 
 longer display an UNK for fields if there are no values expected.  The 
 UNK or UNKNOWN will only be used to let the user know fields are missing
 in the DSS Worksheets.  N/A will be used when no values are expected.  See
 example below.

 -When printing 'Print Nutrition Division Worksheet' [ECX NUT DIV PRINT] 
 report, two additional sections will print giving the user information 
 missing from the DSS Worksheets.  The additional sections will print after
 the 'PRODUCTION LOCATIONS' and the 'DELIVERY LOCATIONS' sections.  Example
 below.   For NUT EXTRACT to run accurately, this report needs to be clean
 and complete with no items left under the missing PRODUCTION or DELIVERY
 LOCATIONS sections.  This report can be run anytime and multiple times.  
 The Nutrition Worksheets have to be correct PRIOR to running the NUT
 EXTRACT ----- EACH MONTH ----THIS IS NOT A ONE TIME SETUP!

 -When printing 'Print Nutrition Product Worksheet' [ECX NUT PRO PRINT]

 missing diet section of the Nutrition Product Worksheet Report.  For 
 NUT EXTRACT to run accurately, this report needs to be clean and complete 
 with no items left under the missing diet section.  This report can be
