 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1) HD0000000367681 - Unable To Add National Code
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A.) If there are duplicates codes in the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file,
 CLINICS AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file cannot be updated using the
 Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option.
 B.) The DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics Report is also getting
 invalid data for duplicate codes.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 A.) Routines ECXSCLD and ECXSTOP have been changed to use IEN (Internal 
 Entry Number) for lookup instead of AMIS (Automated Management 
 Information System) code and set up an array to look for active or 
 inactive codes if there is more than one code.
  
 B.) Code has been changed in routine ECXSCRP to make it look for an
 active stop code.
  
  
  
 2) HD0000000384504 - No longer able to edit credit stop code assignment 
 using "Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics  [ECXSCEDIT] " 
  
 Problem:
 =======
 Code allows entry of same DSS Stop Code and DSS Credit Stop Code in 
 Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option.
 If user then goes to change the DSS Credit Stop Code, the software does
 not allow user to pass the DSS stop Code field and user is unable to get
 to the DSS Credit Stop Code to change.
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Routine ECXSCLD has been changed to verify DSS Stop Code and DSS Credit 
 Stop Code before filing the record. If any errors are found, a
 message will display and user will be able to correct the record before 
 submitting.
