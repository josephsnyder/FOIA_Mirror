 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =================
 HD0000000256021:        LAB tests to add for FY09 Request
  
  Problem:
  --------
  A request was made to update the VistA DSS LAB TESTS (#727.2) file
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
   The changes were submitted by the Bedford Technical Support Office
   (BTSO) Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office to be implemented
   upon release of the patch.  This patch updates the DSS LAB TESTS
   (#727.2) file by adding 5 new lab test records.
  
   Resolution Detail:
  
   (1) The new entries that will be added to file #727.2 are:
  
      RESULTS ID#      Description                          Source Code
      -----------      -----------                          -----------
      72               PHOSPHATE (SERUM)                    BLOOD
      73               CEA (SERUM)                          BLOOD
      74               PRO B NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE            BLOOD
      75               PHOSPHATE (SERUM)_PRE DIAL           BLOOD
      76               PHOSPHATE (SERUM)_POST DIAL          BLOOD
     
    NOTES:
    ------
     This DSS patch will add tests for Lab Results (LAR) and can
     be added to VistA any time before the LAR extract is run for
     October 2008.
     HOWEVER, these new tests should NOT be "linked" to the site's LMIP
     codes (linking is done after the patch is installed and implemented)
     until after the site's LAR extract has been run for September 2008.
  
     Use the Link DSS Selected Lab Tests to Local Lab Tests option
     [ECXLABRS] to associate each of the new lab entries with a local
     Laboratory test.  This will enable test results to be extracted
     in the Laboratory Results (LAR) extract.
