Subject: DSS FY 2011 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 **NOTE** The DSS (Decision Support System) FY (Fiscal Year) updates include 
 changes to the lab package to support this year's changes.  Patch LR*5.2*403 
 should be installed just before installing this patch.
  
 The DSS FY11 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to a DSS 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 Included in the DSS FY11 scope are: 
      o       DSS Extract field additions and modifications
      o       DSS menu additions, modifications and deletions
      o       New DSS reports and report modifications
      o       Implementation of the new and/or deleted extracts
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.
  
 Not included are the modifications to the AITC DSS software, the AITC 
 legacy extracts, and Vendor software.

 33.  Modify "Enter/Edit DSS WARD" [ECX WARD DSSDEPT] menu option.
  
 For item number 1, please note the following.  The ENCOUNTER SHAD field is
 being added to a number of extracts this year.  For the ADM extract, there
 is a new field ENCOUNTER SHAD (#55) being added to the ADMISSION EXTRACT
 FILE (#727.802).  During internal testing it was noted that the PATIENT
 MOVEMENT file (#405) does not have the VISIT FILE ENTRY field (#.27)
 populated.  The encounter SHAD information is obtained from this link and
 without it, no SHAD data is being returned.  For FY11, expect the
 ENCOUNTER SHAD field for the ADM extract to be blank.  Remedy ticket
 HD0000000433281 has been opened to investigate the reason for the missing
 data.
  
 Also for item number 1, the ENCOUNTER SHAD (#89) field is being added to 
 the PROSTHETICS EXTRACT FILE (#727.826).  During internal testing it was 
 noted that the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR FILE (#660) does not have 
 the PCE (#8.12) field populated.  The encounter SHAD information is 
 obtained from this link and without it, no encounter SHAD data is being 
 returned.  Upon investigation, it was noted that the link between the 
 prosthetics file and the visit file was intentionally removed in patch 
 RMPR*3*145.  For FY11, expect the ENCOUNTER SHAD field for the PRO 
 extract to be blank.
  
 For item number 5, Add new BCMA (BCM) Extract, the coding for this extract
 is being distributed in this patch, however, the option will be locked as
 sites are not to run this extract as it will be in testing during FY11.  
 Your site may be contacted by the Decision Support Office during FY11
 regarding testing of this extract.  At that time, you'll be instructed on
 how to proceed with running this extract.
  
 A new mail group DSS-BCM has been created for the purpose of receiving 
 messages after the above BCM extract has been run and when data will
 eventually be transmitted to the AAC. During the installation of the 
 patch (as listed below in the installation instructions step 4.c) a prompt
 will appear asking for the coordinator of this group. The default will be
 the person installing the patch, you may change this to the DSS Site
 Manager. After installation, others deemed appropriate by the DSS Site
 Manager, can be added to this new DSS mail group.
  
 A change was made to correctly handle the marking of an extract as 
 "inactive".  If the INACTIVE field (#13) of the EXTRACT DEFINITION file 
 (#727.1) is marked "YES", indicating the extract is inactive, any attempt 
 to run this extract will be denied. The user will receive a message
 indicating that the extract is currently inactivated.
  
 In addition to the MTL and PAS extracts being marked as inactive, the DEN 
 extract will also be marked as inactive.  These updates will occur during 
 the post-install and will change the INACTIVE field (#13) of the EXTRACT 
 DEFINITION file (#727.1) to "YES", indicating they are inactive.
