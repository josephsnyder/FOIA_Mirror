 During the release of the DSS FY 20 Sustainment patch ECX*3*174, it was
 discovered that certain prosthetics post-extract audit reports were 
 not using the new prosthetics cost related fields.  The prosthetics cost 
 related information was moved to new fields to accommodate larger dollar 
 amounts.  The new fields were not used when displaying costs on certain 
 prosthetic reports.
  
 Problem #1: New cost fields not used on reports that include cost 
 information.

   Problem:  
   --------

   information:
        o Prosthetics (PRO) YTD HCPCS Report
        o Prosthetics (PRO) YTD Laboratory Report
        o Prosthetics (PRO) Extract Audit Report (both summary and 
          detailed)
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Changes were made in the reporting code so that the new cost fields were
   used in the reports mentioned above.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Boston
