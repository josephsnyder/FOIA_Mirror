Subject: Release of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Version 2.0
 
 
Release Information:
 
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) 2.0 is new software which will provide the 
ability to track TBI screening and follow-up evaluations for the 
population of Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi 
Freedom (OEF/OIF). This software replaces an interim solution at the VHA 
Service Support Center (VSSC). The TBI Registry uses the Converged 
Registries platform which provides the long-term enterprise solution for 
registries.  VA began receiving increasing numbers of OEF/OIF TBI injured 
Veterans beginning in 2003 and the numbers continue to expand. With this 
expansion there has been a need to track and monitor the care of the TBI 
population. The users of the TBI Registry will be the Patient Care 
Services Rehabilitation Program Office staff. The software provides tools 
to track the screening and follow-up evaluations being performed at 
facilities throughout VHA. Being part of the Converged Registries 
platform also allows for use of data extracts from a variety of data 
systems including VistA/CPRS and the Corporate Data Warehouse. A web 
interface is used to enter the follow up evaluations (as it is currently 
with the interim VSSC solution). Users will be positively impacted as 
they will have a tool to aggregate TBI data nationally for the registry 
and to produce reports requested by VHA management.
 
Impacts to Healthcare  


The goal is for the registry to support performance monitoring and 
improvement of VHA TBI screening and Comprehensive TBI Evaluations for 
OEF/OIF Veterans.
 
The TBI Instruments writes notes back to CPRS using MDWS (Medical Domain 
Web Services).  The TBI Instruments/Tools are accessed via a web link 
which is placed on the CPRS Tools menu.
TBI requests patient data from MDWS; MDWS retrieves the data from CPRS 
where it is stored as a progress note in the Text Integration Utilities 
(TIU).  TBI instruments are completed and written back to MDWS; MDW 
writes the completed information to CPRS.
Note: this process is similar to the existing VSSC interim solution- the 
new web link on the CPRS Tools menu will replace the existing web link 
which accesses the VSSC application. 
  
 
 
Training 


Separate training sessions for IRM and users will be offered to each 
facility in a series of Live Meeting conference calls on the VANTS 
Bridge. These calls are being organized by Douglas Bidelspach, 
Rehabilitation Planning Specialist, Office of Patient Care Services.
 
Sites should not begin using the new URL address until this training has 
been attended.
The live meetings will be recorded and archived and can be retrieved as 
needed for new employees that transition into the program areas.
