Two sites have reported  the following issues:
1. Intravenous piggyback orders with odd schedules may print labels every 
day, instead of when labels should print in accordance with the 
schedule.  This printing of extra labels may result in  extra work load 
to cancel the unwanted labels and/or the potential to manufacture an 
unwanted label and administering it to the patient
 
2. Under certain circumstances an incorrect Dose Due date/time will print 
on the IV label.
 
 
A follow-up patch will be created to address the issues identified in 
PSJ*5*272.  The estimate date of release and patch name designation is to 
be determined.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
