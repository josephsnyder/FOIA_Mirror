Release Information:
 
We are pleased to announce the release of the Medication Order Check 
Healthcare Application Server (MOCHA) Server (MS) v1.1.01. The purpose of 
this software product release is to replace the current version, MS 
v1.1.00.014, with an enhanced version, MS v1.1.01.1420, which addressed 
one item: 1) Remedy ticket HD0000000714365 - introduces two new med 
routes 112 - PERCUTANEOUS and 113 - CONTINUOUS INFILTRATION
 
The MOCHA Server conducts medication order checks using First Databank's 
(FDB) MedKnowledge Framework (formerly Drug Information Framework (DIF)) 
within the existing VistA Pharmacy application. FDB is a data product 
that provides the latest identification and safety information on 
medications. Additionally, FDB provides the latest algorithms used to 
perform order checks. MOCHA Server provides an interface between the 
requesting order check systems and the FDB MedKnowledge Framework, first 
requesting the order check from FDB MedKnowledge and then returning the 
results to the requesting systems.
