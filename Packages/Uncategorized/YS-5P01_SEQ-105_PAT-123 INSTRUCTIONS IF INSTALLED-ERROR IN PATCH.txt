-----------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have not installed YS*5.01*123, please do not install it until 
further notice.  The compliance date will be extended.  A number of sites 
are seeing errors when indexes in some of the Mental Health files have 
erroneous entries.  An emergency patch is being created that will 
re-index the files that are involved.  Once the files are re-indexed, the 
errors should no longer occur.
 
If you have already installed YS*5.01*123, there are two options:
  1) Wait for the patch that will re-index the files.
  2) Re-index the "AC" index of the files involved.  The instructions are 
below.  If you have any questions about re-indexing files, please contact 
OIT HPS.
 
 
Re-indexing files needs to be done after hours, when there is VERY LOW USE
of mental health instruments, as the indexes are deleted before they are 
rebuilt.
 
The files that need to be re-indexed are:
  MH RESULTS (601.92)   AC cross-reference
  MH ANSWERS (601.85)   AC index (new style)
 
 
Examples of re-indexing the appropriate indexes are below:
