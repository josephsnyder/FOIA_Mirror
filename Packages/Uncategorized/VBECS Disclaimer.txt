Disclaimer: The FOIA version of VBECS and VistA Imaging being distributed 
has been redacted to remove proprietary and security components.  These 
products involve medical devices and as a result the VA had to obtain a 
510K clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to 
placing these products into production in the VA medical facilities. This 
approval only applies for the VA and does not carry over to sources 
outside of VA. If you elect to use these products, it’s your 
responsibility to obtain the 510K clearance and meet the FDA 
requirements.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is in no way liable for 
any use of this code.


This disclaimer was first put on the FOIA site, November 2012.
