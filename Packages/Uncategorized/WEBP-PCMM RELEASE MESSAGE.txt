The PATIENT-CENTERED MANAGEMENT MODULE (PCMM) WEB package is available for
user selection as part of the patch module. The package prefix is 'WEBP'
and the description of the package is as follows:
 
Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application.
 
PCMM Web is a portlet that runs inside the Clinical Information Support 
System (CISS) portal.  The Clinical Information Support System (CISS) is 
a web-based portal application that provides a central interface for 
users to access information and applications necessary for their role. 
The applications accessed through CISS are called partner systems.  PCMM 
Web is a partner system to CISS.
 
In order to fully support a team based, patient-centric approach to 
healthcare delivery, enhancements to PCMM have been developed which allow 
a team to be formed and aligned around a patient. These, include 
providers residing in multiple VA sites and in non-VA settings to enable 
care coordination and communication.   The software supports automated 
data collection for management metrics and analysis related to access, 
workload, and panel management.  VHA's model of team-based care is known 
as the Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT).  The goal is to evolve and 
replace existing PCMM software with functionality that identifies all 
team members and specialists (VA and non-VA) involved in the care of the 
patient, as well as their contact information and provide modalities to 
facilitate provider-provider communication.  This new PACT Management 
Module is known as PCMM Web.  According to the PCMM Modification 
Workgroup, the relationship between the patient and his/her Primary Care 
Provider (PCP) will help to enhance patient care and the treatment 
process.  Patients who regularly visit the same PCP receive better 
healthcare and utilize fewer healthcare resources because of the PCP's 
ability to treat patients more efficiently and effectively.
 
There are three VistA patches associated with release of PCMM Web.  These 
patches are required and support PCMM Web interactions with VistA and
