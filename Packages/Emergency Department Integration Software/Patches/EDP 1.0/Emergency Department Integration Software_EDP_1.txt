-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Emergency Department Integration Software (EDIS) team is pleased to 
announce the release of EDIS version 1.0.  EDIS offers an open-view 
digital log of critical activities in the Emergency Department. It 
produces a display of all active patients in the department as well as 
their location, status, and provider. The information may be displayed on 
any computer with server access via a web browser and/or on a big screen 
display centrally located in the emergency department. This updates and 
replaces the manual white board still found in many emergency departments.
 
EDIS incorporates several web-based views that extend the current 
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to help staff track and manage 
patient flow and patient care. EDIS offers a team-view of department 
status instead of the first-person view (one patient at a time for one 
user) common to CPRS.
 
EDIS is based on a Class III application developed by the Upstate New 
York Veterans Health Care Network (VISN 2). EDIS is distinguished by 
major modifications- specifically new features for performance and 
stability, stronger security, accessibility (508 compliance), and user 
pleasing screen enhancements. 
 
The features and functionality included in this release are:
 
  -  Add emergency-department patients to the applications display board
 
  -  View information about patients on the display board 
 
  -  Edit patient information 
 
  -  Remove patients from the display board 
 
  -  Views for entering patients dispositions 
 
  -  Configuring the display board
 
  -  Create administrative and operational reports 
 
  -  Supports assistive reading technologies such as Job Access with 
     Speech (JAWS) for accessibility
 
The software will be a phased release.  The EDIS Implementation Team will 
contact sites prior to installation so they can complete several 
pre-install steps.  Sites should not install the EDIS 1.0 software until 
the checklist has been completed and verified by the EDIS Implementation 
Team.
 
SOFTWARE CHANGES:
 
This web-based application is on its initial release. No changes were 
made to any existing software.  EDIS will use the EDP namespace.

INSTALLATION:
 
The software will be available for installation/ implementation upon 
completion and verification of the pre-install checklist that will be 
distributed in phases by the Implementation Team. Users will be set up on 
the National Server for EDIS access based on the implementation 
schedule.  Upon setup and access to the National Server, sites will be 
able to test and then move into production. 
 
The Implementation Team information can be found at:
 
http://vaww.oed.portal.va.gov/projects/edis_v1/default.aspx
 
 
The VistA portion of this installation should take less than 10 minutes. 
The build should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption 
to users. Users may be on the system during installation of these 
packages.  See the Installation Guide for complete installation and 
implementation instructions.
 
Time to configure the application parameters will vary by site depending 
on site preparation.  Once the training and configuration worksheet are 
complete, configuration could take several hours.
