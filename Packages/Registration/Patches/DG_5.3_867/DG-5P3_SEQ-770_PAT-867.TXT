Description:
============

                            ***NOTICE***
 Users should be made aware that processing of Newborn claims must ONLY be
 entered in VistA. No entry in FBCS should be performed.
                            ***********
 This patch, along with FB*3.5*146 and IB*2.0*499, is being released as a
 bundle, and all three will be automatically installed in the correct order.
 
 
 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Patient 
 Registration system (DG), Fee Basis System (FB), and Integrated Billing 
 (IB).
 
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
 their patch number:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
  PATIENT REGISTRATION (DG) V 5.3                       DG*5.3*867
  FEE BASIS (FB) V 3.5                                  FB*3.5*146
  INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) 2.0                           IB*2.0*499
 
 The patches (DG*5.3*867, FB*3.5*146, and IB*2.0*499) are being released in the
 Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build distribution
 NEWBORN DG FB IB BUNDLE 1.0
 
 The purpose of the Caregivers: Newborn Claims Processing Enhancement Project 
 is to enhance VistA Fee Basis application in support of compliance with 
 Public Law 111-163, the Caregiver and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act 
 of 2010. This law makes changes to sections of Title 38, United States Code 
 to furnish health care services to a newborn child of a Woman Veteran who 
 is receiving maternity care furnished by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
 (VA) for not more than seven days after the birth of the child.
 
 The scope of these enhancements is to capture information on healthcare
 services provided to newborn children of Women Veterans. Affected functions
 include eligibility determination, enrollment and registration, documentation
 of referrals and authorization for care, claims processing, and payment. Only
 modification to the Fee Basis (FB) and the Registration (DG) packages are
 necessary to meet the requirements of this enhancement. The Integrated 
 Billing (IB) Patch is included to provide required data for the Fee Basis 
 install to reference.
 
 
 The primary purpose of this enhancement is to allow the Electronic Filing of
 Newborn claims.
 
 Functional Description
 ------------------------------
 The following features and functions have been added to the Fee Basis workflow
 process applying to both Civil Hospital and Medical Fee:
 
  1. A new Patient Type of NEWBORN OF VETERAN has been added to the TYPE OF
 PATIENT file (#391). This new selection will be available on Registration
 Screen <7>.
 
  2. A sponsor is required for all Newborns determined by having the DOB less
 than one (1) year from the present date. An inconsistency check has been added
 to check the presence of a sponsor. If an inconsistency is found the
 inconsistency check will prompt the user to return to Screen <15> in
 registration to enter a Sponsor.
 
  3. All Sponsors for Newborns must be listed as eligible for care. An
 inconsistency check will check the status of the Sponsors Eligibility. The
 check will trigger if the Sponsor has no Eligibility status.
 
 All other statuses (i.e. Pending Verification, Verified, and Pending
 Re-verification) are acceptable.
 
  4. Fee Authorization dates associated with Newborns have checks in place to
 not allow Authorization dates that fall outside the accepted range of Newborn 
 Authorization. The range is DOB to DOB+7. The system will warn the user and 
 not accept an Authorization date that falls outside the appropriate range for 
 a Newborn.
 
  5. When a Veteran Mother of a Sponsored Newborn is reviewed in the
 Registration screens, Screen <15> will display the Newborn(s), with the
 additional header of "Sponsored Newborn".
 
  6. The FAMILY PREFIX "NB Newborn of Vet" has been added to the Help text in
 the FAMILY PREFIX field (#.03) in the SPONSOR RELATIONSHIP file (#355.81)
 
  7. "NON-VA FOR FEMALE VET+NEWBORN 17.38" was added to the VA ADMITTING
 REGULATION file (#43.4). This new Admitting Regulation is available when
 editing the 7078.
 
  8. The following default values were added when entering a Newborn with a 
 date of birth of less than one (1) year from present date. Defaults will 
 only be assigned when specified screens are accessed during the registration 
 process: PATIENT DATA, SCREEN <2> Marital field is defaulted to NEVER 
 MARRIED. APPLICANT/SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT DATA, SCREEN <4> Status field is 
 defaulted to NOT EMPLOYED. FAMILY DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, SCREEN <8> Married 
 Last Year field is defaulted to NO.

  Patch Installation:
 
 
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There are three post installation routines associated with this patch DG867PO,
 FB146PO, and IB499PO. These routines primarily serve as filters for the data
 transmitted to the appropriate files listed above, so that only the intended
 data is delivered. The only exception is the IB499PO routine which
 programmatically makes an addition to the help text of the FAMILY PREFIX field
 (#.03) in the SPONSOR RELATIONSHIP file (#355.81). These post installation
 routines may be deleted after successful installation of the NEWBORN DG FB IB
 BUNDLE 1.0
