Description:
============

  DG*5.3*800 is a required build for patch DG*5.3*821.
   
  The James A Lovell joint VA/Department of Defense (DoD) Medical Center
  in North Chicago is projected to open on 10/01/2010.  The following
  changes are made in VistA to support that effort.
    
  Issue #1
  The SOURCE ID (#20) multiple has been added to the TREATING FACILITY
  LIST (#391.91) file on VistA.  The SOURCE ID (#.01) and IDENTIFIER
  STATUS (#1) fields are updated by a Treating Facility update from the
  Master Patient Index (MPI) and facilitate the addition of the
  Department of Defense (DoD) as a treating facility correlation.
   
  The SOURCE ID (#.01) field is a unique system assigned identifier for
  a patient record.  If SOURCE ID is from the Master Patient Index, the
  value is the Integration Control Number (ICN).  If SOURCE ID is from
  the Department of Defense (DoD), the value is the Electronic Data
  Interchange Personal Identifier (EDIPI), which is their equivalent of
  an ICN.  In the future, SOURCE ID may come from other sources due to
  additional initiatives.
    
  The IDENTIFIER STATUS (#1) field indicates whether the record is active
  on the identifying system (e.g., VAMC or DoD) or if the record was 
  identified as part of a duplicate pair, has been merged, and is no
  longer active on the identifying system.
   
  Issue #2
  A new Remote Procedure Call (RPC), VAFC LOCAL GETCORRESPONDINIGIDS,
  has been created.  When supplied with a patient DFN, Integration
  Control Number (ICN), or DoD's Electronic Data Interchange Personal
  Identifier (EDIPI), the RPC will return specific data.  The returned
  information includes the list of Treating Facilities where the patient
  has been seen, the station number of that facility, the SOURCE ID and
  the IDENTIFIER STATUS.
  Routine VAFCTFU2 contains the code called by the new RPC.
   
  Issue #3
  A new Remote Procedure Call (RPC), VAFC NEW NC TREATING FACILITY,
  has been created for use by the North Chicago Common Registration User
  Interface (UI).  The RPC allows the UI to add an active Department
  of Defense correlation to the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file
  if it does not already exist.  The RPC then returns the list of
  Treating Facilities where the patient has been seen, along with the
  SOURCE ID, INSTITUTION, and IDENTIFIER STATUS.  Routine VAFCTFU2 contains
  the code called by the new RPC.
   
  Issue #4
  VistA Health Level Seven (HL7) message changes have been made to support
  the joint VA/DoD medical center venture.  These changes include the
  following:
      - Process the new format for the Update Treating Facility (MFN~M05)
        message and update fields in the VistA TREATING FACILITY LIST
        (#391.91) file.
      - The VistA code has been enhanced to handle the format for both the
        new and old Treating Facility Update messages until patch MPI*1.0*77
        is installed on the MPI.  The MPI will start transmitting the new
        message format when all sites have installed this patch.
      - The Master File Update Acknowledgment (MFK~M05) response builder
        code has been modified to generate a response using the new format.
      - Depending on the value in the MFE-2 (HL7 table 0180), update the
        new SOURCE ID (#20) multiple field's IDENTIFIER STATUS along with
        the SOURCE ID.  Basically, if the MFE-2 contains MAD or MUP, update
        IDENTIFIER STATUS to A (for Active) and the if MFE-2 contains the
        new value of MDC, then update IDENTIFIER STATUS to H (for merged).
        The entry in the SOURCE ID multiple is only updated if DFN is
        passed in the MFE segment.
  Routines VAFCTFIN, and VAFCTFU have been enhanced to provide this
  functionality, and routines VAFCOFIN and VAFCOTFU ensure continuity until
  patch MPI*1.0*77 is installed on the MPI.
   
  Issue #5
  The DG DATA SERVER option and routines DGDATA, DGDATA01, and DGDATA02
  are being removed via this patch if they exist on your system.  These
  elements were used for centralized reporting purposes many years ago
  and are obsolete.
    
  New Remote Procedures:
  ======================
  - VAFC LOCAL GETCORRESPONDINGIDS
  Given a patient DFN, ICN, or EDIPI, this Remote Procedure Call returns
  a list of Treating Facilities, including SOURCE ID, station number, and
  IDENTIFIER STATUS.
  - VAFC NEW NC TREATING FACILITY
  Given a patient DFN and DOD EDIPI, this Remote Procedure Call adds an
  active Department of Defense correlation to the TREATING FACILITY LIST
  (#391.91) file if it does not exit and returns a list of all Treating
  Facilities where the patient is known.
   
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  The SOURCE ID (#20) multiple has been added to the TREATING FACILITY
  LIST (#391.91) file
     
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patch DG*5.3*821.
  Facilities should download the revised documentation listed as
  follows:
   
      HL7 Interface Specifications        DG5_3_P821MPIF_IS.PDF
      Technical Manual                    DG5_3_P821RG_TM.PDF
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.
  
  OI Field Office         FTP Address                  Directory

  Note:  The file must be transferred in binary or IMAGE,
         not ASCII, mode.
