Subject: CV END DATE EXTENSION PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 The National Defense Authorization Act FY 08 (NDAA), enacted on January 
 28, 2008, extended the time period for Combat Veteran (CV) Eligibility
 from two to five years.  Veterans who currently have a Combat Veteran End
 Date will have that date recalculated by the Health Eligibility Center 
 (HEC).  The updated CV End Date information will be shared by the 
 HEC with all sites of record for a veteran.
  
 Veterans are Combat Veteran eligible if they have served in a combat
 location since 11/11/1998 and their most recent separation date 
 (either Service Separation Date or OEF/OIF To Date - hereafter referred 
 to as the Service Date) is on or after 11/11/1998. Those veterans who 
 register or enroll after installation of this software patch and who are 
 Combat Veteran Eligible will have their Combat Veteran End Date
 calculated according to the following criteria:
  
 -       Veterans with no enrollment prior to the NDAA date 
 (1/28/2008) and with a Service Date on or after January 28, 2003 will 
 have a Combat Veteran End Date set to five years after that service date.
 -       Veterans with no enrollment date prior to the NDAA date and with 
 a Service Date prior to January 28, 2003 will have a Combat Veteran End 
 Date set to January 27, 2011.
 -       Veterans with an enrollment prior to the NDAA date who are in a 
 Rejected status and whose Service Date is prior to 1/28/2003 will have a 
 Combat Veteran End Date set to January 27, 2011
 -       Other Veterans with an enrollment prior to the NDAA date will 
 have a Combat Eligibility End Date set to their Service Date plus five 
 years.
  
 The criteria for determining if a Veteran is Combat Veteran Eligible is 
 not being changed with this patch. Once a Combat Veteran End Date is
 populated in VistA it cannot be edited by site personnel; thus, it is of
 paramount importance to ensure data entry is correctly executed. The
 Health Eligibility Center considers Combat and OEF/OIF data from all
 sites of record when determining the CV End Date.
