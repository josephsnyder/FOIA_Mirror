Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
  This patch is being released with a 5 day compliance date.  It is
  important that this patch be installed no later than the compliance date
  to ensure Veterans with new VHIC cards are recognized by vendor products.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 *************************************************************************
 **   IMPORTANT - The install of this patch removes all the old VIC     **
 **   related software.  Be sure and back up the routines listed below  **
 **   since there are 35 routines removed from your system with the     **
 **   install of this patch.  None of the routines are used by class 1  **
 **   software and none of them should be used by class 3 software.     **
 *************************************************************************
  
  
 This patch provides support for the new VHIC (Veteran's Health Information
 Card) card, formerly known as VIC (Veteran Identification Card) card, to
 provide interoperability in remote systems.  The main Patient Identifier
 (PID) segment builder is being updated to use the new VHIC card as an
 identifier source.  This will allow remote systems such as ScriptPro that
 utilize the Outpatient Automation Interface (OPAI) interface to use the
 information on the new VHIC card for patient identification.
  
 This patch will also remove all legacy VIC software from the VistA systems
 to ensure it isn't used anymore since the old application is now obsolete.
  
  
 Issue #1:  When patients presented at the pharmacy to pick up their
 outpatient medications some sites utilize 3rd party COTS (Commercial Off 
 The Shelf) products that rely on patient identifying information contained
 in the PID segment of HL7 messages.  Because the new VHIC card no longer
 contains the patient's social security number, there was no common
 identifier between the barcode on the VHIC card and data in the HL7 PID
 segment.
 Solution:  This patch adds the current active VHIC card numbers to the HL7
 PID building utility.
  
 Issue #2:  Some HL7 messages were occasionally being generated from old
 VIC workstations when the operations relating to those old workstations is
 obsolete.
 Solution:  This won't stop the old workstations from operating but to
 eliminate possible interaction between the workstations and VistA the
 legacy VIC card software is being removed from VistA.  All the components
 should be deleted with the install of this patch.
