Subject: DISABLE SSN UPLOAD ON HL7 Z11 MESSAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will disable incoming HL7 Z11 Eligibility/Enrollment Data
 Transmission messages from uploading SSN data into the SOCIAL SECURITY
 NUMBER field (#.09) in the PATIENT file (#2) on Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000322652 - ADT-A31 CLIENT VS. ORU-Z11 CLIENT
                   Dup - HD0000000326574
  
   Problem:   Prior to the release of Enrollment VistA Changes Release 2
              (DG*5.3*688), the Z11 message would not upload if the SSN in the
              Z11 did not match the SSN in VistA.  The current Z11 upload code
              uses the INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN) for matching the
              Veteran.  As a result of this change, when a Z11 message is
              received and the ICNs match, the Z11 uploads regardless of the
              SSN values. The SSN is an identity trait owned by MPI and
              should not upload with the Z11.
  
   Solution:  The HL7 Z11 upload process has been modified to disable uploading
              the SSN.
