Description:
============

 This patch adds 4 new Treating Specialty (TS) codes, inactivates

 It also updates the FACILITY SUFFIX (#45.68) file and the STATION TYPE
 (#45.81) file for approved suffixes. 
  
 *************************************************************************
 **PLEASE NOTE:  Compliance date for each site will differ depending 
  on the scheduled date for implementation which was provided in both, an
  email from John Quinn and forum message 51451855.  On your scheduled
  implementation date your IRM POC will be contacted with the 
  username/password to obtain the KIDS build from the protected 
  directory. Site questions and problems should be reported via Remedy to
  MAS 5.3 for administrative questions and the appropriate clinical team
  for clinical related issues. Sites have a 2 week window for 
  installation/implementation; after that support requests that do not
  involve patient safety risks will take a lower priority than sites 
  in the current phase.
  Sites must change from the old Psychiatric Residential Rehabilitation
  Treatment Program (PRRTP) codes 25,26,27 to the new DOM specialties
  1K,1L,1M upon implementation of the patch but no later than 6/1/2010.
  These changes need to be made and necessary actions taken per memorandum
  from Under Secretary for Health dated 10/15/2009.
                                               
 **Please ensure IB*2.0*426 is installed prior to installing this patch.**

 HD0000000347628 - Update Treating Specialty Code
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Treating code changes are needed.
  
  
 Solution:
 =========
   
 The following modifications are implemented in this patch:
  
  A. Add New Treating Specialty Codes
     Four new treating specialty codes will be added to the SPECIALTY
     (#42.4) file and the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file.
     The specialties listed below will have the following defined, unless
     otherwise noted.

    *****PLEASE NOTE:  Treatment Specialty Code *(1N)* is used to 
    designate specialty inpatient rehabilitation treatment provided at the 
    four Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRC) in Minneapolis, Palo Alto,
    Richmond, and Tampa. The PRCs have designated Polytrauma beds for the 
    provision of highly specialized and intensive rehabilitation care to 
    active duty Service Members and Veterans with severe and multiple
    trauma, with particular focus on those returning from Operations Iraqi
    Freedom and Enduring Freedom.  Polytrauma beds are separate from the
    general rehabilitation beds (classified as bed section 20) operating at
    the Medical Centers with PRCs. Use of the Polytrauma Rehabilitation
    treatment specialty code is not permitted at any facility other than
    the PRCs, and for any beds other than the dedicated inpatient
    Polytrauma Rehabilitation beds.

    Note: If entries with the above PTF CODES already exist in the
    FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file, the existing entry will be 
    renamed as shown above. These entries need to be reviewed for accuracy.
    The sites are responsible for ensuring the correct SERVICE is
    identified in the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file.  Any other
    entries (if there is more than one) will be listed in the patch
    installation. 
    
    Please review the post-install instructions for further action if
    necessary.
     
    The post-initialization routine will create entries in the FACILITY
    TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file with the same NAME (#.01) field,  
    SPECIALTY (#1) field and EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01) field in the EFFECTIVE
    DATE (#100) multiple field found in the SPECIALTY (#42.4) file.  
  
  B. Inactivate Five Treating Specialty Codes.
  
    The following treating specialty codes within the SPECIALTY (#42.4) 
    file and the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file will become
    inactive and may not be used after 5/31/10.

  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
     
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message. 
       
      NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
             global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed

      new specialty codes were appropriately added to the 
      SPECIALTY (#42.4) file and FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY
      (#45.7) file.  The Install file print will confirm additions and
      identify any problems encountered during modification to these files
      done by the post-initialization routine.
  
  2. Verify the correct SERVICE is identified in the FACILITY TREATING 
      SPECIALTY (#45.7) file.
