Subject: VISTA PIMS API

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is to fix an error with the software logic in two Vista PIMS
 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) where the wrong string of data
 is returned. The problem could be passed on to any package that calls 
 Registration and would result in either extra, unneeded or no data.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 HD0000000363619     Vista PIMS VAFHLPV1 APIs
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The logic for the software code in the Vista PIMS EN and DGBUILD APIs
 is incorrect as it does not account for an input string that is entered
 incorrectly.  In order for the software to return the correct string of
 data the input string must be preceded by a ",".  
  
 The EN API is used by packages outside of Registration (DG) to return
 Health Level 7 (HL7) messages about a certain patient.  The DGBUILD APT is
 an internal DG call that returns information about a patient with a 
 deleted admission.  
  
 The problem with the logic is that the data being relayed back to the 
 calling routine could contain extra, unneeded or no data for a patient. 
  
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A check was created in the software to ensure that the inputted string is
 formatted correctly for the logic that is used.  The software for 
 both APIs was changed to be the same format, eliminating the chance for
 errors due to a bad input string.
