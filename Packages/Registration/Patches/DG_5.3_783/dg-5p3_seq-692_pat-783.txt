Subject: CHANGE DEFAULT PROMPT TO ENTER MT DATA ON PRE-REGISTRATION TO NO

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes the default for a Means Test prompt in the 
 Pre-registration menu. Many sites have requested to change the default 
 for the prompt "Do you wish to proceed with the means test at this time?" 
 from "YES" to "NO" in the Pre Registration option of the Select 
 Preregistration Menu Option.
   
 Currently, the default is set to YES, but most of the users do not have 
 the access or knowledge to complete the means test.  As a result they are 
 likely to answer "NO" to agree to pay and veterans are mistakenly being 
 dis-enrolled.  Consequently the erroneous information must be manually 
 corrected.

 HD0000000206404 - Change default to NO on "Do you want to complete MT?"  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
  
 HD0000000206404 - Change default to NO on "Do you want to complete MT?"  
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When using the pre-registration options there is a prompt that asks the 
 user "Do you wish to proceed with the means test at this time?". The 
 default is currently set to YES.  With the default set to YES,  most of 
 the users do not have the access or knowledge to complete the test.  As a 
 result they are likely to answering NO to agree to pay and veterans are 
 mistakenly being dis-enrolled.
  
 Resolution:
 ============
 The default for this prompt has been changed so that the code will 
 recognize when the call is being made from Pre-registration Options.  A 
 check for the existence of a flag set by the pre-registration package 
 will set the default to NO when displaying the prompt.
