Subject: DISABLE BULLETINS & CORRECT UNDEFINED ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes an <UNDEFINED> error that occurs when the patient's permanent
 address is entered or edited.  The error occurs when no response has been
 entered at the COUNTRY prompt and the system times out.
  
 The 'RATED DISABILITY UPDATED' bulletin will be disabled and no longer
 generated during the End of Registration Consistency Checks when a user makes
 a change to the patient's Rated Disability.
  
 The 'STATUS VS. DATE OF DEATH DATA DISCREPANCY' bulletin will be disabled and
 no longer generated when changes are made to the patient's enrollment
 information and when VistA receives a Z11 HL7 message from the HEC (Health
 Eligibility Center).
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000313065 - Change of text for the 'RATED DISABILITY UPDATED'
 HD0000000315896 - Remove the three Bulletins, reference ticket #313065
  
   Problem:   Changes to functionality and more frequent eligibility updates
              from the HEC have resulted in a large increase in the number of
              alerts and bulletins received at each site.  Due to the large
              volume of routine alerts, sites have expressed concern that truly
              critical bulletins may be missed.  A decision was made to disable
              some bulletins and alerts carrying routine information to reduce
              the load on the users.
  
   Solution:  The 'RATED DISABILITY UPDATED' bulletin will be disabled and no
              longer generated during the End of Registration Consistency Checks
              when a user makes a change to the patient's Rated Disability.

                   Dup - HD0000000315609
  
   Problem:   An <UNDEFINED>FOREIGN+12^DGADDUTL error is being generated when
              the COUNTRY field for a patient's permanent address is entered
              or edited.  The error occurs when no response has been entered at
              the COUNTRY prompt and the system times out.
  
   Solution:  Code has been added to the FOREIGN^DGADDUTL API and to the
              DGREGAED routine to properly handle the time-out issue.
  
  
 HD0000000315227 - VistA: Disable the STATUS VS. DATE OF DEATH 
  
   Problem:   Changes to functionality and more frequent eligibility updates
              from the HEC have resulted in a large increase in the number of
              alerts and bulletins received at each site.  Due to the large
              volume of routine alerts, sites have expressed concern that truly
              critical bulletins may be missed.  A decision was made to disable
              some bulletins and alerts carrying routine information to reduce
              the load on the users.
  
   Solution:  The 'STATUS VS. DATE OF DEATH DATA DISCREPANCY' bulletin will be
              disabled and no longer generated when changes are made to the
              patient's enrollment information and when VistA receives a Z11 HL7
              message from the HEC.
