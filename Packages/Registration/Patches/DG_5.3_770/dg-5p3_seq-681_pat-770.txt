Subject: NO FUTURE APPTS. LISTED ON SCREEN 14

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 I. OVERVIEW
  
 This patch corrects a problem with future/pending appointments not
 listing on screen 14, the APPOINTMENT INFORMATION screen,
 when using the Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
 option. The future/pending appointments are not listing when
 appointments are made for RSA clinics under the Future Scheduling
 Replacements RSA menu.  Appointments scheduled for non RSA
 clinics using current scheduling options, will display on screen 14
 when using the the Load/Edit Patient Data option.  This discrepancy
 of listing only non RSA clinics is due to screen 14 checking  for valid
 appointments that have an entry in the APPOINTMENT (#1900)
 multiple of the PATIENT file (#2). RSA clinics do not update the
 APPOINTMENT multiple of the PATIENT file, so therefore the
 code considers them non appointments and are not displayed to the screen.
 A change has been made to the routine DGRP14 to take out the
 check of the APPOINTMENT multiple of the PATIENT file as both
 RSA and non RSA clinics call the Scheduling Encapsulation
 software where appointments are validated and retrieved before listing 
 them as future appointments.

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 This patch corrects the following problem:
  
 1.  When listing the future/pending appointments for
     patients on screen 14 of the Load/Edit Patient Data
     option, appointments do not list for RSA clinics. 
      
  
    Solution: Take out the call to check for an entry in the
                   APPOINTMENT Multiple of the Patient File,
                   as RSA clinics do not add an entry to the
                   appointment multiple.
