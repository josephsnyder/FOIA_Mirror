Subject: MISSING TREATING SPECIALTY IN PTF CENSUS RECORDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Correcting missing Treating Specialty code in PTF Census transmissions.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
   1) HD0000000216278-PTF Census Data into Austin
    
   Problem:
   ========
   It was reported there was a problem with the PTF census records
   transmitted to Austin.
   VistA is causing zeroes in the CDR field and blanks in the 
   Treating Specialty field to be transmitted to Austin. Both of 
   these fields are in the Bed Section record (C501) of the Census 
   transmissions for CNH. 
     
   Solution:
   =========
   DGPTR1 was using piece 13 of the transmission logic to check for
   the treating specialty. It was checking that piece for the addition
   of the alpha numeric Treating Specialties. Along with checking for 
   the specialty to be AN that piece also looked for a null specialty,
   (X'?.A)&(X'?.N)&(X'=" ") which allowed the record to go through 
   without the treating specialty. DGTPR1 has been changed to add another
   check (X'?.AN) and the 501 check has been changed to look at the new 
   piece 16 instead of piece 13.
