 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 HD0000000283649 - Treating Specialty Code updates needed
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Treating code changes needed for Fiscal Year 2010.
  
  
 Solution:
 =========
   
 The following modifications are implemented in this patch:
  
  
  A. Add New Treating Specialty Codes.
  
    Four new treating specialty codes shall be added to the SPECIALTY
    file (#42.4) & to the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file (#45.7)
    effective 10/1/2009. The specialties listed below shall have the
    following defined, unless otherwise noted. Please note:  Any new or
    open admissions or movements on or after 10/1/2009, need to use new
    or renamed specialty codes.
    Treating   Treating               Service  Billing Rate         MPCR

    1J        ED OBSERVATION          MEDICINE GENERAL MEDICAL CARE  1150
  
    Note: If entries with the above PTF CODES already exist in the 
    FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file (#45.7), the existing entry will be 
    renamed as shown above. These entries need to be reviewed for accuracy.
    The sites are responsible for ensuring the correct SERVICE is
    identified in the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file (#45.7). Any other
    entries (if there is more than one) will be listed in the patch
    installation. 
    
    Please review the post-install instructions for further action if
    needed.
     
    The post-initialization routine will create entries in the FACILITY
    TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file with the same NAME (#.01),  
    SPECIALTY (#1) and EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01) fields in the EFFECTIVE
    DATE (#100) multiple field found in the SPECIALTY (#42.4) file. 
    Entries can be modified in the Treating Specialty Set-Up [DG TREATING 
    SETUP] option found in the ADT System Definition Menu [DG SYSTEM
    DEFINTION MENU].
  
  
    Sites will need to complete the setup of the new facility treating
    specialty codes as follows.
  
    Use the Treating Specialty Set-Up [DG TREATING SETUP] option to
    initialize the number of patients for the new treating specialty and
    populate the SERVICE (#2), PROVIDER (#10) and if appropriate the
    ABBREVIATION (#99) fields located in the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY 
    (#45.7) file.
  
  
  B. Inactivate Three Treating Specialty Codes.
  
    The following treating specialty codes within the SPECIALTY (#42.4) 
    file and the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file shall become
    inactive effective 10/1/09.

    38                    PTSD CWT/TR
    
    NOTE: Please remember to move the patients that are assigned to these 
    Treating specialties to the appropriate Treating specialty.
  
  C. Change MPCR code for seven Treating Specialty codes.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, HOWEVER because
  PTF options need to be placed out of order, we suggest it be 
  installed after business hours.
     
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
     
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message. 
       
      NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
             global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed
             you will need to repeat this step.
      
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
      
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*813):
      a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*813.
    
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
      Install? NO//', respond NO.
    
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', respond NO.
     
  7.  When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
      When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
      enter:
                
           PTF Menu                    [DG PTF MENU] 
           Load/Edit PTF Data          [DG PTF SCREEN]
   
     When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
     Order':' Enter 'return'.
  
  
 ========================POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS=========================
  
 1.   Please review the post-initialization results to assure the new 
      specialty codes were appropriately added to the SPECIALTY (#42.4) and
      FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) files. The Install file print
      will confirm additions and identify any problems encountered during
      modification to these files done by the post-initialization routine.
  
 2.   Use the Treating Specialty Set-Up [DG TREATING SETUP] option in
      the ADT System Definition Menu [DG SYSTEM DEFINITION MENU] to
      initialize the number of patients for each new treating specialty and
      populate the SERVICE (#2), PROVIDER (#10) and if appropriate the
      ABBREVIATION (#99) fields within the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY 
      (#45.7) file.
  
 3.   Sites are reminded that the facility treating specialty may be added
      through the Treating Specialty Set-up [DG TREATING SETUP] option.
      It is not necessary to rerun the installation to add a specialty to
      the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file if the specialty was
      added to the SPECIALTY (#42.4) file.
  
 4.   Verify the correct SERVICE is identified in the FACILITY TREATING 
      SPECIALTY file (#45.7).
  
 5.   Delete routine DG53P813 after a successful installation of the patch.
