Associated patches: (v)DG*5.3*688  <<= must be installed BEFORE `DG*5.3*750'

Subject: PATIENT NAME AND CATASTROPHIC ALERT FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch does the following:          
 - Ensures that the Registration package will store long patient names
   properly.
 - Catastrophic edit (CE) warning will not be displayed if only the pseudo
   SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) field & the PSUEDO SSN REASON (#.0906) 
   fields are changed.
 - Catastrophic edit warning will be displayed if two or more edits to any
   potential CE field (patient name, ssn, dob, sex) have been done on the 
   same day.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1) HD0000000179019- PATIENT LOAD/EDIT filing >30 chars in Patient NAME
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] option is allowing more 
 than 30 characters in the patient name field. This violates the
 Data Dictionary rule that limits the length of the PATIENT NAME field
 (#.01) of the PATIENT file (#2) to 3-30 characters and was also reported
 by the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) as causing problems with processing
 HL7 messages.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine DGRPECE has been modified to prevent this violation from 
 occurring.
  
 Post-init routine DG53P750 will correct any patient names that are over 30
 characters by truncating the middle name and if needed, will truncate the
 first name.
  
 Routine DGRP1 was changed to allow up to 28 characters (instead of only up
 to 23) to be displayed for the family name on Screen #1.
  
  
 2) HD0000000201084- Changing SSN Causes Catastrophic Edit Alert
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When using Screen #1 in the Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
 option to enter a pseudo SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER field (#.09), users are 
 required to enter a PSEUDO SSN REASON field (#.0906) which produces a
 catastrophic edit warning although no change is made to the other patient
 identifiers.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine DGRPECE has been modified not to count the Pseudo SSN Reason as a
 catastrophic edit field.
  
  
 3) HD0000000183757- Catastrophic Edit at Puget Sound
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The following two problems were reported in this remedy ticket:
  
 1)  If the user edits a single field and exits the load/edit session and 
 subsequently edits an additional demographic field, the CE alert is not 
 displayed.
  
 2) If the user is editing demographics, edits a single field and 
 completes the edits, the user would have to select 1 again to edit 
 demographics and edit a second trigger field that would generate a CE
 alert.  In this scenario if the fields are not edited in a consecutive
 fashion, the CE alert is not generated.
  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 After the count of edits are received in DGRPECE routine, routine DGRPAUD
 will be called if one change has been made in the current session. DGRPAUD
 will go through the audit file and see if any other potential Catastrophic
 Edit field changes were made during the current day for the patient, then
 count the changes. If the total count is two or more an alert is
 generated.
  
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, HOWEVER because
  certain Registration options need to be placed out of order, we strongly
  suggest it be installed after business hours.
   
  Installation may take an hour or more, depending on how many records are
  in the PATIENT file (#2) and how many require updating.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
   
      NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
             global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed
             you will need to repeat this step.
   
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*750):
      a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*750.
   
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', respond NO.
   
  6.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
      When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
      enter:
             Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
             Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
             Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
             Collateral Patient Register [DG COLLATERAL PATIENT]  
   
      When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
      hit enter.
  
 POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 To obtain a list of the patients that were updated, execute 
 PRTRPT^DG53P750 after patch installation; provided the ^XTMP("DG53P750"
 global is still available (it has a 90-day purge period). Use a 132 column
 output to get output for patient on one line.
  
    Example:
  
 CHEY20 13d1>D PRTRPT^DG53P750
  
 DEVICE: HOME// 0;132;999  TELNET TERMINAL
