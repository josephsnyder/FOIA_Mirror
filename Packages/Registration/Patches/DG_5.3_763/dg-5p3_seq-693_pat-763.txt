Description:
============

  This patch contains functionality to support the Hold Debt to DMC project.
  The Hold Debt to DMC project is being undertaken to avoid inappropriate
  debt referrals to Debt Management Center (DMC) for veterans who are either
  Service Connected (SC) 50% to 100% or in receipt of a VA pension. 
  
  Features of this project are as follows:
  
   1.  Prior to this patch, email bulletins were sent to the G.IB MEANS
       TEST mail group when a patient had a change in C&P status
       resulting from an ORU/ORF~Z11 message upload from the Health
       Eligibility Center (HEC).  The subject of those mail messages
       generated by the previous functionality was in the following
       format:
  
          Subj: C&P Alert: TESTING,PATIENT (T####)  [#755232]
  
          This patch decommissions the use of the C&P Alert email bulletin.
  
   2.  The ENROLLMENT RATED DISABILITY UPLOAD AUDIT file (#390) is a new
       file introduced by this patch.  The file is utilized to track new
       or modified Rated Disability changes received from the Health
       Eligibility Center via ORU/ORF Z11 messages.  Historical audit
       data will be retained in this file for a period of 365 days on a
       given patient.  Once an entry is 365 days old, that entry will be
       purged by a new option introduced by this patch.  The option name
       is Enrollment Rated Disability Upload Audit Purge [DGEN RD UPLOAD
       AUDIT PURGE]; please see the options section below for more
       information.
  
   3.  This patch establishes a new Application Programmer Interface
       (API), $$RDCHG^DGENRDUA, which returns Rated Disability changes
       and other related information to the Accounts Receivable (PRCA)
       package. The correct usage of the API is covered under a private
       integration agreement between the Registration (DG) package and
       the Accounts Receivable (PRCA) packages.  The integration
       agreement control number is 5036; please see the forum DBA menu
       for more detailed information about the details and proper usage
       of this API.
