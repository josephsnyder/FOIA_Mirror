 Description:
 ============
 EMERGENCY Patch-Due to the constraint that this patch, in support of a 
 Congressional mandate, must be implemented prior to June 15, 2009 and in 
 order to identify any issues, sites must install this as an Emergency 
 patch with installation within 48 hours of receipt.  
  
 On June 15, 2009, the enrollment of veterans in healthcare will be 
 increased for the first time since January 2003.  This patch supports 
 this initiative by changing the initial enrollment evaluation to 
 incorporate the new rules governing the existing Priority Group 8.  
 Currently, Priority Group 8 includes sub-priorities a, c, e, and g where 
 groups a and c include enrolled veterans and sub-groups e and g are 
 rejected.  This patch adds two new enrollment sub-groups b and d whose 
 definitions are as follows:
  
 Subgroup 8b includes 0% non-compensable service-connected veterans who 
 apply for enrollment on or after 1/1/2009 and their current Income Year 
 Means Test identifies income above the VA Means Test (MT) or Geographic  
 Means Test (GMT) Threshold (whichever is higher)  by 10% or less.  This 
 group also includes those 0% non-compensable service-connected veterans 
 whose current Income Year Means Test shows net income under the MT 
 Threshold and net income plus assets greater than or equal to eighty 
 thousand dollars.
  
 Subgroup 8d includes Non-Service Connected veterans who apply for 
 enrollment on or after 1/1/2009 and their current Income Year Means Test 
 identifies income above the MT or GMT Threshold (whichever is higher) by 
 10% or less.  This group also includes Non-Service Connected veterans 
 whose current Income Year Means test shows net income under the MT 
 Threshold and net income plus assets are greater than or equal to eighty 
 thousand dollars.
  
 The Enrollment Group Threshold is set to sub-group 8d starting on 
 6/15/2009.  This threshold allows those veterans in sub-groups 8b and 8d 
 to be enrolled for healthcare. Any application dates manually entered as 
 prior to 6/15/2009 will reflect the previous priority group 
 designations.  The Enrollment System provides the ultimate determination 
 of enrollment and will continue to update VistA with final enrollment 
 status.
