         (Registration) is being released along with IVM*2*154 (Income

  *****************************************************************************
   
  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
  Enrollment System (ES) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility
  (VistA REE) software to support the requirements of the Discontinue Annual
  Means Test Renewal project.
   
  This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
   
  1.  A Means Test (MT) stub record with a status = Required shall be
      created as follows:
   
  - When a person is subject to a MT and there is no MT on file.
   
  - When a person is subject to MT and latest Primary MT on file is
    status = No Longer Required and more than 1 year old.
   
  - When a person is subject to MT and latest Primary MT on file is more
    than 1 year old as of the "VFA Start Date" (Veterans Financial
    Assessment) of January 1, 2013 and MT Status is MT Copay Exempt, GMT
    (Geographical Means Test) Copay Required, or Pending Adjudication
    (where the GMT Threshold is greater than the MT Threshold).
   
  2.  The search for a person will no longer display a MT alert if a person
      is subject to MT and the latest primary MT is less than 1 year old as
      of the VFA Start Date of January 1, 2013 and MT Status = MT Copay
      Exempt, GMT Copay Required, MT Copay Required, or Pending
      Adjudication.
   
  3.  The search for a person shall display a Means Test alert as follows:
   
  -  When a person is subject to MT and there is no MT on file.
   
  -  When a person is subject to MT and latest Primary MT on file is
     status = Required.
   
  -  When a person is subject to MT and latest Primary MT on file is more
     than 1 year old as of the "VFA Start Date" of January 1, 2013 and MT
     Status is MT Copay Exempt, GMT Copay Required, or Pending Adjudication
     (where the GMT Threshold is greater than the MT Threshold).
   
  4.  If a Veterans Means Test status = Required the following alert will
      display:
                  *** Patient Requires a Means Test ***
              Primary Means Test Required from (MAY 22, 2012)
      Note: This alert will not display if there is no stub record in VistA.
   
  5.  VistA shall continue to allow the user to add a new Means Test if
      there is no Means Test on file for the current income year, and the
      Veteran is subject to Means Testing.
   
  6.  An added test will become effective immediately, regardless of the
      age of the current Primary Means Test.
   
  7.  An added test will become effective immediately, regardless of the
      impact to the Veterans Enrollment Priority and/or Means Test Copay
      status.
   
  8.  VistA shall not allow a user to add a new Means Test if a Veteran
      is subject to a Means Test and a Means Test exists for the current
      income year.
   
  9.  A user can adjudicate a Means Test for up to 1 year from the
      effective date of the test if a Means Test status = Pending
      Adjudication.
   
  10. A user must add a new Means Test if adjudicating the test is
      desired and the Means Test is Pending Adjudication and is more
      than 1 year old from the effective date of the test.
   
  11. If a user attempts to adjudicate a Means Test that is more than 1
      year old, a prompt will display directing them to use the Add a
      New Means Test option.
   
  12. A Means Test can only be completed within 1 year of the date the
      stub test was created. If a user tries to complete a required
      Means Test and the date of test is more than 1 year in the past,
      a prompt will display to the user directing them to add a New
      Means Test.
   
  13. VistA shall allow a Means Test to be edited for 1 year from the
      Means Test Effective Date.
   
  14. VistA shall display a prompt directing the user to the add a New
      Means Test option if they attempt to edit an existing Means Test
      that is more than a year older than the Means Test Effective Date.
   
  15. A hardship can only be added during the current income year of the
      Means Test.
