 Subject: VIC PATIENT IMAGE CAPTURE SOFTWARE (PICS) ENHANCEMENTS Version 3
  
 Category
  - Informational
  
  I. OVERVIEW
   
 This is an informational patch notifying sites of the release of a new 
 version of the Patient Image Capture software (PICS) application used in 
 conjunction with the Veteran Identification Card (VIC) Replacement 
 software.  The purpose of this informational patch is to provide field 
 personnel with instructions on how to acquire and install the latest 
 Patient Image Capture software (PICS). Additionally, this patch will also 
 provide field personnel with information regarding the retrieval of 
 end-user documentation for the system.
  
  II. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 This new version of the PICS application will provide the VIC workstation 
 user with much greater functionality.  In the current version of PICS, 
 most of the card request information is available only through the NCMD 
 web interface.  Under the new version of PICS 3 the user will get several 
 informational tabs that provide key information on card details with ease 
 and accuracy. These include pending card requests, additional 
 connectivity status information, the PICS audit log and the PICS settings.
  
 The updated software will also allow future PICS software upgrades to be 
 performed automatically by the VIC Workstation user via a Click Once web 
 tool.
   
  III. ASSOCIATED VISTA PATCHES
   
  The following VistA patches should be installed prior to installing and
  implementing the Patient Image Capture software (PICS).
