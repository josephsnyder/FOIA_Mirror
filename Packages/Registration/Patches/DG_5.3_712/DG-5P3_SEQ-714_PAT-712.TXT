Description:
============

  DG*5.3*520, DG*5.3*653, and DG*5.3*707 are required builds for patch
  DG*5.3*712.
     
  This patch is in support of the Master Patient Index (MPI) Identity
  Hub Project for the Identity Management Data Quality (IMDQ) team. The
  project enables the change from the current MPI patient deterministic
  lookup to an Identity Hub based probabilistic patient lookup.
   
  Issue #1:
  A new style cross-reference has been added to three fields in the VistA
  PATIENT (#2) file so that when the field is edited, that information is
  included in the ADT/HL7 PIVOT (#391.71) file in order to update the
  Master Patient Index.
   
  A new FIELD INDEX type cross-reference, AVAFC<field number>, has been
  added to the following fields:
    
                BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121)
                EMAIL ADDRESS (#.133)
                PHONE NUMBER [CELLULAR] (#.134)
    
  These new cross-references make use of the DG FIELD MONITOR tool
  that was released in patch DG*5.3*527.  This tool utilizes the VAFC
  MPIPD FIELD TRIGGER protocol, which creates an entry in the
  ADT/HL7 PIVOT (#391.71) file, as well as sets the VAFCF variable to
  capture the fields that have been modified during an edit.  These
  fields are included in the existing Health Level Seven (HL7) 2.4
  messages generated by the MPI/PD applications.  Routine VAFCTR
  supports this effort.
   
  Post-install routine, DG712PST, will create the new FIELD INDEX
  type cross-references noted above.  It will also re-compile any
  templates associated with these fields.
  
  Issue #2:
  A MFN/M05 treating facility broadcast, Heath Level Seven (HL7) message
  is an update / delete message, that allows the TREATING FACILITY LIST
  (#391.91) file to be synchronized with the Master Patient Index.
  When this message is sent to a site to remove a treating facility from
  the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file, the delete is not properly
  occurring.  Obsolete business rules were in place to ensure that the
  Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) was the site that sent the message.
  Now, with Primary View, the Master Patient Index is the source of these
  messages; not the CMOR.  The checks for CMOR have been removed from
  the MFN/M05 process.  This correction is contained in routine VAFCTFPR.
    
  Issue #3:
  The following VAFC* options were distributed with patch DG*5.3*766
  (released 4/10/08) as obsolete with an Out of Order message.  These
  options are being distributed in this build as DELETE AT SITE in
  order to remove them from the OPTION (#19) file.
      Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER]
      Purge Patient Data Reviews [VAFC PDR PURGE]
   
  Issue #4:
  - The Identity Management Data Quality (IMDQ) team requested that
  AUDITING be turned on for the ALIAS (#2.01) multiple, ALIAS (#.01)
  and ALIAS SSN (#1) fields in the PATIENT (#2) file.  Post-install
  routine, DG712PST, will enable auditing on both of these fields.
  - Routine VAFCAUD has been updated to allow the Display Remote
  Patient Audit [MPI DATA MGT REM DISP PAUD QRY] option to show
  audited alias information for the IMDQ staff on the MPI.
   
  Issue #5:
  The Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] option has
  been enhanced to display BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR data if available.
  The data is derived from the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121) field in
  the PATIENT (#2) file.
  
  Issue #6:
  Post-install routine, DG712PST, will queue a job to populate the BAD
  ADDRESS INDICATOR field on the Master Patient Index.  This information
  will be used by the MPI probabilistic algorithm software in the event
  that the algorithm might automatically match a pair of records.  If the
  BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR on the MPI is set, then the threshold for an
  automatic match will be altered to prevent automatic linking of the
  records.  This will force a manual review on the MPI by the Identity
  Management Data Quality team before the match can take place.
   
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  A new FIELD INDEX type cross-reference, AVAFC<field number>, has
  been added to the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121), EMAIL ADDRESS (#.133),
  and PHONE NUMBER [CELLULAR] (#.134) fields in the PATIENT (#2) file.
  
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patch DG*5.3*712.
  Facilities should download the revised documentation listed as
  follows:
  
     DG5_3_712RN.PDF
     RG1_0_UM.PDF
     RG1_0_TM.PDF
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.
  
  OI Field Office         FTP Address                  Directory

  Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov        ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
   
  Note:  These files must be transferred in binary or IMAGE,
         not ASCII, mode.
   
  The documents can also be downloaded from the VistA Documentation
  Library (VDL) Web page in both Acrobat PDF and MS-Word DOC formats:

  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  The post-install routine, DG712PST, uses the ^DIE("AF" cross-reference
  to find all compiled templates on fields that were edited in the PATIENT
  (#2) file for MPI/PD, and re-compiles the templates associated with 
  any of the fields referenced by the new cross-references created in this
  patch. It also turns AUDITING on for the fields ALIAS (#.01) and ALIAS
  SSN (#1), within the ALIAS (#2.01) multiple, in the PATIENT (#2) file.
  
  The post-install routine will also queue a job that reads through all
  of the entries in the VistA PATIENT (#2) file. If there is a value in
  the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121) field, and the record has a valid
  national INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (#991.01), the routine will send an
  HL7 message to the MPI to update that corresponding field in the patient's
  record on the MPI.  When the queued job completes, it will send a VistA
  e-mail message with the subject line "Results from running patch
  DG*5.3*712 at station: xxx" to the person who installed the patch,
  notifying them of the number of records that were updated.  The MPI
  development team will also be notified in order to track when this
  task has completed across all facilities.
  
  NOTE: If you do not receive the e-mail message, or if the e-mail message
  text shows that errors were found, please do not delete the post-install
  routine DG712PST. A remedy ticket should be logged to investigate why an 
  error was encountered for that record. Once the issue(s) are corrected, 
  then you can run the part of the post-install that updates the BAD
  ADDRESS INDICATOR field on the MPI by running UPDBAI^DG712PST from
  programmer mode. Once the e-mail message shows that records were
  successfully updated, you can delete the post-install routine DG712PST.

  2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state.
  
  3.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
      Note:  TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display
      the patch text only.
