Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*972 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 DG*5.3*972 is being released with IVM*2.0*183 in Host File 
 DG_53_P972.KID.
  
 DG*5.3*972 is also being released in support of the Enrollment System 
 (ES) 5.5 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1*173 (Enrollment 
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 IMPORTANT
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following patches, which all include functionality for Medal of 
 Honor, will be released concurrently and should be installed in the
 following order:
  
 1. Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture 
    (VistA) Registration, Eligibility, & Enrollment (REE) Registration (DG)
    patch DG*5.3*972, released with Income Verification Match (IVM) patch
    IVM*2.0*183 in Host File DG_53_P972.KID, ensures Veterans awarded 
    Medal of Honor are placed in Priority Group 1 and are exempt from
    copayments for health care and medications.
  
 2. Patch IVM*2.0*183, released with DG*5.3*972 in Host File 
    DG_53_P972.KID, modifies how VistA determines if an income test is the
    current, active test per Veteran's Financial Assessment (VFA) rules and
    adds a condition that Medal of Honor recipients are not subject to
    income testing.
  
 3. Patch EAS*1.0*174 ensures VistA users can exempt Veterans awarded 
    Medal of Honor from Long Term Care (LTC) copayments and LTC income
    testing.
  
 4. Integrated Billing (IB) patch IB*2.0*627 will need to be installed
    directly after EAS*1.0*174 as the full functionality of Medal of Honor
    will not be apparent until IB*2.0*627 is installed.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Public Law 114-315, signed into law on December 16, 2016, amends
 United States Code Title 38 Section 1705 to place Veterans awarded the
 Medal of Honor into the highest Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 Enrollment Priority group - Enrollment Priority Group 1. Veterans awarded
 Medal of Honor are currently assigned to Enrollment Priority Group 3.
  
 PL 114-315 amends United States Code Title 38 Section 1710(a), 1710B, and
 1722A and exempts Veterans awarded Medal of Honor from copayments for
 health care, medications, and extended care services.
  
 Additionally, PL 114-315 provides that all Veterans awarded the Medal of
 Honor currently enrolled for VA hospital care and medical services, and
 whose Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enrollment records are not
 currently assigned to Priority Group 1, will have their enrollment record
 updated to reflect enrollment in Priority Group 1 and exemption from
 copayments for health care, medications, and extended care services.
  
 ES sends VistA REE an HL7 message (ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11) passing the CURRENT
 MOH INDICATOR, MOH AWARD DATE, and MOH STATUS DATE. VistA REE receives
 the data and stores the information in the PATIENT file (#2) and PATIENT
 ENROLLMENT file (#27.11).
  
 VistA REE calculates the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE based on the MOH
 AWARD DATE received from ES and the MOH legislation date, December 16,
 2016. Refer to PL 114 - 315. This date is displayed in VistA REE for 
 manual billing reconciliation and informational purposes only.
  
 The following VistA REE screens are updated to display a patient's Medal 
 of Honor award indicator without condition, and to display the Medal of
 Honor award date, status date, and copayment exemption date:
   - The VistA REE options that display the MILITARY SERVICE DATA, SCREEN 
     <6> screen
   - The option Patient Enrollment [DGEN PATIENT ENROLLMENT] Page 3 screen
   - The Expand History [DGEN EXPAND HISTORY] action protocol within the 
     Patient Enrollment [DGEN PATIENT ENROLLMENT] option
   - The View Upload Audit [DGENUP VIEW ELIGIBILTY UPLOAD AUDIT] action 
     protocol within the Patient Enrollment [DGEN PATIENT ENROLLMENT]
     option 
  
 The Eligibility Inquiry for Patient Billing [DG PATIENT ELIGIBILITY
 INQUIRY] option is updated to display a patient's Medal of Honor award
 indicator as well as the Medal of Honor award date, status date and
 copayment exemption date.  It is also updated to display a patient's
 current Camp Lejeune eligibility.
  
 Integration Control Registration (ICR) 423 ($$AUTOINFO^DGMTCOU1(DFN)) is
 updated to use the PATIENT file (#2) CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541)
 in the auto exemption determination logic to determine if a patient is
 exempt from Pharmacy Co-Pay.

 Listing of Updates
 ==================
 This patch includes the following enhancements to VistA REE:
  
 1. The HL7 interface with ES is modified to include two additional data
    elements: 
    a. MOH AWARD DATE. The ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message populates sequence #4
       component 1 in the ZMH segment.
    b. MOH STATUS DATE. The ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message populates sequence #4 
       component 2 in the ZMH segment.
  
 2. When VistA receives an HL7 ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message, if the Medal of 
    Honor Indicator in the ZMH segment is YES and the patient is not a
    Veteran, VistA REE returns an error to ES "BAD VALUE, ZMH SEGMENT, SEQ
    3, NON VETERAN INELIGIBLE FOR MEDAL OF HONOR" and discontinues
    processing of the HL7 ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message.
  
 3. When VistA receives an HL7 ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message, the MOH AWARD
    DATE and MOH STATUS DATE are stored in the following locations:
    a. MOH AWARD DATE is stored in the MOH AWARD DATE field (#.542) 
       within the PATIENT file (#2).
    b. MOH AWARD DATE is stored in the MOH AWARD DATE field (#50.28)   
       within the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11).
    c. MOH STATUS DATE is stored in the MOH STATUS DATE field (#.543) 
       within the PATIENT file (#2).
    d. MOH STATUS DATE is stored in the MOH STATUS DATE field (#50.29)
       within the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11).
  
 4. When VistA receives an HL7 ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message, the MOH AWARD DATE 
    and MOH legislation date are used to calculate the MOH COPAYMENT
    EXEMPTION DATE. Once the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE is calculated, 
    it is stored in the following locations:
    a. MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#.544) within the PATIENT file
       (#2)
    b. MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#50.3) within the PATIENT
       ENROLLMENT file (#27.11)
    c. VistA will not store a future MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE.
  
 5. The business rules for processing the MOH AWARD DATE and MOH
    STATUS DATE received in the HL7 ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message are as follows:
    a. If there is no MOH AWARD DATE sent in the HL7 message, nothing
       is stored for the MOH AWARD DATE field (#.542) in the PATIENT file
       (#2) or in the MOH AWARD DATE field (#50.28) within the PATIENT
       ENROLLMENT file (#27.11). In addition, the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION
       DATE field (#.544) in the PATIENT file (#2) and the MOH COPAYMENT
       EXEMPTION DATE field (#50.3) in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file 
       (#27.11) are null.
    b. The MOH AWARD DATE and MOH STATUS DATE data elements are converted 
       to a VA FileMan (FM) date format. The PATIENT file (#2) MOH
       COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#.544) and the PATIENT ENROLLMENT
       file (#27.11) MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#50.3) are
       calculated as described below:
       i.   If the MOH AWARD DATE is not null and it is before the 
            legislation date (12/16/2016), then the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION
            DATE is equal to the legislation date.
       ii.  If the MOH AWARD DATE is the same date as the legislation date
            (12/16/2016), then the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE is
            the same as the legislation date.
       iii. If the MOH AWARD DATE is past the legislation date
            (12/16/2016), then the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE is the same
            as the MOH AWARD DATE.
       iv.  If the MOH AWARD DATE is null then the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION
            DATE is null.
       v.   If the MOH AWARD DATE is in the future or within 15 years of 
            birth, an error is returned to ES stating: "BAD VALUE, ZMH
            SEGMENT, SEQ 4, MH AWARD DATE BEFORE BIRTH DATE" as an
            Application Error (AE).
       vi.  If the MOH AWARD DATE exists but the MOH STATUS DATE does not 
            exist, then an error is returned to ES stating: "BAD VALUE, ZMH
            SEGMENT, SEQ 4, MH STATUS DATE MISSING" as an AE.
      vii.  VistA will not store a future MOH AWARD DATE or MOH STATUS 
            DATE.
  
 6. Priority Group Calculations:
    a. If the CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) in the PATIENT file (#2)
       is YES, and the patient is a Veteran, then the patient is placed in
       Priority Group 1 regardless of other eligibilities. When the
       patient has a current primary income test for the year and it is a
       MEANS TEST, the ANNUAL MEANS TEST file (#408.31) STATUS field
       (#.03) is stored as "NO LONGER REQUIRED". When the primary income
       test for the year is a CO-PAY EXEMPTION TEST, the STATUS field
       (#.03) in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST file (#408.31) is stored as "NO
       LONGER APPLICABLE".
    b. If the Current MOH Indicator is NO:
       i.   The Priority Group is recalculated based on the patient's 
            current eligibility factors. The current primary income test
            status is updated with the previous means test status from the 
            TEST-DETERMINED STATUS field (#2.03) in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST
            file (#408.31). The status then gets stored in the STATUS field
            (#.03) of the ANNUAL MEANS TEST file (#408.31) and in the
            CURRENT MEANS TEST STATUS field (#.14) of the PATIENT file
            (#2).
       ii.  The CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) in the PATIENT file 
            (#2) is set to and displays as NO. The MOH AWARD DATE field   
            (#.542) in the PATIENT file (#2) and the MOH AWARD DATE field
            (#50.28) in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11) are set to 
            null and display as blank.
       iii. The MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#.544) in the PATIENT 
            file (#2) and the MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#50.3) in
            the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11) are set to null and
            display as blank.
       iv.  The MOH STATUS DATE field (#.543) in the PATIENT file (#2) and 
            the MOH STATUS DATE field (#50.29) in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT
            file (#27.11) are set to and display the date received from
            ES.
    c. If the CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) in the PATIENT file (#2)
       is blank or null, the priority group calculation will place the
       patient in the correct priority group based upon other eligibility
       factors. The following fields are stored as null and displayed as
       blank:
       i.   PATIENT file (#2) CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) 
       ii.  PATIENT file (#2) MOH AWARD DATE field (#.542)
       iii. PATIENT file (#2) MOH STATUS DATE field (#.543)
       iv.  PATIENT file (#2) MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#.544)
       v.   PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11) MOH AWARD DATE field (#50.28) 
       vi.  PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11) MOH STATUS DATE field (#50.29)
       vii. PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11) MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE 
            field (#50.3)
   
 7. Additional updates so Veterans awarded Medal of Honor are not subject 
    to income testing in the Copay Exemption Test User Menu [DG CO-PAY TEST
    USER MENU] option and the Means Test User Menu [DG MEANS TEST USER
    MENU] option are as follows:
    a. ADD A COPAY EXEMPTION TEST [DG CO-PAY TEST ADD] option: If 
       the CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) from the PATIENT file 
       (#2) is YES, the user cannot add a new co-pay exemption test. A new
       reason for exemption is added for display when a Patient is awarded
       Medal of Honor: "Patient is awarded Medal of Honor, automatically
       exempted."
    b. EDIT AN EXISTING COPAY EXEMPTION TEST [DG CO-PAY TEST EDIT] option:
       If the CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) from the PATIENT file 
       (#2) is YES, the user cannot edit an existing co-pay exemption test.
    c. ADD A NEW MEANS TEST [DG MEANS TEST ADD] option: If the 
       CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) from the PATIENT file (#2) is
       YES, the user cannot add a new means test.
    d. EDIT AN EXISTING MEANS TEST [DG MEANS TEST EDIT] option: If the
       CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) from the PATIENT file (#2) is
       YES, the user cannot edit an existing means test.
  
 8. Auditing is turned on for the following PATIENT file (#2) fields:
    a. CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541)
    b. MOH AWARD DATE field (#.542)
    c. MOH STATUS DATE field (#.543)
    d. MOH COPAYMENT EXEMPTION DATE field (#.544)
  
 9. The HELP PROMPT text for the CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) in the
    PATIENT file (#2) is updated. The field is read only and can be 
    viewed from the List File Attributes [DILIST] option in the Data
    Dictionary Utilities [DI DDU] menu, which is under the VA FileMan menu 
    (DIUSER).

 Integrated Billing (IB) patch IB*2.0*627 will be released in conjunction 
 with this patch. IB*2.0*627 will need to be installed directly after this 
 patch as the full functionality of Medal of Honor will not be apparent
 until IB*2.0*627 is installed. Refer to IB*2.0*627 patch description for
 further information.
  
 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service 
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 Any issues would need to be evaluated to determine if: a back-out of the 
 software is appropriate; a new patch is needed; or if data requires 
 correction or restoration.
   
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a
 backup of other VistA software components, such as DD, cross-reference,
 and template changes.
