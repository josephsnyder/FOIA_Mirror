Subject: MISSING PATIENT - Patient Record Flag

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 The Missing Patient, Patient Record Flag (PRF) project (patches 
 DG*5.3*869 and TIU*1*279 combined) is new development of Missing Patient, 
 PRF functionality within the Veterans Health Information Systems and 
 Technology Architecture (VistA) system of applications.  This new PRF is 
 to assist in fulfillment of Directive 2010-052 - Management of Wandering 
 and Missing Patients.
  
 This Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive establishes policy to 
 ensure that each Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical facility 
 has an effective and reliable plan to prevent, and effectively manage 
 wandering and missing patient events that place patients at-risk for harm.
   
 * Note - There will be no changes to any Local Category (CAT) II PRFs 
 associated with this Missing Patient PRF project or any of its 
 components. This project is strictly creating a new, National CAT I PRF 
 and Text Integration Utilities (TIU) note for missing patients. Each 
 facility should manually deactivate any CAT II Missing Patient PRFs and 
 only use this newly created CAT I flag going forward per VACO memo 
 guidance dated 4/23/2013.  
  
 FEATURES
 --------
 1. Patch DG*5.3*869 creates a new 'Missing Patient' National PRF entry in 
 the PRF NATIONAL FLAG FILE #26.15. This new, National (Category I) PRF 
 will be defined as follows:
          Name:  MISSING PATIENT
  
          Status:  ACTIVE
  
          Type:  CLINICAL
  
          Review Frequency Days:  30
  
          Notification Days:  7
  
          Review Mail Group:  DGPF MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW
  
          TIU PN Title: PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I - MISSING PATIENT
  
          Description: The purpose of this flag is to identify a missing
          patient/resident (patient) in the electronic medical record,
          including a Text Integration Utilities (TIU) progress note 
          describing the risk and circumstances.
  
  
 2. Patch DG*5.3*869 gives the ability to deactivate and activate the 
 "MISSING PATIENT" PRF.
  
 *Note: Activating or Deactivating the flag is a manual process. The 
 status of the flag will be Active while the patient is missing. The user 
 will not have the ability to delete the flag but will have the ability to 
 deactivate the flag when the patient has been found.  Also, the flag and 
 history remains within the PRF package.
  
 3. This Missing Patient - PRF project (specifically TIU*1*279) creates a 
 new national TIU Note Title, PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I - MISSING 
 PATIENT, to associate with the new "MISSING PATIENT" flag.
  
 4. Patch DG*5.3*869 creates mail group, DGPF MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW. 
  
 5. Patch DG*5.3*869 updates Dialog Number 261132-Patient has local ICN, 
 to not reference any specific National, Category I PRF.
  
 6. Patch DG*5.3*869 updates these existing PRF reports to include the new 
 Missing Patient PRF data:
    Assignment Action Not Linked Report
    Flag Assignment Report
    Patient Assignments Report
    Assignments Due For Review Report
    Assignments Approved By Report
