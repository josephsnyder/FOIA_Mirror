Subject: VIC HL7 LOGICAL LINK UPDATE 09/03/08

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 PURPOSE: This patch will update the HL7 Logical Link: VIC NCMD on your 
 production account only. This link currently uses a hard coded IP
 address.  The update will use a domain name (VETERANS1.ONEVA.VA.GOV)
 through the national DNS.   This will allow for the NCMD server to be
 moved without the release of a patch to change the IP address.
  
 PLEASE NOTE:  This patch will remove the IP Address from your Test 
 Account and the DNS name will not be populated.
  
  
 Global ^HLCS(870,ien,0)
 The routine will find the 'ien' (Internal Entry Number) 
 by looking at HLCS(870,"B","VIC NCMD",ien)
 Then the first data piece ('^') will be updated with the new data.
  
 This patch will be executed only once.  
 Sites may manually remove the M Routine following successful
 installation. routine name: DG774PF
