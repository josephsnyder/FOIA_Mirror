Subject: 2008 MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 NOTE: The Health Eligibility Center (HEC)  will install Patch
 IVMB*2.0*925 (IY 2007 MT/GMT/RX THRESHOLDS) before January 1, 2008.
  
 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2007-042 - This patch MUST be installed before January 
 1, 2008.  The patch is being released as an emergency patch (together 
 with EAS*1.0*85 (2008 GMT Thresholds) and IB*2.0*379 (2008 RX Copay 
 Thresholds) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to other
 released Registration (DG) patches.
  
 The Means Test thresholds for Income Year 2007 provided in VHA DIRECTIVE
 2007-042, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR 
 CALENDAR YEAR 2008 are distributed with this patch.  The 
 post-installation routine, DG53768P, will create a new subentry (or 
 replace an existing one) for calendar year 2008 in the MEANS TEST DATA 
 (#250) multiple field of the MAS PARAMETERS (#43) File.  Six subfields 
 within the multiple will be updated with the new Means Test threshold 
 data values as follows:
  
        MEANS TEST DATA (#.01) - 2008
        MT COPAY EXEMPT VET INCOME (#2)  - $28,429
        MT COPAY EXEMPT 1ST DEP INCOME (#3) - $5,688
        MT COPAY EXEMPT INCOME PER DEP (#4) - $1,909
        THRESHOLD PROPERTY (#8) - $80,000
        CHILD INCOME EXCLUSION (#17) - $8,950
  
 In addition, this patch will update the following fields in the 
 PARAMETERS File (#8989.5) for Income Year 2007:
  
        DGMT MAPR GLOBAL RATE         5
        DGMT MAPR 0 DEPENDENTS        11181
        DGMT MAPR 1 DEPENDENTS        14643
        DGMT MAPR N DEPENDENTS        1909
  
 Six fields within the MAS PARAMETERS File (#43) will also be made 
 un-editable by this patch.  Depending on the environment at your site, 
 additional routines may be created during installation.  These are not 
 core routines sent with the patch but rather a by-product of the changes 
 made to the data dictionary in support of DG*5.3*768.  If your environment
 does not require such routines, none will be created.
  
 This patch, DG*5.3*768, is one of three VistA 2008 threshold patches.  It 
 updates the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual Pension 
 Rate.  Patch EAS*1.0*85 will address the annual updates for the GMT 
 Thresholds and patch IB*2.0*379 will address the annual updates for the 
 Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.

       ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation will 
 take approximately 15 minutes.  The Geographic Means Test Threshold files 
 GMT THRESHOLDS #712.5 and GMT MSA CODE #712.6 updates (for every zip code 
 and every county) in patch EAS*1.0*85, are extensive.  Due to the volume 
 of updates, the installation process will appear to stall and/or stop.  
 This is normal, as the file updates may take up to 15 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entries 
 will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are 
 approximately 23,000 entries included in the #712.5 file (and 
 approximately 50,000 entries included in the #712.6 file) distributed 
 with this patch and a comparison is done on each of these entries. It is 
 possible your session may time out before the install has completed.  If 
 so, you may not be able to get a complete screen capture of the compare.  
 This will not, however, mean that there is any problem with the software.
  
   1.   DOWNLOAD HOST KIDS FILE
        -----------------------
        Download the KIDS file DG_53_P768.KID from the
        ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt
        Lake OIFO to the appropriate directory on your system.
  
   2.   LOAD DISTRIBUTION
        -----------------
        Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION
