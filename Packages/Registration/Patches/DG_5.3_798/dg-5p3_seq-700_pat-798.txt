      ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. The patch should not be
 queued to run. Installation will take approximately 15 minutes. The
 Geographic Means Test Threshold files GMT THRESHOLDS #712.5 and GMT MSA
 CODE #712.6 updates (for every zip code and every county) in patch
 EAS*1.0*89, are extensive. Due to the volume of updates, the installation
 process will appear to stall and/or stop. This is normal, as the file
 updates may take up to 15 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entries 
 will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are approximately
 26,000 entries included in the GMT THRESHOLDS file #712.5 (and
 approximately 50,000 entries included in the GMT MSA CODE file #712.6)
 distributed with this patch and a comparison is done on each of these
 entries. It is possible your session may time out before the install has
 completed. If so, you may not be able to get a complete screen capture of
 the compare. This will not, however, mean that there is any problem with
 the software.
