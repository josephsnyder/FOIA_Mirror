Description:
============

 Changes to the Veterans Health Integrated Systems Technology Architecture
 (VistA) software have been requested by the Veterans Administration (VHA) to
 enhance existing transportation services for VA patients.  This Veterans
 Transportation Services (VTS) project will integrate the VA's RideShare
 service with VistA. This patch allows the ability to assign a patient to
 Veteran transportation services in VistA.  This identifies a Veteran
 requesting transportation to a qualified medical appointment arranged
 through VistA scheduling service.  The RouteMatch RideShare program is used by
 transportation coordinators to schedule pickup and delivery of veterans to and
 from their appointments.
 
 RouteMatch is the vendor for the RideShare commercial off the shelf (COTS)
 software. This  DG*5.3*853 Patch will allow integration of VistA with the
 RideShare application through a Data Interface Module (DIM) which is an
 enhancement to the RideShare software.
 
 The VA has an enterprise license for the RouteMatch RideShare software
 application but deployment is limited to sites until program funding is
 available for additional sites.  However this VistA patch should be installed
 at all sites.  This will assist all sites transportation coordinators to
 track veterans requesting alternate transportation services until RideShare
 services are available.
 
 
 Complete list of patch items:
                                                
 1. A new 'VTS PATIENT FLAG (#3000)' field is added to the Patient file (#2).
 2. A new option DG VTS RIDESHARE (Send New Patient to RideShare (COTS))
    is added.
 3. A new 'DG VTS RIDESHARE' security key is added.
 4. Routine DGVTS00 is created, and is used to compare Route Match to
    VistA patients.
 5. Routine DGVTSFS is created, and is used during Patient selection
    and VTS FLAG setting.
 6. Routine DGVTSA28 is created, and composes the HL7 message transmitted
    to Route Match.
 
 The new DG VTS RIDESHARE option should be assigned to the Transportation
 coordinator.
 
 
 IMPORTANT!
 
 ...FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RideShare (COTS) Software WILL OCCUR AT A
 LATER DATE....
 
 This VTS program can be deployed in two phases.  This first phase deployment
 includes the installation of the DG*5.3*853 VistA patch.  The Second phase is
 the configuration and deployment of the DIM enhancement to send HL7 messages
 to RideShare application.
 
 Phase 1
 1. Adds a new Routine DGVTSFS is created to populate a 'VTS PATIENT FLAG
    (#3000)' field in the Patient file (#2).      
 2. Provides a new option DG VTS RIDESHARE which uses routine DGVTSFS.   
 3. Adds new 'DG VTS RIDESHARE' security key for Transportation Coordinators.
 4. Routine DGVTS00 is created, and is used to compare RouteMatch data to
    VistA  patients.
 5. Routine DGVTSA28 is created, to compose an A28 HL7 message with Veteran ICN 
 
 
 Phase 2
 6. Vitria Interface Engine (VIE team provides port and site IP address to route
    A28 HL7 message to RideShare database at AITC.
 7. Site configures sender/listener for A28 HL7 message.
 8. AITC configures RideShare DIM sender/listener to acknowledge HL7 message.
 
 
 
 NEW VISTA enhancements
 
 Routine "DGVTS00"
 
 Used for initial population of ICN data and updating data files.
 
 A RideShare database file holding patient entries at AITC is compared 
 to the Patient file (#2) in VistA.  
 - If the data matches, the patient's Integrated Control Number (ICN) will
   be written to a file holding successful matches.  The matched file will
   be sent to RouteMatch RideShare to upload the ICN into their database.
 - If no matching entry is found in the Patient file an entry will be made
   in a RideShare error file.  
 
 Option DG VTS RIDESHARE
 
    Used to flag field in VistA Patient file for RideShare services.
 
    The new DG VTS RIDESHARE option should be assigned to the Transportation
    coordinator.  
 
 Security Key 'DG VTS RIDESHARE'
 
    Used to provide access to the Routine "DGVTS00" and the Menu Option "SEND
    NEW Patient to RideShare (COTS)".  
 
    The new 'DG VTS RIDESHARE' security key is assigned to the Transportation
    coordinator.
 
 RIDE SHARE WORK FLOW
 
 The procedure followed by Transportation coordinators when setting up a
 Veteran for using the transport system is described in this section of the
 patch.  After selecting a Veteran, the following actions occur:
 
 1. The new 'VTS Patient Flag (#3000)' field is populated, indicating
    that the patient is now associated with the provided transportation system.
 2. An HL7 message is created in the VistA HL7 package, and
    transmitted to the Vitria Interface Engine (VIE).
 3. The Vitria Interface engine routes the HL7 message to the
    RideShare COTS product (RouteMatch).
 4. RouteMatch will use the HL7 message to create the patient in the
    Ride Share system.
   
  PATCH FUNCTIONALITY:
 
 1. A routine DGVTS00 that is run when a file containing RideShare 
    patients is available for your site.
 
 2. A new field (VTS FLAG) added to the patient file to mark patients 
    as RideShare patients.
 
 3. A new option added DG VTS RIDESHARE allows patients to be
    selected marking their VTS PATIENT FLAG, and generate / send an HL7
    message to RideShare.
 
 The new option should be assigned to the Transportation Coordinator.
 Routine DGVTSFS is for Patient selection and VTS FLAG setting.
 Routine DGVTSA28 is for composing the VTS HL7 message.
