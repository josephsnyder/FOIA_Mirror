 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 INC000000961159 - Mail Group not created
  
 Problem:
 -------
 It has been reported from a few sites that the install process for the 
 new Missing Patient, Patient Record Flag (PRF), along with the new DGPF
 MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW mail group set up had not completed successfully.
  
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Follow these instructions and ensure your site had no issues with 
 installing the Missing Patient PRF and DGPF MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW mail
 group:
  
 1.     All sites should have already installed patch DG*5.3*869 by 
 01/26/2014. Due to issues found at some sites we are requesting
 that you please verify that the mail group, DGPF MISSING PT FLAG
 REVIEW, has been created.  
    
    *If the mail group and the new Category I PRF are not created
     as part of the installation process, there could be a potential
     patient safety issue at your site.
  
    *The mail group (DGPF MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW) must exist before
     the MISSING PATIENT, Patient Record Flag will be added to the 
     Patient Record Flag file.
  
  
  
 2.    If the mail group is not created, please manually add the mail 
 group (DGPF MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW) Mail Group:
  
    *Using option Mail Group Edit  [XMEDITMG], enter the following
     information:
  
       NAME: DGPF MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW   TYPE: public
       ALLOW SELF ENROLLMENT?: YES         RESTRICTIONS: UNRESTRICTED
       ORGANIZER: user designated as mail group coordinator
  
  
  
 3.    Reinstall the DG*5.3*869 patch only. Be aware that the install 
 prompts a question for the "Name of the Mail Group Coordinator" which 
 will need to be answered.
  
  
 4.    After the above steps are completed, verify that the Missing
 Patient PRF was added to the PRF National Flag file:
  
    *Using FileMan Inquiry verify entry MISSING PATIENT was added to the
     PRF NATIONAL FLAG (#26.15) file.
  
  
  
 The "Missing Patient PRF_Installation Guide" has also been updated with
 this information.
  
  
 If you experience any issues with the install process, please log a 
 ticket with the national service desk  at 888-596-4357.
