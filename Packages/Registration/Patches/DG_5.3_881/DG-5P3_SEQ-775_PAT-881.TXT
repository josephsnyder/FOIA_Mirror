Subject: VETERANS HEALTH IDENTIFICATION CARD (VHIC) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.2

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) web application version 4.2
 provides enhancements and addresses several defects identified within the 
 initial national release of VHIC version 4.1 September 2013.
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
  
   - Allow clinical applications to support positive patient identification
     with the card
   - On-screen guidance for improved photo capture to support the end-user
     when capturing the Veteran image
   - Improved reliability surrounding the Veteran in-person proofing 
     process
   - Hover-Over help text providing more specific user guidance for the
     application screens
   - Ability to designate the Veteran Branch of Service on the physical
     card
   - Addition of the following status reports necessary for supporting
     local, regional, and VHIC Program operations:
        1.  Card Status - Card Status Report
        2.  Card Status - Print Release Status Report
        3.  Cards Printed Without EDIPI
        4.  Card Issued Multiple Times - Summary Report
        5.  Card Issued Multiple Times - Detail Report
  
  
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 After national rollout in September 2013, we continued to accumulate the 
 card requests, yet halted production of the cards until this release so 
 that we could address the new version of the card. VHIC 4.2 will be 
 released in mid-February 2014 and start printing the accumulated card 
 requests at that time.
  
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The VHIC 4.2 is a centrally managed web-based application and will be 
 implemented as a one-time rollout by the VHIC Technical team (Insignia). 
 No software will be installed at the facilities.

 How to scan VHIC Barcode:
 =========================
 Turn on the barcode reader and aim it at the center of the barcode 
 ensuring the entire length of the barcode is within the lighted area.  
 Wait for the reader to pick up the data.  Many readers will also emit an 
 audible beep. If necessary, vary the distance and angle between the 
 reader and the barcode until the entire length of the barcode is 
 illuminated. The images of successful and failed scan are provided in the 
 Appendix H of the VHIC User Guide.

 Associated Remedy Tickets:
 ==========================
 #903802
 Problem:
 ========
 When a VHIC Associate processed a card request for a Veteran, VHIC may 
 retrieve incorrect information from the Enrollment system by using an 
 inactive correlated identifier found in the Master Veteran Index (MVI).
 Solution:
 =========
 When VHIC gets correlated identifiers from MVI, only active (A) records 
 are included in the response.  Including the passive identifiers affects
 picking the right correlation data out of MVI, affecting address
 verification through ESR.
  
 #903985
 Problem:
 ========
 After national rollout in September 2013, the card requests were 
 accumulated, yet halted production of the cards until this release. The 
 card request file was not sent to the Print Vendor.
 Solution:
 =========
 The VHIC card request file will be sent to the Print Vendor after VHIC 
 4.2 release.
