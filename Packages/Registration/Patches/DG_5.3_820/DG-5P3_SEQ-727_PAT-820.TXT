 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1. HD0000000340760 - Who Entered Patient field missing    bdj
  
 Problem:
 ========
  
 When entering a new patient, there are times when the WHO ENTERED PATIENT
 (#.096) field in the PATIENT (#2) file is entered as NULL or as an
 incorrect value.  
  
 This is caused by a situation where FileMan is called by FileMan using ^DIE.  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The software has been re-written to use a call to the FileMan Database API 
 UPDATE^DIE.     
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, as some
 Registration options are going to be out of order, it is recommended that
 the patch be installed during non-peak hours.
     
 Installation should take less than 2 minutes.
     
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message. 
       
      NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
             global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed
             you will need to repeat this step.
      
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
      
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*820):
      a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*820.
    
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', respond NO.
     
  6.  When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
      When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
      enter:
                
           Register a Patient          [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
           Load/Edit Patient Data      [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
   
     When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
     Order':' Enter 'return'.
