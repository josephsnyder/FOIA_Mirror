 Introduction
 ============
 The Office of Care Coordination, through the Home Telehealth Program, is 
 currently putting medical devices in patient homes to improve the quality 
 of care and standard of living for veterans throughout the United States.   
 From a technical point of view, each vendor's medical device communicates 
 with their central collection system (or server) located behind a VA 
 firewall at the Austin Corporate Data Center (ACDC).  Home Telehealth
 systems are expected to communicate with existing VHA computer systems
 using Health Level Seven (HL7).
   
 The Home Telehealth Program requires support for Patient Sign-up/Activation
 and inactivation to the program. The Care Coordinator will use a new VistA 
 menu to initiate the Patient Sign-up/Activation process.  Likewise, a VISTA 
 menu will be used to Inactivate a patient from Home Telehealth services. 
  
 Technical
 ---------
 Registration application was enhanced to add new functionality for the Home 
 Telehealth program.  The following components were added:-
 o  A new file HOME TELEHEALTH PATIENT file (#391.31) was created.
 o  Main menu option Home Telehealth Menu [DGHT HOME TELEHEALTH] was 
    created.
 o  The following submenu options were created under the Home Telehealth 
    Menu -
      Patient Sign Up/Activation      [DGHT PATIENT SIGNUP]
      Patient Inactivation            [DGHT PATIENT INACTIVATION]
      Patient Summary Report          [DGHT SUMMARY REPORT]
      Transmission Report             [DGHT TRANSMISSION REPORT]
 o  The option Home Telehealth HL7 Message Monitor [DGHT HL7 MESSAGE
    MONITOR] was added as a stand alone option for scheduling via Taskman
 o  Seven (9) new routines were added.  They are as follows-
        DGHTENR         DGHTINAC       DGHTHLAA
        DGHTHL7         DGHTRPT        DGHTRTX
        DG53644P        DGHTRPT1       DGHTXREF
 o  Routines DGHTENR and DGHTHL7 were created for the Patient Sign 
    Up/Activation option.
 o  Routine DGHTINAC was created for the Patient Inactivation option.
 o  Routine DGHTRPT was created for Transmission Report OPTION.
 o  Routine DGHTRPT1 was created for Patient Summary Report.
 o  Routine DGHTHLAA was created to process the application acknowledgement 
    received from the vendor server for Patient Sign-up/Activation and 
    Patient Inactivation.  This routine also generates a reject bulletin 
    to the mail group DGHTERR if appropriate.
 o  Routines DGHTRTX and DGHTXREF were created to monitor the processing 
    of messages and ensuring that application acknowledgments are received
    for all hl7 messages sent from the application
 o  Routine DG53644P was created as a post-install routine to update the 
    HL LOGICAL LINK file #870 with a local IP address for the link 'DG HTH'.
 o  The entry DG HOME TELEHEALTH was added to the HL7 APPLICATION 
    PARAMETER, file (#771) for the Home Telehealth application.  This entry 
    is used for processing out going HL7 messages.
    o  Protocol 'DG HOME TELEHEALTH ADT-A04 SERVER' was added to the 
       PROTOCOL file (#101) for the Patient Sign-Up/Activation process.
    o  Protocol and 'DG HOME TELEHEALTH ADT-A03 SERVER' was added to the 
       PROTOCOL file (#101) for the Patient Inactivation process.
 o  The entry HTAPPL was added to the HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER, file 
    (#771) for the Home Telehealth application.  This entry is used for 
    processing incoming HL7 messages from the Home Telehealth vendors.
    o  Protocol 'DG HOME TELEHEALTH ADT-A04 CLIENT' was added to the 
       PROTOCOL file (#101) for the Patient Sign-Up/Activation process.
    o  Protocol 'DG HOME TELEHEALTH ADT-A03 CLIENT' was added to the 
       PROTOCOL file (#101) for the Patient Inactivation process.
 o  The following entries  were added to the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) to
    facilitate the transmission of Home Telehealth patient data to Home 
    Telehealth vendor servers system via the Austin Interface.
      1   DG HT AMD  
      2   DG HT ATI  
      3   DG HT HH  
      4   DG HT VIT  
      5   DG HT VN  
 o  A mail group 'DGHTERR' was created to generate mail messages for any 
    transmission problems or rejects received from the VistA HL7 
    application or from the vendor server.
 o  Subscription to DBIA#3252 was granted by the Consult package to use the
    call GUI^GMRCASV1.
 o  Subscription to DBIA#2740 was granted by the Consult package to use the
    call OER^GMRCSLM1.
 o  Parameter Definition DG HTH # OF RETRANSMITS is being exported as a 
    site confiugrable parameter to identify the number of retransmits 
    that are allowed before a bulletin is sent to a mail group.
 o  Parameter Definition DG HTH DEFAULT WAIT TIME is being exported as a
    site configurable parameter to identify the amount of time to wait for
    AAs to be received before a retransmit is attempted.
 o  Parameter Definition DG HTH EXTENDED WAIT TIME is being exported as a
    site configurable parameter to identify an extended waiting time period
    before retransmission attempts are reinitiated when AAs are not
    received.
