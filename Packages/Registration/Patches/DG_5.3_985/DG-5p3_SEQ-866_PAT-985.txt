 Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment (REE) users need the ability to 
 enter, edit, and view the Veteran's Preferred Name throughout VistA so 
 that VA staff are able to correctly greet a Veteran during an encounter. 
  
 VistA Registration patch DG*5.3*937, released in May 2017, modified 
 VistA by adding the PREFERRED NAME field (#.2405) to the PATIENT file 
 (#2). See the DG*5.3*937 patch description for specific information on 
 how the Preferred Name is shared with Master Veteran Index (MVI). The
 DG*5.3*985 patch will allow VistA users to enter or edit the Preferred 
 Name using VistA Registration options.
  
 The VistA REE EMERGENCY CONTACT DATA, SCREEN <3> screen does not prompt 
 for a next of kin's phone number when the "ADDRESS SAME AS PATIENT'S?" 
 prompt is answered "YES". Only the next of kin's work phone number prompt 
 displays. VistA users are not able to enter the next of kin's phone
 number, which may be different from the patient's phone number. VistA REE
 does not accept/process ES deletions of the fields on the EMERGENCY
 CONTACT DATA, SCREEN <3> screen. Patch DG*5.3*985 will allow VistA users
 to enter the primary and secondary next of kin's phone numbers on the
 EMERGENCY CONTACT DATA, SCREEN <3> screen and will allow VistA to accept
 and process ES deletion of the fields on the EMERGENCY CONTACT DATA,
 SCREEN <3> screen received via ORU-Z05 Health Level 7 (HL7) message.
  
 Patch DG*5.3*985 will update the LONG DESCRIPTION (#.04) of the HEALTH
 BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) for the plan named VETERAN - FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS
 TREATMENT & RX COPAY EXEMPT. This is done with the post-install routine.

 Patch Installation:
 -------------------
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  
 A post install routine is included in the build. This routine updates the 
 LONG DESCRIPTION (#.04) field of the VETERAN - FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS 
 TREATMENT & RX COPAY EXEMPT plan in the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) file.
  
 The post-installation routine DG53985P will be automatically deleted upon 
 installation of this patch.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 1. This patch should NOT be installed while the IVM BACKGROUND JOB 
    [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] is running. The IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM BACKGROUND
    JOB] should be unscheduled. Use the Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM
    SCHEDULE] option on the Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu. Note the
    currently scheduled date/time.
  
 2. The HL7 incoming/outgoing filers should be stopped. Stop All 
    Messaging Background Processes by using the [HL STOP ALL] option on
    the Filer and Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on
    the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
  
 3. The following options should be disabled during installation:
     
             Register a Patient       [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
             Load/Edit Patient Data   [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
             View Registration Data   [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
             Patient Inquiry          [DG PATIENT INQUIRY]
             Eligibility Verification [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION] 
             Admit a Patient          [DG ADMIT PATIENT]
    
    This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it needs
    to be installed during non-peak hours since it checks all patients. 
    The install time will be dependent on the number of entries in the 
    PATIENT file (#2).
  
 Installation Instructions:

             will only bring up the last patch in the build.
  
    B. Select the Backup a Transport Global option to create a backup 
       message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup

      ii. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this

          patch, such as routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
    D. Select the Install Package(s) option and choose the patch to

             View Registration Data   [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
             Patient Inquiry          [DG PATIENT INQUIRY]
             Eligibility Verification [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION]

 Note: Patch DG*5.3*985 will modify the PREFERRED NAME field (#.2405) in 
       the PATIENT file (#2) from a FREE TEXT of 100 characters to 25 
       characters. There is an Environment Check routine DG53985E which 
       will run prior to the installation of the patch to check if there
       are any patients that have a Preferred Name that is greater than 
       25 characters. If there are no Preferred Names identified that 
       are greater than 25 characters, the Kernel Installation 
       Distribution System will proceed with the installation. 
  
       If there are one or more Preferred Names identified to be greater 
       than 25 characters, the Environment Check will generate the   
       patient's DFN and FULL ICN, the installation will abort, and the 
       build will be removed. Please use the Install File Print [XPD
       PRINT INSTALL FILE] option to print the Install File of the patch
       DG*5.3*985 and notify your Registration ADPAC or user with the list
       of patient DFN and FULL ICN that need to have their Preferred Name
       shortened or abbreviated to 25 characters. The patient must be 
       contacted to change the Preferred Name to one that conforms with the
       25 character limit. The Preferred Name(s) have to be corrected 
       using the ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES option in FileMan. The Host
       File will have to be loaded again and the installation restarted.
       The Environment Check routine is automatically deleted.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The HL7 incoming filers should be restarted. Use the Restart/Start All 
 Links and Filers [HL TASK RESTART] option on the Filer and Link
 Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu    
 [HL MAIN MENU]. 
  
 The IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] should be rescheduled.
 Use the Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] option on the 
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu. 
  
 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the ESD for assistance
 with the procedure.
  
 Any issues would need to be evaluated to determine if: a back-out of the 
 software is appropriate; a new patch is needed; or if data requires 
 correction or restoration.
   
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a
 backup of other VistA software components, such as DD, cross-reference,
 and template changes.
