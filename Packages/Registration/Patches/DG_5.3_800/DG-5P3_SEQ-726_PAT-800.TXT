Description:
============

  DG*5.3*449, DG*5.3*697, DG*5.3*707, and XWB*1.1*54 are required builds for
  patch DG*5.3*800.
   
  Background Information:
  The Veteran On-Line Application (VOA) project is a collaborative effort by
  the MyHealtheVet veteran web-portal, the National Enrollment Service (ESR),
  Person Services Identity Management (PSIM), the Master Patient Index (MPI),
  and the VistA Patient Information Management System (PIMS) application.
   
  *** PLEASE NOTE ALL CHANGES INTRODUCED BY THIS PATCH WILL BE DORMANT /
      HIDDEN TO USERS UNTIL THE RELEASE OF VOA EXPECTED LATER IN 2010.
     
  As soon as the Veterans' Online Application (VOA) system is fully
  implemented, the MyHealtheVet veteran web-portal and the National
  Enrollment System (ESR) will make it easier for a veteran to register
  for medical benefits from VHA via the World Wide Web.  This release
  supports the implementation of VOA; however, the functionality
  introduced herein is being released in a dormant state.
   
  Application process flow via VOA (presumes implementation of VOA system):
    1) The veteran completes the web-based application.
    2) The veteran's data is passed to the MPI through the Enrollment
       System Redesign (ESR) and Person Services Identity Management
       (PSIM).
    3) A record is created on the MPI and receives a National Integration
       Control Number (ICN).  The ICN is the unique identification number.
       The record is initially created with a TEMPORARY ID State.
    4) After a vetting process by ESR to determine the applicant's
       Enrollment Status, the ID State on the MPI is changed to PERMANENT.
       If warranted, this could be the result of in-person authentication.
    5) At that point, the VAFC VOA ADD PATIENT Remote Procedure (introduced
        by this patch) will be called to remotely add the patient to the
       Preferred Facility's VistA database.
   
  The following enhancements are distributed in patch DG*5.3*800 for the
  MPI and PIMS portion of the new functionality.
   
  Item #1:
  A new Remote Procedure, VAFC VOA ADD PATIENT, has been created to allow
  the remote creation of a VistA PATIENT (#2) record at the Preferred
  Facility for the Veteran On-Line Application (VOA) project.
   
  In order for the VAFC VOA ADD PATIENT Remote Procedure to function
  properly, RPC Broker patch XWB*1.1*54 MUST be installed and is a
  required patch for DG*5.3*800.
   
  Item #2:
  The VAFCPTAD routine is invoked by the VAFC VOA ADD PATIENT Remote
  Procedure.  Each required field necessary for the creation of a valid
  patient record is checked to ensure that the data meets the same input
  standards as a record created locally.  If any field fails the validity
  checks, the record is not created, and a reject or fail message is
  returned to PSIM and ESR.  If all required fields pass the validity
  checks, a new record is created on VistA, and the DFN for that record
  is returned to PSIM and ESR.  Reference private integration control 
  registration # 5364 for detailed information.
   
  Item #3:
  The IN-PERSON PROOFED (#.08) field has been added to the TREATING
  FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file on VistA.  This field is updated when
  the In-Person Authentication process is completed.
   
  Item #4:
  In routines VAFCTFIN and VAFCTFU code enhancements were made to the
  MFN-M05 (Treating Facility Master File Update) processor to include the
  processing of the IN-PERSON PROOFED (.08) field in the TREATING FACILITY
  LIST (#391.91) file.  This change supports the processing and updating
  of VistA files to allow VistAWeb and/or CPRS to see (or not see) the
  MyHealtheVet system record on the VistA site, based on the value of the
  IN-PERSON PROOFED (.08) field.
   
  Item #5:
  The existing "Get Treating Facility" API in routine VAFCTFU1 was enhanced
  to support the MyHealtheVet In-Person Authentication process.  MyHealtheVet
  requires that records be screened from the VistAWeb and/or CPRS user list
  at the VistA site if the In-Person Authentication process has not been
  completed.  If the IN-PERSON PROOFED (.08) field in the TREATING FACILITY
  LIST (#391.91) file for the MyHealtheVet (200MH) entry is not set to YES,
  then that record is not returned by the API or related Remote Procedure
  Call.
   
  Item #6:
  In-Person Authentication has already been performed on a large number
  of patient records in the VistA TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.
  These records need to have the IN-PERSON PROOFED (.08) field set to YES
  so they are accessible to CPRS and/or VistAWeb.  Post-init routine,
  DG53800P, examines the TREATING FACILITY LIST (391.91) file.  For the
  MyHealtheVet (200MH) records, it sets the IN-PERSON PROOFED (.08) field
  to YES.
    
  New Remote Procedure:
  =====================
  VAFC VOA ADD PATIENT
  This Remote Procedure Call allows the remote creation of a VistA
  PATIENT (#2) record at the Preferred Facility for the Veteran
  On-Line Application (VOA) project.

  to YES.  When the process finishes, the patch installer will be notified
  with an e-mail message.  This message provides the task number, begin
  time, and end time for the process.  In the event that you wish to stop
  the process after it has started, you can use the STOP^DG53800P line tag.
  The process can be restarted by using the STRTAGN^DG53800P line tag.
