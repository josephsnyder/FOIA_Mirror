IMPORTANT INFORMATION AFTER INSTALL OF EMERGENCY PATCH ICD*18*82

**Heads Up** ALL SITES MUST RELOAD REASONABLE CHARGES v3.17
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the ICD*18*82 patch is installed at your sites, the Reasonable 
Charges v3.17 - IB*2*556 charge files will have to be reloaded into the 
Charge Master for every division billed at your site.  There is no need 
to re-install the IB patch (IB*2*556), just reload the charges for V3.17 
following the patch instructions (see below).   If you do not reload the 
charges shortly after installing ICD*18*82, sites will not get charges 
for the new MS-DRG's 268-274 codes.  
 
 
Your IT/IRM staff will receive these instructions and should provide 
their assistance in reloading these charges for your divisions.
 
If you have manually loaded any of the National Interim Charges that were 
posted on our CBO website under Reasonable Charges, from May 2015 through 
September 2015, they will need to be manually re-added after the 
installation of the V3.17 charges files for this Inpatient rate update.   
The link to the National Interim Charges that will need to be loaded is 
as follows: http://vaww.va.gov/cbo/rcbilling/reaschgs.asp.  Again, let me 
stress that you will need to manually load the national interim charges 
once you have reloaded the charge files because they are not included in 
the V3.17 charge files.  
 
We will use the CBO Q&A database to track questions and share responses 
associated with this announcement.  Here is the link:

questions you may have into the CBO, Reasonable Charges Website for Q&A's

Upload Instructions:
====================
 
Step 1:  Get Host Files
-----------------------
Retrieve the 6 Reasonable Charges v3.17 Host Files in ASCII format (see
previous section).
                                       
Step 2:  Determine Divisions
----------------------------
Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and
print the Billing Regions report to find which Billing Regions and 
Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions 
that will need new charges loaded.
                                       
Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
-----------------------------
Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option 
to load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which
care is billed at your site. Carefully follow the instructions below, for 
each Billing Region. 
                                       
You will see the prompt:
      Select one of the following:
 
            1.1       Load CMAC into XTMP
            1.2       Load AWP into XTMP
            1.3       Load RC into XTMP
            1.4       Load TP into XTMP
            2         Assign Charge Set
            3         Check Data Validity
            4         Load into Charge Master
            5         Delete XTMP files
                                       
Below, in more detail, the steps will guide you through the process of 
selecting first 1.3, then 3, then 4, and wait until 4 stops before
continuing on to the next division (and capturing or printing all output 
for future reference).
 
Step 4:  Load the Reasonable Charges
------------------------------------
From the menu, select option 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
                                       
This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges
for individual Divisions.
                                       
  - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask 
    which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
    Select 3.17
 
  - When loading Reasonable Charges v3.17 the IBRC1510x.TXT files may be 
    used for multiple divisions without reloading.  
                                       
  - If there exists any previously calculated charges (files) for a 
    division, they will be displayed, and you will get the prompt:
 
        The above files already exist in XTMP.
        Delete the above files and continue with upload?
    Select Yes, to delete the previously calculated charges.
                                       
  - If there exist any previously loaded host files for any RC version, 
    they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.
    Select No, if the files are IBRC1510x.TXT since these are the  
    correct files for v3.17, they may be re-used for multiple divisions.
    Select Yes only if the files are from a different version.
                                       
  - Select Division:  Select the division number to load charges for. 
    This should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing 
    Regions determined previously.  Once the correct division is 
    selected, answer Yes to Calculate Charges.
 
Step 5: Check Data Validity
---------------------------
From the menu, select option 3 - Check Data Validity.
This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for
the first division loaded.
 
The following DRGs and Procedures are now inactive and will show as line
errors on this report, this may be ignored: DRG268, DRG269, DRG270, 
DRG271,
DRG272, DRG273, DRG274, 45355, 80440, 82000, 82003, 82055, 82101, 82145,
82205, 82520, C9136 and S8262.
 
If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors, then check that the
latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed. The Error key at the end
of the report does not mean that errors have occurred.  It simply provides
definitions of the types of errors that might occur.  Check the individual
line items in the report to see if any of the listed errors have been
detected.
 
Step 6: Load into Charge Master
-------------------------------
From the menu, select option 4 - Load into Charge Master
Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
 
It is important that this option completes before continuing.  Allow the 
upload of a division's charges to finish before attempting to upload 
another division.  A summary report will be printed when the upload is 
complete.  This option uses the same temporary files to calculate the
charges for all divisions, therefore they must be calculated and loaded.
 
 
Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
-------------------------------------------------
Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer 
to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
Region Report list determined previously.
 
In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable
Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 
-  Option 1.3, to calculate charges for a division
-  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
permanent files.
 
However, if you are loading charges for a new site, or a site that may 
have changed its division number, then extra care is needed to ensure 
the setup of the Charge Master is correct.
