  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  1. HD0000000232838 - DRG group wrong in PTF, but fine in IB
  
  Problem:
  ========
  The DRG calculator only calculates one code if there are duplicates and
  PTF screens don't allow entry of more than one operation code.
  
  Solution:
  =========
  Patch ICD*18*36 will correct the DRG calculations for FY07 and FY08.
  Routine ICDTBL4 has been changed for the calculation.
  Routine ICDDRGM has been changed to set up the surgical arrays for
  the calculation for the DRG GROUPER[ICD DRG GROUPER] option.
  
  Patch DG*5.3*785 will correct routine DGPTFJC to allow the entry of the
  second code.

     and Quantam VIP Stand Alone shows a DRG of 310.
  
  Problem:
  ========
  Vista is calculating a DRG of 309 that should be 310.

  the CODE NOT CC WITH multiple(#80.03) in the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (# 80)for
  code 427.32.

  Routine ICDDRGM has been changed to get the correct description for the 
  DRG displayed.

  NOTE:
  ====
  This patch will not show the correct DRG calculation for the 
  bilateral procedures unless patch DG*5.3*785 is also installed as the DG
  patch will allow for entry of the second code on the PTF screens and set
  up the surgical arrays used to calculate the DRG for bilateral
  procedures.
