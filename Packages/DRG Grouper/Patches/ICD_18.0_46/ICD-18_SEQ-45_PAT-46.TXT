Associated patches: (v)ICD*18*45   <<= must be installed BEFORE `ICD*18*46'

Subject: VARIOUS DRG GROUPER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) Grouper is used to compute and display
 the DRG for a patient based on that patient's diagnoses and any
 operations/procedures performed.  It uses a mixture of formulas, Diagnosis
 and Operation identifiers, and tables that rely on data added to the DRG
 (#80.2) file, the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE
 (#80.1) file.  These files, along with the date and the age of the 
 patient, determine the codes and other information needed to pass into the
 formulas and tables used in those formulas to calculate the DRG.  These
 codes and the DRG codes come from the Federal Register for Centers for
 Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and are updated and added to yearly
 effective October 1 of each year.  This patch corrects various DRG
 calculations.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
   
 1) HD0000000354584 - DRGs not calculating correctly
   
 Problem:
 ========
 a) DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 66 instead of 64
 b) DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 457 instead of 540 
  
 Solution:
 =========
 a) Changed table routine ICDTBL0B to look for operation identifier to
    point to the correct DRG code.
 b) Changed table routine ICDTBL4B to look for operation identifier to
    point to the correct DRG code.
   
 2) HD0000000351218- DRG's incorrect
   
 Problem:
 ===========
 DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 293 instead of 262
  
 Solution:
 ============
 Changed table routine ICDTBL2A AND ICDTBL2B to look for operation
 identifier to point to the correct DRG code.
  
 3)HD0000000358660- VISTA DRG's calculating is incorrect.
 Problem:
 ===========
 DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 230 instead of 221
   
 Solution:
 ============
 Changed table routine ICDTBL2B to look for valve procedure code (35.33) to
 point to the correct DRG.
   
 4)HD0000000363291- incorrect DRG since patch 145 for DRG 844/847
 Problem:
 ===========
 DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 844 instead of 847
   
 Solution:
 ============
 Changed table routine ICDTBL8B to go to DRG 846 for verification if no
 operation procedures.
  
 5)HD0000000362752- Vista DRG's 422 is incorrect
 Problem:
 ===========
 DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 422 instead of 410
   
 Solution:
 ============
 Add bile duct identifier to procedure code 51.42 in the ICD
 OPERATION/PROCEDURE (# 80.1) file. 
  
 6)HD0000000377980- Incorrect Calculation
 Problem:
 ===========
 DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 440 instead of 438
    
 Solution:
 ============
 Changed table routine ICDTBL4B to look for an operation identifier to
 point to the correct DRG code.
   
 7)HD0000000361653- VistA DRG 291 incorrect using 402.91
 Problem:
 ===========
 DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 292 instead of 291
   
 Solution:
 ============
 Changed table routine ICDTBL2B to check for existence of ICD codes 402.91
 and 428.33 to verify Major Complicating Condition (MCC).
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
 be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport global
            will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
            need to repeat this step.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*46):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ICD*18.0*46.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', respond NO.
  
 6.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
  
     When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
     enter:
             PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
     When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
     press enter.
  
 7.  Routines ICD1846* can be deleted after the patch has been
     successfully installed.
  
 8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
     [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] option in order to make the transfer
     DRGs correspond to the appropriate grouper.  This option 
     updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records opened during
     the current fiscal year (since 10/1/2009).
     The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
     is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
     current FY.
