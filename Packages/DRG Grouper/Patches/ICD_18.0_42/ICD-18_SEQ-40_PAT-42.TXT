 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
   
 1) HD0000000306020 - DRG configuration crossed over incorrect
   
   Problem:
   ========
   Site reported that DRG 343 is calculating as 376 in VistA.
   
   Solution:
   =========
   Change ICDTBL3A to use variable ICDOR instead of IDCOP to 
   get the surgical identifiers to use for calculation.
  
 2) HD0000000308046 - No DRG being pulled to a bill
  
   Problem:
   =======
   No DRG is being calculated for Obstetrician patients.
   
   Solution:
   ========
   Add identifier D to Diagnosis code 659.71 for delivery.
   This will be done in routine ICD1842L
  
 3) HD0000000322481 - DRG 343 and 743 not calculating correctly 
  
   Problem:
   =======
   a. DRG 343 is calculating as 376 in VistA
   b. DRG 743 is calculating as 761 in VistA 
   
   Solution:
   ========
   a. This DRG issue is being corrected in issue #1
   b. Change ICDTBL7A to use variable ICDOR instead of IDCOP
      to get the surgical identifiers to use for calculation. 
  
 4) HD0000000309669 - DRGs are incorrect
  
   Problem:
   =======
   DRG 280 is calculating as 282 in VistA, code should be MCC.
  
   Solution:
   ========
   Change ICDTBL2A to not use check for diagnosis codes 410.71 
   and 428.0. This is making it a non MCC DRG. There are some cases 
   where the combination will be an MCC. Changed ICDTBL2A to look for
   identifier H for secondary diagnosis and that will make the DRG an MCC.
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
  that Medical Records coders be off the system. 
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.

  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*42):
      a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the Transport Global.
      c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup

  POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
  Update Transfer DRG's for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] option
  in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the appropriate grouper.
  This should be done soon after installing the patch, but should 
  be run at a time when PTF options are not in use.
       
  This option updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records
  opened during the current fiscal year.
        
  The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
  is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
  current FY.
