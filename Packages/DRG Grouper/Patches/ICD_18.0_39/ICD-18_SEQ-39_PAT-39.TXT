   REMEDY OVERVIEW:
   ===============
   1. HD0000000295442 - DRG Code Mismatch
       
   Problem:
   ========
   Inpatient stay was coded for malig neoplasm of kidney and patient
   underwent a complete nephrectomy.  When the Patient Transfer File (PTF)
   was completed, the DRG calculated was 688 which is a Medical DRG.  
   Since this was a surgery performed, the DRG calculated should have been 
   DRG 658, which is the Surgical DRG for this diagnosis.
  
   Solution:
   =========
   Changed line DRG656 in routine ICDTBL6A to look for ICDOR variable to
   contain "O". This variable contains the identifiers for the procedures.
   If the variable contains the "O", the calculation will go to DRG686 so
   that the grouping will go to the surgical DRG.
  
       
   2. HD0000000297823 - DRG 592 in Vista does not match DRG 573 in 
      Quantim
     
   Problem:
   ======== 
   DRG 592 in VistA does not match DRG 573 in Quantim. 592 is a Medical DRG
   and 573 is a surgical DRG.
    
   Solution:
   =========
   Changed line DRG575 in routine ICDTBL5A to look for ICDOR variable to
   contain "O". This variable contains the identifiers for the procedures.
   If the variable contains the "O", the calculation will go to DRG592
   so that the grouping will go to the surgical DRG. 
   
   
   3. HD0000000294685 - DRG in VISTA 291 does not match Quantim DRG 292
   
   Problem:
   ======== 
   DRG in VistA 291 does not match Quantim DRG 292. Codes involved should
   not compute to the MCC DRG. 
   
   Solution:
   =========
   Add 428.0 as a code not CC to diagnosis code 428.21.
   Post init routine ICD1839P will add. 
  
   
   4. HD0000000299064 -DSS is getting a DRG of 981 and Vista 193
   
   Problem:
   ======== 
   VistA is grouping codes to DRG 193 Simple Pneumonia and Pleurisy 
   with MCC. Quadramed shows the DRG as 981 Extensive O.R Procedure 
   Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis with MCC. The code is incorrect in 
   VistA as the surgical procedures don't match with the Diagnosis of 
   Pneumonia.
   
   Solution:
   =========
   Changed line DRG194 in ICDTBL6A to look for ICDOR variable to contain
   "O". If it contains the "O" the DRG will be set to DRG 981.
  
   
   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
   that Medical Records coders be off the system. 
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
   
       NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
              global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed
              you will need to repeat this step.
   
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
    
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*39):
       a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the Transport Global.
       c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       ICD*18.0*39.
   
   5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', respond NO.
    
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO. 
    
   7. Routine ICD1839P can be deleted after the patch has been
      successfully installed.  
    
   POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
       Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
       DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs option in order to make the transfer 
       DRGs correspond to the appropriate grouper.
       This should be done soon after installing the patch, but should 
       be run at a time when PTF options are not in use.
        
       This option updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records
       opened during the current fiscal year.
        
       The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
       is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
       current FY.
