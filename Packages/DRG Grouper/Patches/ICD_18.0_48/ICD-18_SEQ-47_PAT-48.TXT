Subject: CORRECTIONS TO DRG CALCULATIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) Grouper is used to compute
 and display the DRG for a patient based on that patient's diagnoses
 and any operations/procedures performed. Per Federal guidelines 
 DRGs are classified by principal diagnosis and up to eight 
 additional diagnosis and up to six procedures performed during stay.
 It uses a mixture of formulas, Diagnosis and Operation identifiers, 
 and tables that rely on data added to the DRG file (#80.2),the 
 ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80)and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1).  
 These files, the date and the age of the patient determine the codes 
 and other information needed to pass into the formulas and the tables 
 used in those formulas to calculate the DRG.  These codes and the DRG 
 codes come from the Federal Register for Center for Medicare and Medicaid
 Services (CMS) and are updated and added to yearly effective 
 October 1 of the year.  
  
 This patch corrects various DRG calculations.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
   
 1) HD0000000383228-Calculations not Matching
   
 Problem:
 ========
 a) DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 666 instead of 664
 b) DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 309 instead of 310
 c) DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 670 instead of 688
 d) DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 023 instead of 098
 e) DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 666 instead of 663
   
 Solution:
 =========
 a) Changed table routine ICDTBL6B to look for operation 
 identifier to point to the correct DRG code.  
 b) Changed table routine ICDTBL3B to look for operation
 identifier to point to the correct DRG code.
 c) Changed table routine ICDTBL6B to look for operation 
 identifier to point to the correct DRG code.
 d) Changed table routine ICDTBL0B to look for operation 
 identifier to point to the correct DRG code.
 e) Changed table routine ICDTBL6B to look for operation 
 identifier to point to the correct DRG code.
  
 Also post install will add identifiers to diagnosis code 425.4,
 and to procedure codes 041.4 and 57.93.  
  
 2) HD0000000397928-DRG 064/66, 027/30, 459/490, 844/847
  
 Problem:
 =======
 a)DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 066 instead of 064
 b)DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 030 instead of 027
 c)DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 490 instead of 459
  
 Solution:
 =========
 a) Changed table routine ICDTBL0B to look for operation 
 identifier to point to the correct DRG code.  
 b) Remove major OR spine identifier from procedure code 86.94
 c) Add identifier for operation codes 81.05 and 81.63
  
 3) HD0000000425253-DRG correct in Quadramed, incorrect in VistA
  
 Problem:
 =======
 DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 3 instead of 4
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Changed table routine ICDTBL0B to look for Major Operation variable to 
 point to the correct DRG code.
  
    
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
 be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
   
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport global
            will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
            need to repeat this step.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*48):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ICD*18.0*48.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', respond NO.
  
 6.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//', respond Yes.
  
     When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
     enter:
             PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
     When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
     press enter.
  
 7.  Routines ICD1848* can be deleted after the patch has been
     successfully installed.
  
 8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
     Update Transfer DRGs for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] 
     option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the 
     appropriate grouper. This option updates/recalculates the transfer 
     DRGs for PTF records opened during the current fiscal 
     year (since 10/1/2009). The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP 
     security key.  The Menu path is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information 
     Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for current FY.
