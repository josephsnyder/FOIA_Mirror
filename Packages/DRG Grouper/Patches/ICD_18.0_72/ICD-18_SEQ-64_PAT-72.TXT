 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000892006 - DRG Grouper - Other: FY14 ANNUAL GROUPER UPDATE
   
    The changes were published in the Federal Register, Vol. 78, No. 160,
    dated August 19, 2013 with an effective date of October 1, 2013.
    All page references below are for this issue and resource documents 
    can be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/.
   
    Note: For FY2014 there are no new, revised, or deleted diagnosis 
          codes and no revised or deleted procedure codes that are usually
          announced in Tables 6A (New Diagnosis Codes), 6C (Invalid 
          Diagnosis Codes), 6D (Invalid Procedure Codes), 6E (Revised
          Diagnosis Code Titles), and 6F (Revised Procedure Codes).  
       
    Changes include:
       
      I.   Revised DRGs.
       
     II.   Revised DRG relative weights & average length of stay (ALOS)
           values for all DRGs.
   
    III.   DRG reclassification changes to the Grouper.
     
       
    This is a summary of the additions/changes made:
       
      I.   Routine ICD1872A was written to update the DRG file (#80.2).
   
     II.   Routine ICD1872A is also used to update the finalized values for 
           DRG relative weights and average length of stay (ALOS).
   
    Routines ICDDRG0 and ICDTBL0F-9F were added/modified to complete
    the proper grouping of the existing diagnosis codes and new 
    procedure codes.
        
    III.   DRG RECLASSIFICATION.
           
    Changes to other DRGs:
    ----------------------
       1. MDC 1 (p.50528)
       a. Effective 10/1/2013 cases that have a diagnosis code of V45.88 
          will move from MS-DRG 066 to MS-DRG 065.  Also, the title for
          MS-DRG 065 will change to Intracranial Hemorrhage or Cerebral
          Infarction with CC or TPA in 24 Hours.
    
    
       2. MDC 15 (p.50537)
       a. Effective 10/1/2013 cases that have diagnosis codes V64.00 through
          V64.04 and/or V64.06 through V64.3 will be reassigned from MS-DRG 794
          to MS-DRG 795.
  
  
 2) INC000000913160 - DRG Grouper - Other: inactivate DRG 119
   
    This year's annual DRG Grouper patch will also inactivate DRG 119

    DRG (MS-DRG) conversion, DRG 119 was inactivated and DRG 263 inherited
    the name/DRG description VEIN LIGATION & STRIPPING.
      
       
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 NOTE: Please do not forget to do step 6. This is a very important step 
 as it updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for Patient Treatment 
 File (PTF) records opened during the current fiscal year.
     
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  However, it would 
 be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
        
 Install Time - 5 to 10 minutes.
    
 This patch does not involve global file restoration. Nonetheless, we
 suggest you create global saves on files: ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80)-
 (^ICD9), ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1)-(^ICD0) and DRG file
 (#80.2)-(^ICD) in the event problems develop during the install. If
 it became necessary to use the saved files, you should first kill 
 all the records (except the zero node) before applying the global
 restores.
        
    1. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
        
    2. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*72)
           a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
               message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
               backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
           b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
               allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
               is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
               (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
           c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
               allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
               the transport global. 
           d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
               the components of the KIDS build.
        
    3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       ICD*18.0*72.
        
    4. When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO
        
    5. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
       
       When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
       enter:
              PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU]
    
       When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
       Order':', press enter.
    
    6. Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
       Update Transfer DRGs for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] 
       option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the appropriate 
       grouper.  This option updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF 
       records opened during the current fiscal year. The option is locked 
       with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path is PTF Menu/Update DRG 
       Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for current FY.
        
    7. All routines beginning with ICD1872* can be deleted after the patch
       has been successfully installed.
