 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD0000000295969 - DSS calculating different DRG than VistA
  
 Problem:
 ========
 VistA calculates DRG 617 incorrectly as DRG 616.
    
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine ICDTBL6A was corrected to look for secondary diagnosis identifier
 "z".
  
  
 2) HD0000000310537 - crossed over incorrect
    
 Problem:
 ========
 VistA calculates DRG 470 incorrectly as DRG 469.
    
 Solution:
 =========
 Change ICDTBL4A to look for ICDEXP to see if patient expired and change to
 non CC if it's there.
  
  
 3) HD0000000313410 - DRG Inconsistency
    
 Problem:
 ========
 Site reported that DRG 670 is calculating as 668 in VistA.
    
 Solution:
 =========
 Change table ICDTBL6A to look for z operation identifier before setting 
 to MCC.
   
  
 4) HD0000000323342 - Incorrect Crossover
   
 Problem:
 ========
 VistA calculates DRG 440 incorrectly as 439.
    
 Solution:
 =========
 Change ICDTBL4A to account for DRG codes 438, 439 and 440.
  
  
 5) HD0000000326155 - DRG's not grouping correctly in Vista
   
 Problem:
 ========
 a. DRG 841 calculating as 844 in VistA.
 b. DRG 66 calculating as 65 in VistA.  
    
 Solution:
 =========
 a. Change ICDTBL8A to look for identifier L in primary diagnosis for
    Leukemia.
 b. Change ICDTBL0A to look for Operation identifier O to determine if 
    DRG should be an MCC.
  
  
 6) HD0000000328159 - DRG calculating
       
 Problem:
 ========
 a. DRG 249 calculating incorrectly as 251 in VistA.  
 b. DRG 87 calculating incorrectly as 84 in VistA.
   
 Solution:
 =========
 a. Change IDCTBL2A to use operator '&' instead of '!' to verify fields
    at linetag CMS516 then change DRG248 to default to 249 instead
    of defaulting to a variable when checking MCC. 
 b. Change ICDTBL0A to look for identifier 1(coma>1hr) before 
    setting DRG.
  
  
 7) HD0000000328901 - DRG ungroupable 999, should be DRG 951
  
 Problem:
 ========
 DRG showing as ungroupable 999, should be DRG 951.
           
 Solution:
 =========
 Add versioned MDC and DRG to diagnosis code v66.2.
   
       
   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
   that Medical Records coders be off the system. 
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
    
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*43):
       a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the Transport Global.
       c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       ICD*18.0*43.
   
   5.  When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', respond NO.
    
   6.  When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO. 
    
   7.  All routines ICD1843* can be deleted after the patch has been
       successfully installed.  
    
   POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
   Update Transfer DRG's for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs]
   option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the appropriate
   grouper.  This should be done soon after installing the patch, but
   should be run at a time when PTF options are not in use.
        
   This option updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records
   opened during the current fiscal year.
         
   The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
   is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
   current FY.
