  DEFINITION:   Reflexologists perform a non-invasive complementary
  modality involving thumb and finger techniques to apply alternating
  pressure to the reflexes within the reflex maps of the body located on 
  the feet, hands, and outer ears. Reflexologists apply pressure
  ospecific areas (feet, hands, and ears) to promote a response from an
  area far removed from the tissue stimulated via the nervous system and 
  acupuncture meridians. Reflexologists are recommended to complete a
  minimum of 200 hours of education, typically including anatomy &
  physiology, Reflexology theory, body systems, zones, meridians &
  relaxation response, ethics, business standards, and supervised
  practicum.

  Additional Resources: Foot and hand reflexology is a scientific art
  based on the premise that there are zones and reflex areas in the feet 
  and hands which correspond to all body parts. The physical act of
  applying specific pressures using thumb, finger and hand techniques
  result in stress reduction which causes a physiological change in the
  body. Reflexology is a non-invasive, complementary modality involving
  thumb and finger techniques to apply alternating pressure to reflexes
  shown on reflex maps of the body located on the feet, hands, and outer 
  ears.
