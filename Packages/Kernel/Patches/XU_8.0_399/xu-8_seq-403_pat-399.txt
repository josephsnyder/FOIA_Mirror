Subject: Modifications to HL7 component in KIDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch Tracking #: 44896103
 Test Sites: 
   HL7 Development team; Detroit, MI; Montana, HCS; Upstate New York HCS
 Blood Bank Clearance: 12/19/06
  
 Remedy tickets:  114898, 63811, 234698
  
 HLO APPLICATION REGISTRY component:
 KIDS is enhanced to include a new component, HLO APPLICATION REGISTRY 
 (#779.2), from the newly optimized runtime (HLO) in the HL7 package.  
 This will allow the transport of HLO application entries within KIDS.
 Fix: add necessary hook code in the XPD* routines.
  
 Enhance HL LOGICAL LINK component:
 KIDS is modified to accommodate new fields in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) 
 component.
 Fix: add necessary hook code in the XPD* routines.
  
 Indian Health Services (IHS)file component:
 KIDS is enhanced to include a new component that will be available only 
 at IHS environments.
 Fix: add necessary hook code in the XPDE routine.  The actual routines 
 invoked by XPDE will be made available only at IHS sites.
  
 REMOTE MEMBERS of mail groups:
 KIDS is modified to prevent entries in the REMOTE MEMBER field of a MAIL 
 GROUP from being part of a distribution.
 Fix: add necessary hook code in the XPDTA1 routine.
  
 KIDS doesn't ask for Coordinator of existing Mail Group:
 When KIDS brings in a Mail Group, it prompts the user for the 
 Coordinator.  If the Mail Group already exists, the user can enter anyone 
 as the Coordinator, but KIDS doesn't change the Coordinator when the Mail 
 Group is installed.
 Fix: KIDS will now check if the Mail Group already exists.  If it does, 
 it will use the current Coordinator as the default for the prompt.  If 
 the user changes the default, KIDS will now overwrite the Coordinator 
 with the change.
  
 New field in the PROTOCOL file (#101):
 This patch creates a new field in the PROTOCOL file (#101) as requested 
 by the HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN (HL7) package developers.  The field is related
 to the set of fields belonging to the HL7 package, but since the Kernel
 package has ownership of file 101 it is being distributed in this 
 patch.  This new field's definition is shown below:
  
 DATA        NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA
 ELEMENT     TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 101,773.5   ACK MODE SET IN SUBSCRIBER 773;5 SET
                    
                           '1' FOR YES; 
                           '0' FOR NO; 
           LAST EDITED:    APR 17, 2007 
           HELP-PROMPT:    Enter 'Y' for 'YES' for setting the MSH-15 and 
                           MSH-16 from subscriber protocol instead of 
                           Event driver protocol. 
           DESCRIPTION:    A 'YES' of this field will indicate that MSH-15
                           and MSH-16 will be taken from Subscriber
                           protocol instead of the value(s) defined in
                           Event driver protocol.
