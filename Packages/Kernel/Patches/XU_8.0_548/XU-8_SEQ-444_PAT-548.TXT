Subject: HIPAA 5010 - NPI CROSSWALK EXTRACT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

     ****************************************************
     **  It is highly important that one reads the     **
     **  release notes BEFORE installing this patch.   **
     ****************************************************
  
 This patch contains enhancements and modifications relating to the
 XUS NPI EXTRACT REPORT [XUS NPI EXTRACT] option which is already
 loaded at the sites.  The changes contained in this patch address the
 following:
  
 1)  Create logic to pull the Organization Name and Pay-To Address that
 appear in the Pay-To Provider loop on X12 claims as viewed from the
 local facility VistA option "MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit" 
 [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS].
  
 2)  Create a field in NPI individual extract data to house the primary
 taxonomy code. The primary taxonomy code should no longer appear in the
 current taxonomy code field. The taxonomy code field should carry the
 practitioner's other taxonomy codes, if they have any.
  
 3)  Create a field in the NPI individual extract data to house the
 practitioner's current status and a second field for the date on which
 that status began.
  
 4)  Ensure that each site sends NPI Crosswalk Extract scheduling and
 execution messages to the VHA CO NPI EXTRACT MONITORING email group
 after each extract job is scheduled and subsequently run, respectively.

 ************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 There is no post installation routine associated with this patch; however
 there are several manual post-installation steps associated with this
 patch. The purpose of these instructions is to make sure that your system
 is configured properly for this NPI Crosswalk Extract so that it will run
 every time the CBO requests it via the NPI Administration web
 site.
  
 The Chief Business Office schedules an NPI Crosswalk Extract report 
 periodically (typically once a month) from all Veteran's Administration 
 provider sites.  The scheduling of this report is done via the VA NPI 
 Crosswalk Extract Administration web site using HL7 messages.  The NPI 
 Crosswalk Extract process is automated and runs in the background at each 
 site.
  
 Once the NPI Crosswalk Extract has been requested by the VA NPI Crosswalk 
 Extract Administration web site, each site responds with an 
 acknowledgement that it has received the request.  When the extract is 
 actually scheduled in TaskMan, a second acknowledgement message is sent 
 to the web site stating that the report has actually been scheduled.  
 This same process occurs when the VA NPI Crosswalk Extract Administration 
 web site cancels the extract.
  
 Finally, once the NPI Crosswalk has been run, three final messages are 
 sent.  The first message is an acknowledgement to the web site that the 
 extract was indeed run.  The second message, which is sent via Mailman, 
 is a summary message about the extract.  The final message, also sent via 
 Mailman, is the actual NPI Crosswalk Extract.
  
 For this process to work correctly several requirements must be met:
  
  
 1.  The NPI EXTRACT VERIFICATION mail group must be defined and 
     correctly configured.  The most common problem is that the REMOTE
     MEMBER address is not present or is incorrectly typed. The correct
     configuration is:
  
 NPI EXTRACT VERIFICATION
   TYPE: public                          ALLOW SELF ENROLLMENT: NO
   REFERENCE COUNT: 65                   LAST REFERENCED: JUN 01, 2010
   RESTRICTIONS: UNRESTRICTED
   MEMBER: XXXXX,XXXXXX
   DESCRIPTION: Members of this mail group will automatically receive an 
                email verification entry for each NPI Extract file that has
                been generated at the sites.
   ORGANIZER: POSTMASTER
   REMOTE MEMBER: vhaconpiextractmonitoring@VA.GOV
  
        The remote member MUST be entered exactly as shown above.

    ***                 the system correctly. It usually         ***

    This is just an example.

    *** The common mistake for the domain is that VA.GOV is not ***
    *** defined or allowed to send messages.  This is needed so ***
    *** that the remote member in Post-Installation step 1 above **
