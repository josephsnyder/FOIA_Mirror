 Remedy Ticket #: 225692
  
 Thanks to the test sites:
 - Battle Creek, MI
 - Fayetteville, AR 
 - Heartland West HCS
  
 This patch addresses the following items:
  
 1) Support for flag authorizing blanket release of provider NPI - new 
 field, Security Keys and changes to the Print Template and Options--NOTE: 
 After this field was created, a new law made it legal to release NPI 
 without the authorization of the provider. The field will remain, but 
 will be initialized to Yes (1) for all providers.
  
    a)  NEW FIELD FOR FILE 200
  A new field AUTHORIZE RELEASE OF NPI (#41.97) is added to the NEW PERSON
  file (#200). This new field is a SET OF CODES that can be set to 1 (Yes).
  If set to YES, the provider authorizes its NPI to be released to non-VA
  entities for business purposes only (ex., FEE Basis Authorizations). This
  field is initialized to 1 (Yes) for all current providers during a
  post-init of this patch.
  
  The provider's written permission to disclose the NPI must be obtained by
  the "Local NPI Maintenance Team Leader" and must be on file. (NOTE:, 
  this is no longer a business requirement)
  
    b) NEW SECURITY KEYs
  New security key XUSNPIMTL is added. The existing option XUS NPI MENU is
  locked with this key. Active users who have the option XUS NPI MENU
  assigned as either the primary or secondary menu, will be automatically
  assigned the new security key during the post-init routine for this
  patch.
  
  
 2)  Allow an entry on the NEW PERSON file (#200) to share the same active 
 NPI as an entry on the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER (#355.93) file.
 The two entries can share the same NPI value, even if their NAME fields
 are different. An entry on the INSTITUTION file (#4) cannot share an NPI
 with an entry on any other file. Two entries on the same file cannot share
 the same NPI.
  
  
 3)  Changes to CBO and Local NPI Reports. The following changes were made:
  
    a) Don't include DISUSERed users in either Local or CBO reports.
  
    b) Don't return providers Social Security Number or Date of Birth in 
  CBO output.
  
    c) Include residents in the CBO output.
  
    d) On the local reports, after the user selects whether to display all 
  practitioners or just those needing an NPI, allow a new option to display
  regular non-resident practitioners only,  residents only, or both.

  Installation Instructions
  =========================
   
  1. Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
     However, it is recommended that the patch be installed during
     non-peak time. It will take about two minutes to install the
     patch, but you may queue the installation if you wish.
   
  2. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
   
  3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
     option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   
  4. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
     You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS
     menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
   
                  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                  Print Transport Global
                  Compare Transport Global to Current System
                  Backup a Transport Global
   
     On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
     option:
                  Install Package(s)  
                  Select INSTALL NAME:XU*8.0*480
                                      ========== 
  
 Please accept default answers for the following questions:
  
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO// 
                                                  ==   
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO// 
                                                                  ==   
  
 A post-init routine XU8P480 is executed when the patch is run. It does 
 four things.
 1) Any active user who has the option XUS NPI MENU as either a Primary or 
 Secondary menu option, will be assigned new security key XUSNPIMTL that 
 comes with this patch.
 2) The existing menu item XUS NPI MENU is locked with the new key 
 XUSNPIMTL
 3) The new field on file 200 AUTHORIZE BLANKET RELEASE OF NPI is 
 initialized to 1 (Yes) for all providers who have an NPI.
 4) The temporary list of provider taxonomies normally denoting those
 providers who would have an NPI is killed and rebuilt to add a new
 taxonomy to the list. (^XTMP("NPIVALS"))
  
 NOTE: The post-init routine XU8P480 can safely be deleted by IRM after the
 patch has been installed.
