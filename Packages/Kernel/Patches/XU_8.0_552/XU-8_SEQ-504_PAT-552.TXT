Subject: FIXCOPY OF KEYS IN XQSMDCPY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This kernel patch fixes a problem found while using the option Copy One 
 Users Menus and Keys to others [XQSMD COPY USER] to copy user menus/keys
 from one user to another.  It may not copy all of the keys to the 'copy
 to' user that are assigned to the 'copy from' user when the person who is
 doing the copy is not assigned the XUMGR key, even though the keys to be
 copied are assigned to this user performing the action.  The problem is
 being caused by a typo in the routine XQSMDCPY.  There is a line of code
 where the SECURITY KEY file (#19.1) should be checked for existence of the
 key's internal entry number but the OPTION file (#19) is referenced
 instead.  So, unless the internal entry number of the SECURITY KEY (#19.1)
 file entry is defined in the OPTION file (#19), the key is ignored and not
 copied.

 1. INC0000000413806 Problem with copy user menus/keys
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When using the option Copy One Users Menus and Keys to others [XQSMD COPY 
 USER], all user keys are not being copied when the user executing the 
 option does not have the XUMGR security key, even if the user executing 
 the option is assigned these keys and is authorized to delegate them.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The problem is being caused by a typo in the routine XQSMDCPY.  There is 
 a line of code where the SECURITY KEY file (#19.1) should be checked for 
 existence of the key's internal entry number in the SECURITY KEY file 
 (#19.1), but instead the OPTION file (#19) is referenced.  So, unless the 
 internal entry number of the SECURITY KEY (#19.1) file entry is defined 
 in the OPTION file (#19), the key is ignored and not copied.  Fix the 
 typographical error.
