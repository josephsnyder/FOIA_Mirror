Subject: API to return date/time patch installed

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch adds a new API to the routine XPDUTL. This enhancement was
  requested by the GMRV developers to help them repair some records that
  were corrupted after a patch was installed.
  
 The extrinsic function, INSTALDT is used to populate the RESULT array with a
  list of install date/times for a given INSTALL name. The function will return
  the number of records in the RESULT array.
  
  $$INSTALDT^XPDUTL(INSTALL, .RESULT) returns the number of records in the
   passed by reference RESULT array.
   Input: INSTALL = name of install in the INSTALL file, 9.7
          RESULT = variable passed by reference
   Output: number of records in the RESULT array
           RESULT = number of records
           RESULT(internal date/time) = TEST# ^ SEQ#
  
 Example:
 =======
 1.      Install a patch using the KIDS options.
 2.      Enter programmer mode.
 3.      At the programmer prompt, enter the following M code:
  
 ISC>W $$INSTALDT^XPDUTL("XU*8.0*491",.RESULT)

 ISC>ZW RESULT 
 RESULT=3
 RESULT(3080417.124045)="2^"
 RESULT(3080421.150338)=""
 RESULT(3080924.113524)="6^"
