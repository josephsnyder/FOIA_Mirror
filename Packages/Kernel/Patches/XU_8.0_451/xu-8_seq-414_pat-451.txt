  This software release fixes a defect in a security software tool
  that is used by J2EE Web-based HealtheVet VistA applications
  to perform a login to the end user's local Legacy VistA system
  via Kernel Security.  This tool is known as Kernel Authentication
  and Authorization for J2EE (KAAJEE).  The custodian package
  of KAAJEE is Kernel.
  
  VA Facilities (VAMCs) are expected to install the M-side componentSubj: Released XU*8*451 SEQ #414  [#42336]   Page 3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  as this only brings in a single Security Key(No routines included)
  needed for the KAAJEE Sample Web Application (Standalone test harness).
  
  M KIDS Components: Security Key  XUKAAJEE_SAMPLE
  ==================
      
  VA Facilities are not expected to install the Java-side components
  unless they have their own J2EE Application Server(s)
  (e.g.:  BEA WebLogic Server) and managed them as well as develop
  their own local J2EE web-based applications.
  
  Summary of issues addressed:
  
  *  Remove Refresh button from KAAJEE login page.
  
  *  Add JavaScript code for client-side sorting of Institutions.
  
  *  Fix Response already committed error--The code that was fixed
     was associated with processing the persistent cookie information
     on the Application Server.  This fix should also fix the extra
     M process that was created.Subj: Released XU*8*451 SEQ #414  [#42336]   Page 4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  *  Make KAAJEE Login Page more Section 508 friendlier.
  
  *  Allow Access code ; Verify code in one line.
  
  *  Provide MD5 checksums on all deployable artifacts.
  
  *  Compiled and tested KAAJEE against SDS 13.0
  
  *  Compiled and tested KAAJEE against VistaLink 1.5.1.002.
  
  *  Support parameter passing of Default Institution and Institution
     sorting preferences.  This addresses the issues of persistent cookies
     when using Thin Clients and Terminal Servers.
  
  *  Provide KAAJEE Sample Web Application.
  
  Kernel Authentication and Authorization for J2EE (KAAJEE) is used by 
  several HealtheVet-VistA applications (e.g.:  Blind Rehabilitation,
  Veterans Personal Finance System(VPFS), Clinical Data Repository Health Data
  Repository(CHDR), etc.) to provide authentication and authorization services.Subj: Released XU*8*451 SEQ #414  [#42336]   Page 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The login page that KAAJEE provides utilizes two buttons.  One of these
  is 'Refresh' and the other is 'Login'.
  
  The 'Refresh' button is used in conjunction with the 'Sort by Station 
  Number' and 'Sort by Station Name' radio buttons to initiate a change in 
  the sorting of institutions displayed in the Institution drop down 
  component.  The actual sorting occurs on the Application Server side only 
  after the login user presses the 'Refresh' button.
  
  The problem with the 'Refresh' button is that it resets the 'Access code' 
  and 'Verify code' fields to blank.  In addition, the selected institution 
  in the Institution Drop down component is reset to the default value.  
  Furthermore, the '<enter>' key defaults to the 'Refresh' button instead of 
  the 'Login' button. This causes a problem as many users are accustomed to
  pressing the <enter> key immediately after entering in their verify
  code.  Instead of logging in the user as the user had intended, the login 
  page is refreshed and the user is unaware of the changes that just 
  occurred.  This eventually causes problems when the user does finally
  press the 'Login' button and the login attempt fails.  Additionally, 
  the 'Refresh' causes an M process to be created that may 
  further contribute to the login attempt problems that users areSubj: Released XU*8*451 SEQ #414  [#42336]   Page 6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  experiencing.
  
  This patch fixes this problem by removing the 'Refresh' button from the 
  login page.  In its place, JavaScript will be used in conjunction with 
  the existing radio buttons to change the sorting of institutions.  The 
  actual sorting will now occur on the client instead of the server.  In 
  addition, the 'Access code' and 'Verify code' fields will no longer need 
  to be reset.  Also, the <enter> key will default to the 'Login' button.
  
  Another issue that causes some problems with the login is that some users
  are accustomed to entering both their access code and verify code separated
  by a semicolon (';') in a single line.  This patch addresses this issue
  by permitting both the <Access Code> and <Verify Code> to be entered in the
  'Access Code' text box of the KAAJEE login page.
  
  In order to test the KAAJEE login, you need to deploy a consuming
  J2EE Web Application that is configured to use KAAJEE.  Therefore,
  this patch provides a standalone KAAJEE Sample Web Application
  that may be used to test KAAJEE.  In addition, this can be used
  by J2EE developers as a sample to assist them in configuring their
  J2EE web-based application to use KAAJEE.  Therefore, thisSubj: Released XU*8*451 SEQ #414  [#42336]   Page 7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  sample web application can be used by web administrators, SQA,
  Testing Services, J2EE developers and support personnel.
  
  Parameter passing of Default Institution and Institution
  sorting preferences is now supported with this patch.
  When the consuming application provides a web URL link
  to their protected web pages, they can now include a list
  of KAAJEE supported parameters.  In addition, each login user can create
  shortcuts to these links on their desktops.  The login user can then edit
  these shortcuts to include the desired parameters and corresponding values.
  The use of these shortcuts can be used as a workaround to the issue
  of using persistent cookies when using Thin Clients and Terminal Servers.
  The issue of using persistent cookies on Terminal Servers is that they
  are often not retained as part of the roaming user profile upon logout
  and disconnect.
  
  Below is a list of possible parameters that may be appended to the URL
  of the consuming application's protected page:
  
  kaajeeDefaultInstitution=###
  Subj: Released XU*8*451 SEQ #414  [#42336]   Page 8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  kaajeeDisableInstitutionComponents=true
  
  kaajeeSortStationBy=number
  
  kaajeeDisableSortStationBy=true
  
  Note, that the ### listed above should be replaced with the actual station
  number.  Also, the kaajeeSortStationBy parameter can have a value
  of either 'number' or 'name'.  All parameter names and values
  are case sensitive.
