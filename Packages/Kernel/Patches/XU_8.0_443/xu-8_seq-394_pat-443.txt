  This patch fixes several problems identified with alerts and includes fixes 
  which were originally addressed in patches XU*8*362 and XU*8*364 which never 
  got enough test sites.
   
  This patch addresses a problem when a user had a surrogate which somehow had 
  the original user also specified as a surrogate.  This could result in a
  Frame-Stack error.  It also addresses a potential NO LINE error.
   
  Users can not select a disabled users as a surrogate (and if a surrogate 
  shows up as a disabled user, the surrogate relationship will be 
  terminated).
   
  XQALMAKE can be used to generate a long text information only alert, and in
  the roll and scroll environment, this is flagged with an 'L' instead of an
  'I'.
   
  Comments to forwarded alerts are returned as the third '^'-piece from calls 
  to USER^XQALERT and PATIENT^XQALERT.
   
  Protection was added to prevent undefined errors in KILLARCH+4^XQALDEL.
   
   
  Incorporated from patch XU*8*362:
   
    This patch corrects problems identified with sending alerts to mail groups 
    and mail groups referenced within mail groups.  
   
    There was a problem with sending to mail groups which contained lower case 
    characters in their names.  
   
    There was a problem with sending to more than one mail group referenced by
    a mail group (alerts were forwarded to the first mail group, but not to 
    others referenced by the same mail group).  
   
    There was the potential for an endless loop by cyclic reference among mail 
    groups.
    
  Incorporated from patch XU*8*364:
   
    This patch fixes a problem where non-queued printing of the data to 
    another device is sent instead to the console screen when users used the 
    options [XQAL ALERT LIST FROM DATE or XQAL PATIENT ALERT LIST]. The 
    problem has been reported in NOIS MAC-1004-60560.  
   
   Blood Bank Team Coordination: 
   =============================
  
   EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*443 contains 
   changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
   VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
   not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
   safety critical elements functions.
  
   RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*443 have no effect on Blood 
   Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
    
   Installation Instructions: 
   ==========================
    
   1. The patch should be loaded during very light usage times or
      with the users off the system.  The concern is the possibility
      of erroring out a process that is involved in sending an alert.
      This is unlikely to occur when usage is very light, but can be
      insured only if users are not on the system during the installation. 
      It will take about one minute to install the patch, but 
      you may queue the installation if you wish.  
    
   2. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.  
    
   3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
    
   4. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
      You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS 
      menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options: 
    
                   Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
                   Print Transport Global 
                   Compare Transport Global to Current System 
                   Backup a Transport Global 
    
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
      option: 
        Install Package(s)  
        Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*443 
                             ==========
 Please accept default for these questions.       
  
      Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
