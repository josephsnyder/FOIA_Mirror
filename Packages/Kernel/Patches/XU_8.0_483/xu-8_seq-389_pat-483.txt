Description:
============

 Patch XU*8*483 (ANALYSIS OF 'OR CPRS GUI CHART' DISTRIBUTION) 
  
 Remedy Ticket: None 
  
 Test Sites: 
   Fayettville, AR
   Little Rock, AR 
   Salisbury, NC 
  
 Please note that this patch should be installed manually since entries
 will need to be made to identify the Facility Information Security Officer
 (ISO) and Chief Information Officer (CIO).  These entries will be used to
 address local messages which will be sent to the ISO and the CIO.
  
 The patch will install a new SERVER type option CPRS GUI CHART
 DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS [XQOCGCANALYSIS] which will run the routine XQ55SPEC
 when a message is sent to S.XQOCGCANALYSIS at the site.
  
 Installation of the patch will run a post install routine (XU8P483) which
 will require the installer to enter active users for the two new
 fields in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file, it will then run the routine
 XQ55SPEC to generate an initial analysis.
  
 If the routine XQ55SPEC is run and there are no entries in the new fields 
 in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (e.g., by an automated install), a
 message indicating this will be sent to G.PATCH and G.PATCHES at the site,
 and another message will be sent to the external mail addresses indicating
 this as well.
  
 One mail message generated by XQ55SPEC will be a summary sent to a mail 
 group associated with OI&T Field Operations and to the FACILITY ISO and
 CIO. This mail message will provide the number of entries in the NEW
 PERSON file with access to the OR CPRS GUI CHART option, and the total
 number of active entries in the file.  It will also list the different
 option pathways which have been identified for the users and the number of
 users associated with each of these pathways [the total for these numbers
 will be greater than the total number of users, due to some users having
 multiple pathways].  
  
 The other mail message generated by XQ55SPEC will only be sent to the
 FACILITY ISO and CIO and will contain the same information as the Summary
 message followed by a list of all active entries in the NEW PERSON file
 that can access the OR CPRS GUI CHART menu option. For each user, this
 list will show the primary menu option, the last date signed on, and
 indicate the menu path(s) by which the user can access the OR CPRS GUI
 CHART option (including via secondary or common menus) by number.
  
 If the option OR CPRS GUI CHART does not exist on the system, an ERROR 
 message indicating this will be sent instead of the two messages described
 above.  
  
 DD Changes:
 The patch will add two new fields to the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file
 (#8989.3)for FACILITY ISO (#321.01) and FACILITY CIO (#321.02).
