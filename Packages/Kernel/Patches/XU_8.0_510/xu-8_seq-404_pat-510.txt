Subject: THE CASE OF THE DISAPPEARING X

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch replaces an entered-in-error patch, XU*8*482.
  
 This patch fixes a problem noted in Remedy ticket #63169, which started life
 as NOIS LIT-1100-72386. It made a very important variable 'X' disappear,
 causing much consternation to all that came in contact with it.
  
 In particular, an undefined occurs in the option Limited File Manager Options
 (Build) [XQSMD LIMITED FM OPTIONS] when Inquire option type is chosen and no
 Print Template is entered. This patch fixes that.
  
 This patch also lets users create options in the A* namespace using either
 XQSMD LIMITED FM OPTIONS or the option Build a New Menu [XQSMD BUILD MENU]
 without adding a Z to the end of the namespace. The help text and description
 of the applicable field in the NEW PERSON file have been updated to reflect
 the change.
  
 Options affected:
 XQSMD BUILD MENU
 XQSMD LIMITED FM OPTIONS

              HELP-PROMPT:      Enter locally assigned name space, e.g. AFS 
                                (preferred), or a package namespace, e.g. LR 
                                to which the user must add a Z, e.g. LRZ. 
              DESCRIPTION:      This menu prefix, used by the delegate to
                                create local options, can be in one of two
                                forms: An assigned local namespace beginning 
                                with the letter "A", such as A6A (preferred),
                                or a package namespace, such as LR to which
                                the user must add the letter "Z", .e.g. LRZ 
                                (discouraged) to avoid conflict with national
                                releases.
