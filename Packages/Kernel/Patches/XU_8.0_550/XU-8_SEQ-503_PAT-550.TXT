 Installation Instructions and Software Retrieval
 ================================================
 - There are no options that need to be disabled.
 - Users may remain on the system.
 - This patch should NOT be installed while the RUM Background Driver
    [KMPR BACKGROUND DRIVER] option is running (this job is queued to run
    every day, usually at 1 a.m.).
 - Make sure no other patch is being installed at the same time.
 - TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped or put in a wait state.
 - Installation should take less than 2 minutes.
  
  
 1. Retrieve the host file from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
    the OI Field Offices.  The preferred method is to FTP the file from
    DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which will transmit the file from the first
    available server.  Alternatively, sites may elect to retrieve the file
    from a specific OI Field Office.
  
    OI FIELD OFFICE     FTP ADDRESS                    DIRECTORY
    Albany              FTP.FO-ALBANY.DOMAIN.EXT       anonymous.software
    Hines               FTP.FO-HINES.DOMAIN.EXT        anonymous.software
    Salt Lake City      FTP.FO-SLC.DOMAIN.EXT          anonymous.software
  
    The software distribution includes:
  
  FILE NAME             DESCRIPTION           BLOCK SIZE
  
 XU_8_550_V1.KID            KIDS Build           606 blocks
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation Menu.  From this menu, select the option Load a 
    Distribution and select XU_8_550_v1.KID. KIDS will load both patches
    from the host file.
  
  
 3. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following option.
    When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch XU*8.0*550:
                                                  **********
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
  
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install XU*8*550.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//'     
  
         There are no menus involved, so menu trees do not need to be 
         rebuilt.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//'
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO// 
  
         Options, menu  options, or protocols  do not need to be disabled.
  
 8.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
