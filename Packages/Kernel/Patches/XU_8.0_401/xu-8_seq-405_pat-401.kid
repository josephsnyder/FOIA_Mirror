This new-style cross-reference has as cross-reference values all the 
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,2,0)
fields in the NEW PERSON file that are being tracked by the Office of 
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,3,0)
Academic Affiliations for rollup into a centralized database. When any of
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,4,0)
the fields are edited, the cross-reference logic will set an index entry
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,5,0)
that corresponds to the edited record. The index entries will look like
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,6,0)
this:
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,7,0)
 
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,8,0)
  ^VA(200,"ATR",ien) = FM internal date
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,9,0)
 
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,10,0)
"ATR" stands for "ATRainee." 
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,11,0)
 
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,12,0)
None of the field-type cross-reference values are used as subscripts in
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,13,0)
the index, since we are only interested in recording the IENs of the
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,14,0)
records that are edited and the date the index entry is set. A separate
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,15,0)
queuable option will loop through the entries in this index, and send via
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,16,0)
HL7 messages the clinical trainee data of each record to the Office of
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,17,0)
Academic Affiliations.
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,18,0)
 
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,19,0)
Note that the index will only be set if the person is a Clinical Trainee,
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,20,0)
that is, if the PROGRAM OF STUDY (#12.2) field is filled in.
