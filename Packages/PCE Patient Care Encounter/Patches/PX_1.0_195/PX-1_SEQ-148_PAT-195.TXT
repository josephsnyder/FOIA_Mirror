Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem where some Diagnosis Codes cannot be
 selected for entries prior to their deactivation date when updating the
 International Classification of Diseases--9th edition (ICD9)  Diagnosis

 (PCE) package.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000303732 - Site is not able to enter Code 788.9 for DOS of
                      10/5/07
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site reported that some Diagnosis Codes cannot be selected for   
    entries prior to their deactivation date when updating the 
    International Classification of Diseases--9th edition (ICD9)
    Diagnosis in Patient Care Encounter (PCE).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PXCEAE was modified to include the date of service for the 
    encounter when validating the status of the Diagnosis Code.
  
  
 2) HD0000000127261 - Correct the CREATED BY USER field description of the
                      VISIT (#9000010) file to reflect current
                      functionality.
    Duplicate:
    HD0000000189650 - DUZ on Visit, V-files affected by logical link 
                      restart
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site reported that the Information Resource Management (IRM) person's
    name was appearing in the VISIT (#9000010) file when restarting an HL7
    link.  This is incorrect according to the Patient Care Encounter (PCE)
    Technical Manual. The Internal Entry Number (IEN, commonly referred to
    as a DUZ) should be passed in by the application that calls the PCE
    Application Program Interface (API) that creates or updates the
    visit or it defaults to the DUZ at the time the entry was created or
    updated if no DUZ is passed in, or if something other than the API
    is used to create or update the entry. In other words, if USER is not
    defined, DUZ will be used and stored in the CREATED BY USER (#.23)
    field in the VISIT (#9000010) file.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The field description of the CREATED BY USER (#.23) field in the VISIT
    (#9000010) file was changed to reflect current functionality. 
  
    In addition, this change is in accordance with the USER parameter
    that corresponds to the CREATED BY USER (#.23) field in the VISIT 
    (#9000010) file.  This parameter description is under the PCE API
    $$DATA2PCE^PXAPI (DBIA# 1889) section of the Patient Care Encounter
    (PCE) V. 1.0 Technical Manual and Visit Tracking V. 2.0 Technical
    Manual, August 1996, Revised March 2009.
