 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1) HD250502 - SEQ NUMBERS not working for EDUC SUBTOPIC (order of display)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site reported that the sequence numbers for the Education Subtopic
    are out of order when running the Active Educ. Topic List - Detailed
    [PXTT LIST ACTIVE EDUC TOPICS] option.
  
    Resolution:

    a new routine PXTTEDL that lists the sequence numbers of the Subtopic
    in order.
  
 2) HD250503 - Word wrap problem in Active Educ. Topic List - Detailed
    [PXTT LIST ACTIVE EDUC TOPICS] option
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site reported that wrapping problems occur when running the 
    Active Educ. Topic List - Detailed [PXTT LIST ACTIVE EDUC TOPICS]
    option.  This is due to the Goals and Standards line headings and text
    indentation causes the text to wrap unexpectedly.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Print Template PXTT EDUCATION TOPICS-DETAILED was modified to print
    all the Goals and Standards of the Education Topics starting from
    column 1. Also, the text labels for Goals and Standards are moved onto
    their own line.
