  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: The implementation of EVC R2 at all sites is an EMERGENCY RELEASE 
 24-hour compliance and scheduled for installation on Saturday March 28,
 2009. Therefore, the compliance date to have this patch installed at all
 sites is no later than Sunday March 29, 2009 by 8 am EST. Failure to 
 install this patch within this timeframe may result in corrupting data or
 missing data at the facilities.
 **************************************************************************
  
 The Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) project is being undertaken to support 
 technology and business changes that are occurring with the implementation
 of the HEC Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) project.  Some modified and
 new business functionality is being included in the new system and
 corresponding changes are necessary in VistA for preliminary determination
 of veterans Enrollment and Eligibility status. The EVC project has been
 rolled out in three phases.  This release represents the third and last
 phase or EVC Release 2.
  
 This patch distributes the changes to PATIENT CARE ENCOUNTER (PCE) in 
 support of the this initiative.  It will be released with patches 
 SD*5.3*441 & DG*5.3*664 as a single host file, SD_53_P441.KID
  
 This patch is being released with an EMERGENCY priority, along with host
 file DG_53_P688.KID, RA*5*70, and LR*5.2*352. There is a potential risk of
 data corruption if the installations are not coordinated.
  
 The installation order for all EVC R2 patches are as follows:
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 DG hostfile DG_53_P688.KID  (DG*5.3*688, IVM*2*115 & EAS*1*70)
 SD hostfile SD_53_P441.KID (SD*5.3*441, DG*5.3*664 & PX*1*168)
 Radiology (RA*5*70)
 Laboratory (LR*5*352)
 --------------------------------------------------------------
  
 The following enhancements are implemented in this patch, PX*1.0*168:
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 I. Product Features
    ----------------
    A. Ability to process Project 112/SHAD Exposure through PCE.
  
       1. New Classification created for Project 112/SHAD - Providers will
          be able to identify whether care provided to a veteran is for a
          condition related to Project 112/SHAD.  The same manner as
          identification of other exposure related care will be used; e.g.
          Service Connected, Agent Orange, etc. 
  
   
    B. Replace Persian Gulf Exposure with SW Asia Conditions Exposure.
  
       1. The field (#80004) titled PERSIAN GULF EXPOSURE of the VISIT File
          (#9000010) and V POV file (#9000010.07) has been changed to SW
          ASIA CONDITIONS.
   
    C. Update to Agent Orange exposure.
       1. Agent Orange Indicator has been modified to return true only when
          veteran is Agent Orange exposed and Agent Orange location is
          Vietnam.
     
 II. Functional Changes
     ------------------
     A. A new prompt, 'Was treatment related to PROJ 112/SHAD?' has been 
        Added to the current classification prompts within the PCE
        Encounter Data Entry options and the ADD STANDALONE ENC and the
        UPDATE ENCOUNTER actions on the Encounter List screen.
   
     B. The classification, 'Environmental Contaminants' has been renamed
        'SW Asia Conditions'.  The question asked will be replaced with: 
        "Was treatment related to service in SW Asia?".
   
           --- Classification --- [Required]
           Was treatment for SC Condition?
           Was treatment related to Combat?
           Was treatment related to Agent Orange Exposure?
           Was treatment related to Ionizing Radiation Exposure?
           Was treatment related to service in SW Asia?
           Was treatment related to PROJ 112/SHAD?
           Was treatment related to Military Sexual Trauma?
           Was treatment related to Head and/or Neck Cancer?
   
     C. The protocol PXCE ADD/EDIT DISPLAY DETAIL (Display Detail) will now
        display the Project 112/SHAD value.
