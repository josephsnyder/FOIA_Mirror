 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD176891 - Change DISPLAY ON HEALTH SUMMARY (#.08) field in
                Health Factors file to a required field
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Health Summary patch GMTS*2.7*82 will make use of DISPLAY ON 
     HEALTH SUMMARY (#.08) field of the HEALTH FACTORS (#9999999.64) 
     file.  Often, this field is null.  It has been requested that this 
     be changed to a required field to help remove any ambiguity about
     whether certain Health Factors display on a Health Summary report.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Change the Data Dictionary for the HEALTH FACTORS (#9999999.64)
     file so that the DISPLAY ON HEALTH SUMMARY (#.08) field is now a
     required field.  This patch will also include post-init routine
     PX10P185 which will read through the HEALTH FACTORS (#9999999.64)
     file and update any records where DISPLAY ON HEALTH SUMMARY (#.08) 
     field is null to 'Y'.
  
 2)  HD176895 - Warning message for PCE Health Factors
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Currently, when a user updates an encounter and adds a new Health
     Factor for the encounter via PCE Encounter Data Entry they are
     unaware whether or not that Health Factor will display on a Health
     Summary report.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine PXCEVFI1 will be modified so that a warning message is dis-
     played to the user whenever they enter a Health Factor that contains
     an 'N' (No) in DISPLAY ON HEALTH SUMMARY (#.08) field of the HEALTH
     FACTORS (#9999999.64) file.  The warning message will display as
     follows:
  
     WARNING:  This Health Factor is currently not set to
               display on a Health Summary report.
