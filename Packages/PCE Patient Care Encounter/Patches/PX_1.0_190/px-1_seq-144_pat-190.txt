 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD 201674 - AUPNSICD+6^AUPNSICD
  
    Problem:
    --------
    An <UNDEFINED> variable error occurs when the FileMan ENTER OR EDIT
    FILE ENTRIES option is used to edit a POV code.
  
    Currently, variable PXCEVIEN is not defined in the routine AUPNSICD.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine AUPNSICD has been modified to insure the variable PXCEVIEN is
    defined.
  
 2. HD 199972 - $ZE=<SUBSCRIPT>XXX+2^PXBGCPT2
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A <SUBSCRIPT> error occurs when the CPT code contains a long string of
    ASCII control characters. User was in Appointment Management [SDAM
    APPT MGT] option, going through the checkout process and was prompted
    for a CPT code. At the 'Enter PROCEDURE (CPT CODE): ' prompt, the user
    input "99456" but then pressed the <Tab> key long enough to
    fill up about a screen, then hit <Enter> key.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PXBPCPT has been modified to guard against the above error.
