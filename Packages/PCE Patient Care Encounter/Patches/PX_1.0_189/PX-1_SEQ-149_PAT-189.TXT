Subject: PCE PROVIDER ENCOUNTER COUNTS & CASELOAD PROFILE BY CLINIC REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three issues:
 1. Changes the existing code for the Caseload Profile by Clinic [PXRR
 CASELOAD PROFILE BY CL] report by removing the existing direct global read
 so that data will be pulled from the PXRMINDX index.
  
 2. Modifies the report logic that displays historical encounters with no
 LOC. OF ENCOUNTER (#.06) field populated in the VISIT (#9000010) file when
 running the Provider Encounter Counts [PXRR PROVIDER ENCOUNTER COUNTS]
 report and selecting Service Category "EVENT (HISTORICAL)". It returns
 very few or no encounters. The fix for the historical encounters that
 occurred at Non-VA sites will be included as well.
  
 3. Fixes the letter 'O' being displayed after accepting the default value
 "N" from a prompt when running the Provider Encounter Counts [PXRR
 PROVIDER ENCOUNTER COUNTS] report.  (The display should show "NO".)

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD0000000245063 - Need to remove direct global read and use PXRMINDX
                       index
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Hines OIFO is currently developing a new package called CLINICAL
     OBSERVATIONS (CliO) which will collect additional patient information.
     It will also collect existing information such as patient vital
     signs/measurements (e.g., blood pressure).  CliO will not be storing
     patient vitals data in the GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT (#120.5) file.
     Instead, CliO will update the Clinical Reminders index (i.e.,
     '^PXRMINDX(120.5,').  The Vitals package also updates the PXRMINDX
     index whenever a patient's vital signs/measurements are taken.  The
     Clinical Reminders package uses this index to quickly find the vitals
     data it needs to resolve patient reminders.  This index is similar to
     the Vitals package cross-reference ('^GMR(120.5,"AA",') that Vitals
     and CPRS currently use to find patient records.
     
     Hines OIFO is working on modifying the existing Vitals APIs to use
     the PXRMINDX index so the existing APIs will continue to work without
     any difference to where the record is stored. Since Caseload Profile 
     by Clinic [PXRR CASELOAD PROFILE BY CL] report is doing a direct
     global read of GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT (#120.5) file, it is important
     that the applicable routine be changed to use the PXRMINDX index.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine PXRRPCE5 will be modified to remove the existing direct global
     read of GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT (#120.5) file and change it to pull
     data from the PXRMINDX index.
  
  
 2)  HD0000000114258 - No Encounters Returned
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When running the Provider Encounter Counts [PXRR PROVIDER ENCOUNTER 
     COUNTS] report and selecting Service Category "EVENT (HISTORICAL)",
     it returns very few or no encounters.
  
     Also, when running the above report, the historical encounters that 
     have occurred at non-VA sites are not being included in the report.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine PXRRECSE to use Hospital Location to get the facility
     to match the selected facility for the report since historical
     encounters do not populate the LOC. OF ENCOUNTER (#.06) file in the
     VISIT (#9000010) file if it is created via CPRS GUI.
  
     Moreover, this facility will not be stored in the LOC. OF ENCOUNTER 
     (#.06) field in the VISIT (#9000010) file. It is just for reporting
     purposes. The name of the facility will be displayed on the report 
     if the encounter occurred at VA site.
  
     Routine PXRRPRSP and PXRRPRDP have been modified to make sure the 
     encounters that occurred at non-VA sites are included in both 
     Provider Encounter Counts summary and detail reports.
  
  
 3)  HD0000000276146 - 'O' displayed after accepting default value N
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When running the PCE Provider Encounter Counts [PXRR PROVIDER 
     ENCOUNTER COUNTS] report, the system issues the following prompt: Do
     you want to display encounters at Non-VA sites ? N//
     When the user accepts this default value 'N', the letter 'O' is
     displayed.  For example, Do you want to display encounters at Non-VA
     sites ? N//  O. This 'O' will be corrected to display as "NO".
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     When using FileMan API call DIR, variable DIR("B") to provide a
     default response; routine PXRRLCSC has been modified to set
     DIR("B")="NO" so that when the user presses the Enter/Return key to
     accept the default, the default response 'NO' would not be displayed.
