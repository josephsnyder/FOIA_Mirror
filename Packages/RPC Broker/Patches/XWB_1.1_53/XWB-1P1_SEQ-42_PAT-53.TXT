Description:
============

                 Patch XWB*1.1*53 Broker Security Update
                  (must be installed prior to XU*8*523)
  
 WARNING: You probably should install this and companion patch XU*8*523 
 when users are off the system.  The routines involved are at the heart of
 the RPCBroker processing, and any users on at the time they are installed
 will receive an EDITED error, and could lose work they are involved in.  
 If you are unable to get all of the RPCBroker users off of the system,
 then install them with as few users on the system as possible.

 Blood Bank Team Coordination: 
 =============================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XWB*1.1*53 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XWB*1.1*53 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 In preparation for the final stage of the Broker Security Enhancement,
 this patch, in conjunction with XU*8*523, adds for imaging and other
 similar applications that authenticate at the user's home site instead of
 a national site, the ability for remote visitor applications to
 authenticate the users at the user's sites, with call back from the
 visited site to the authenticating station based on the station number for
 the authenticating site.
  
 This patch adds the XUS SET VISITOR Remote Procedure to those that do not
 require inclusion in a context option.  Thus, any application can call 
 these as necessary without including them in the current context option.
  
 The patch also updates the BSECALL functionality in XWBTCPM2 to provide a
 second connection attempt if the first attempt fails and it is based on 
 station number.
  
  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
   
  1. Since XWBSEC is included in the updated routines, any program connected 
     with RPCBroker is likely to have an error on a Remote Procedure call due 
     to changing this routine.  The patch should be installed when the system 
     has minimal GUI application usage or when the users are off the system.
   
  2. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.  
   
  3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
     option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
   
  4. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
     You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS 
     menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options: 
   
                  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
                  Print Transport Global 
                  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
                  Backup a Transport Global 
   
     On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
     option:
