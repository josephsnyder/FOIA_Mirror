Description:
============

 This patch resolves two issues reported in two Remedy Tickets.
 
 1) Danville reported that when the user performed an inquiry on
    the CP TRANSACTION file (#702) using File Manager, the procedures
    on the display from the query do not match the actual procedure
    in the CP DEFINITION field (#.04) of the record.  Example of the issue is
    given below.

    The identifier in the CP TRANSACTION file (#702) for the CREATED BY
    field (#.03) was bad.  This patch will remove the bad identifier and
    add a new identifier for the CP DEFINITION field (#.04) for the file.
 
    (RT# 238063)
 
 
 2) Poplar Bluff reported that the results from their device are not matched
    to the Clinical Procedure studies and the status of the studies do not
    update from "Pending Instrument Data" to "Complete".  This issue was
    caused by the study reference number not being returned correctly to
    match against the result.  Routine MDRPCOR was modified to correct
    this problem.
                  
    (RT# 248784)
                                                                  
                                                                          
 NOTE: MDPOST17 is a post-init routine that removed a bad identifier in the
       CP TRANSACTION file (#702).  This routine will be removed after
       installation.
