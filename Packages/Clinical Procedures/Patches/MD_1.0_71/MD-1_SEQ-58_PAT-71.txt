 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5197946 - CP User GUI Spelling Error
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In CP User, when navigating to File > Check-In New Study, the screen 
 includes a tab for "Outpatient Visits". The spelling is incorrect (missing
 the letter 't'); instead, "Oupatient Visits" is displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The missing 't' has been added to correct the spelling.
  
 2. INC6247495 - Help file Issue CP User
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In CP User, when selecting Home from the Options menu in the Clinical 
 Procedures User help file, an error ("This page can't be displayed") 
 occurs due to there being no Home link defined in the file.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The valid Home link has been defined in the .CHM file.
  
 3. INC6050047 - CP User GUI - Cursor not positioned in the "Select 
 patient:" location when the box opens to select a patient
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When selecting a patient in CP User, the cursor is not automatically 
 positioned in the "Select patient:" location; instead, the user must
 manually click in the text box before he or she can type a patient's name.
 This applies to when the user first opens a patient and when the user
 changes patients in the same session.
  
 In other words, when the patient selection screen is loaded, the
 cursor/focus is not in the "Enter Patient Name or Last Initial and Last 4
 of SSN:" text box.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The form has been updated so that when it is loaded, the cursor is 
 positioned in the "Enter Patient Name or Last Initial and Last 4 of SSN:"
 text box ready for typing.
  
 4. INC6053290 - CP User GUI - Switching patients need a clear box to allow
    user to enter fresh patient information
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When switching patients via the patient lookup option in CP User, the
 Patient Lookup screen displays the information for the patient that was
 selected before.
  
 In other words, when the patient selection screen is loaded, if a previous
 search was completed, the information is not cleared from the text entry
 box nor the display list. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The form has been updated so that when it is loaded, any previous search 
 information (including patient text and/or list results) is cleared. 
  
 5. INC6547848 - Patient lookup options (Clinic, Team and Ward) need to 
    match the lookup option for Patient
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When switching patients via the Clinic, Team or Ward lookup options in CP
 User, the Patient Lookup screen displays the information for the previous
 search/selection.
  
 In other words, when the patient selection screen is loaded, if a previous
 search was completed, the information is not cleared from the text entry
 box nor the display lists.
  
 Also, the cursor is not automatically positioned in the "Select 
 Clinic:/Team:/Ward:" text box.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The form has been updated so that when it is loaded, any previous search 
 information (including clinic, team or ward text, selections and/or list
 results) is cleared, and the cursor is positioned in the "Select 
 Clinic:/Team:/Ward:" text box ready for typing.
