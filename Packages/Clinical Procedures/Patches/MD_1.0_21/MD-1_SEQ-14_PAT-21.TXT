 This patch contains the enhancement that will help streamline
 Clinical Procedures (CP) application processes for high volume procedures,
 such as electrocardiograms (EKG).
 
 It will accomplish the following:
 1) Create an Application Proxy called CLINICAL,DEVICE PROXY SERVICE.
    (Reference DBIA #4677)
    
    A post-init routine MDPOST21 will be run during installation to
    create the Application Proxy.
 
 2) Once the verified final result is transmitted from the medical device:
       a) The associated note of the study can be administratively closed
          using the Application Proxy.
       b) (For Muse device Only) The associated note can be administratively
          closed using the interpreter.
          NOTE: IF ONLY your site sets up the interpreter on the MUSE
                with the internal entry number in the New Person file (#200).
                                                              
 3) If the medical device sends text impression, it can be included in the
    note or entered as a significant finding on the procedure.
                                                                
 4) When the note is completed with the administrative closure, the procedure
    will be completed.  If the text is entered as a significant finding, the
    note will remain in the "Undictated" status as the normal Clinical
    Procedure (CP) process.
 
 5) If the text is entered as a significant finding, the detailed consult
    will be viewable on the Consults tab and Procedures (local Only)
    component on the Reports tab in the Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS).
 
 6) Any current Procedural Terminology/Diagnosis codes transmitted from
    the device will be passed to Patient Care Encounter (PCE).
                                                           
 NEW OPTIONS:
 
    NAME: MD HIGH VOLUME PROCEDURE SETUP
    Menu Text: High Volume Procedure Setup
    This option will let the user populate a list of CP procedures and set
    it up for high volume procedure process.  This option will populate the
    XPAR Parameters MD GET HIGH VOLUME and MD NOT ADMN CLOSE MUSE NOTE. 
 
    NAME: MD PROC W/INCOMPLETE WORKLOAD
    Menu Text: Print list of Procedure with incomplete workload
    This option will print a list of procedures within Clinical Procedures
    that have incomplete workload.  This option is a tool for the users to
    find studies that do not have the workload completed.
                                                         
    NAME: MD PROCESS RESULTS
    Menu Text: MD Process Results
    This option will need to be scheduled for every hour.  This task will
    update Consult of the processed result.
                                                             
                                                
 NEW PARAMETER DEFINITIONS:
 
    NAME: MD GET HIGH VOLUME
    DESCRIPTION:
    This parameter will contain a free text string that contains two pieces
    of data delimited by a semicolon ';'.  The two pieces of data are: 1)
    1/0 (Yes/No) to indicate whether or not the text of the result should be
    added to the note, 2) 1/0 (Yes/No) to enter the text of the result as the
    significant finding of the Consult. (If you enter a 0, the note will be
    auto closed with the text inside.)
    Example string: 1;0
 
    NAME: MD NOT ADMN CLOSE MUSE NOTE
    DESCRIPTION:
    This parameter is used to indicate the note should not be 
    administratively closed with the proxy user CLINICAL, DEVICE PROXY 
    SERVICE but the interpreter of the procedure for the MUSE device.
    The default is "No".
                                                                     
    NAME: MD USE NOTE
    DESCRIPTION:   
    This parameter indicates that Clinical Procedures will use the note
    for the text of the result instead of the Significant Finding field in
    Consult.

 MISCELLANEOUS FIXES
 ===================
 1) Remedy Ticket: 305536
   
    Wilmington reported that their encounters were checked out before
    all the workload information have been entered in CP-Hemodialysis.
    Routine MDPCE2 was modified to check if procedure, diagnosis codes,
    and provider was entered before checking out the encounter when the
    Treatment Summary is signed.
                                                                
 2) Remedy Ticket 340824 and 342114
                                                                     
    Buffalo and Louisville reported that when the STATE field is blank,
    it generated an exception error in routine MDHL7BH.  Routine MDHL7BH
    was modified to fix this issue.
                                                                        
 3) Routines MDHL7U3,MDPCE2,MDRPCW, MDRPCW1, and MDRPCWU were modified to
    call Application Program Interface $$ICDDX^ICDCODE for the DIAGNOSIS
    field (#3) of the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80).  Associated NSR 20010604
    and 20030304 Code Set Versioning change.
                                                                   
 4) Omaha reported that the text "\.br\" was not screened out from the result
    generated from KinetDx Echocardiogram device.  Routine MDHL7K1 was
    modified to fix this.

  PRE-INSTALLATION STEP:
  =====================
  If both MD SCHEDULED STUDIES and MD STUDY CHECK-IN are scheduled
  at your site, stop both of the tasks before installation.
                                              
 
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  =========================
  Users may remain on the system but this patch should be installed at
  non-peak hours due to the high volume use of the routines included.
  Installation should take less than 3 minutes.
  
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan 
        menu.
     2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
        select the Installation menu.
     3. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1.0*21):
              a.  Backup a Transport Global
              b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
              c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
     4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the patch MD*1.0*21.
     5. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
        Install? NO//", take the default. 
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
        install? NO//", take the default.
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
        Options, and Protocols? NO//", take the default.
     8. When prompted 'DEVICE: HOME //', respond with <ENTER> or a device. 
 
 POST-INSTALLATION STEPS:
 =======================
 1) Re-start the following tasks MD SCHEDULED STUDIES and MD STUDY CHECK-IN.
 2) Schedule option MD PROCESS RESULTS to run for every hour.
 3) Review Accessing Modules under General CP Package Information in the
    Clinical Procedures Implementation Guide to assign new options as
    SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS.
 4) Review Chapter 7 on Application Proxy User in the Clinical
    Procedures Implementation Guide and add a signature block
    for the Application Proxy User, CLINICAL,DEVICE PROXY SERVICE.
 5) Review Appendix E - High Volume Procedure Checklist in the
    Clinical Procedures Implementation Guide to setup a
    high volume procedure.
 6) Once the Application Proxy User is created after the installation
    of the patch, the sites can delete the post-installation routine
    MDPOST21.  The sites can re-run the post-init routine, if it is
    needed.
