Description:
============

 Wilkes-Barre reported that the patient's allergies, Clinical Warnings,
 Advanced Directives, and Infectious Diseases are not displaying for a
 selected patient in the Hemodialysis application. The allergies, Clinical
 Warnings, and Advanced Directives of the initial patient are displayed
 for the subsequent patient selected.  The application screen did not
 refresh after patient selection.  Hemodialysis build 320 is issued to
 resolve this problem.  Hepatitis B Surface Antigen, Hepatitis B Surface
 Antibody, and Hepatitis C Surface Antibody data will not be available under
 the Infectious Disease section of the Cover sheet.  They will be available
 under the Lab Result of the Rx and Lab tab.
 
 A post-init routine MDPOST19 will update the application build from 319 to
 320 on the server side.  This routine will be deleted after installation of
 the KIDS build.

        menu.
     2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
        select the Installation menu.

  ----------------                                                     
  Client GUI application (Hemodialysis.exe) and help file (Hemodialysis.hlp)
  should replace the existing application file of the current system.
  
  The default location of the CP applications is in the following pathway:
  
    C:\Program Files\VistA\Hemodialysis\
                                                                
  By replacing the existing application (.exe) file on your system, 
  the shortcuts on your desktop along with their command line switches
  will remain set correctly.
