Associated patches: (v)MD*1*21     <<= must be installed BEFORE `MD*1*34'

Subject: MODIFY AUTO-COMPLETE OF PROCEDURE TIME  

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issue:
      
 When utilizing the auto-complete functionality of Clinical Procedures
 to bring procedures with machine results to a complete status, the system
 will only look back 5 days from the time the procedure was scheduled.  Any
 longer than that and the users must bring the procedures to a complete
 status manually.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1.  HD0000000442635 High Volume Issues
  
   Problem:
   -------
   The MD PROCESS RESULTS scheduled task will only process results for
   orders that are requested/scheduled up to 5 days in the past.  The sites
   wanted to expand the number of days so the results will be picked up for
   orders requested more than 5 days ago.
      
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Routine MDHL7XXX will be modified to look back 365 days instead of 5
   days.       
      
      
 Installation Instructions:

 * scheduled to run every 90 seconds.  Reschedule the task to run      *
 * hourly the first time it runs after the install. It may take 10-20  *
 * minutes to run the first time. Then when it is complete, unschedule *
 * the task again and reschedule back to your normal interval.         *
