Description:
============

 This is a support patch for the Hemodialysis Application.  It contains 
 the necessary software routines, data dictionaries, and remote procedure
 calls for Clinical Procedures (CP) Version 1.0 so the Hemodialysis
 application can interface and use CP to integrate with the Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS).

 508 Compliance
 ==============
 The Clinical Procedures Hemodialysis Software is exempt
 from coverage under the Section 508 standards.  The definition of
 "electronic and information technology" in the Section 508 standards
 specifically excludes "medical equipment where information technology
 is integral to its operation." 36 C.F.R. Section 1194.4.  VHA's use of
 the Clinical Procedures Hemodialysis Software also does not violate
 Section 508 because it will not affect access to the data or information
 provided by that software. 29 U.S.C. Section 794d(a).  The data or
 information collected by the software is immediately made available
 through the CPRS system, which is accessible to people with disabilities.

 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGE
 ======================
 1) A new field will be added called PROCESSING APPLICATION field (#.06)
    in the CP DEFINITION file (#702.01).

               LAST EDITED:      JUL 19, 2005
               DESCRIPTION:      This field is used to indicate if this is a
                                 Hemodialysis procedure or not.  The field is a
                                 set of codes, 1=DEFAULT so it will be processed
                                 by Clinical Procedures or 2=HEMODIALYSIS and
                                 the procedure will be processed by the
                                 Hemodialysis application.  
                                                                               
                       
 2) The VISIT field has been added in the CP Transaction file (#702) to support
    the billing section of the Hemodialysis software.

               HELP-PROMPT:      Enter a Visit number. 
               DESCRIPTION:      This is the Visit number returned from PCE.  It
                                 is the pointer to the Visit file (#9000010).

                                 This cross reference is used to make sure that
                                 a Visit file entry is not deleted as long as
                                 there is an entry.

                                 This cross reference tells Visit Tracking how
                                 many file entries are using (point to) a Visit 
                                 file entry.  
  
  
 3) The STUDY REFERENCE NUMBER field (#.05) in the CP RESULT REPORT file
    (#703.1) was changed from FREE TEXT to POINTER to the CP TRANSACTION file
    (#702).  A new cross reference "ASTUDYID" was added.

  Mumps Installation:                                                 
  ------------------                                                  
  Users may remain on the system but this patch should be installed at
  non-peak hours due to the high volume use of the routines included.
  Installation should take less than 3 minutes.
  
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan 
        menu.
     2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
        select the Installation menu.
     3. Select Load a Distribution and enter the directory of the
        host file and the host file name,SYS$USER:[XXX]MD1_0P6.KID,
        at the "Enter a Host File:" prompt.
     4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1.0*6):
              a.  Backup a Transport Global
              b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
              c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the patch MD*1.0*6.
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
        Install? NO//", take the default.
     7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
        install? NO//", take the default.
     8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
        Options, and Protocols? NO//", take the default.
     9. When prompted 'DEVICE: HOME //', respond with <ENTER> or a device.
                                                                     
                                                          
 
  GUI Installation:                                                     
  ----------------                                                     
  Client GUI applications (CP Manager.exe and CP Gateway) should replace the
  existing application files of the current system.  You MUST shutdown
  the CP Gateway by selecting the Shutdown Gateway from the "File" pull down
  menu during non-peak hours.  Replace the CPGateway.exe.
 
  The default location of the CP applications is in the following pathway:
 
    C:\Program Files\VistA\Clinical Procedures\
                                                                
  By replacing the existing application (.exe) files on your system, 
  the shortcuts on your desktop along with their command line switches
  will remain set correctly. If you accidentally delete your CP shortcuts, 
  you must reset the command line switches to be as they were when CP was
  first installed. Refer to the CP Implementation Guide, Appendix A - CP
  Application Startup Options and Command Line Switches for information 
  on resetting the command line switches on your shortcuts.
 
  The help files CPMANAGER.hlp and CPMANAGER.cnt should replace the existing
  CP Manager help files.
                                                                
    The default location of the help files is in the following pathway:
                                                           
      C:\Program Files\VistA\Clinical Procedures\Help
  
  If the CP application was placed elsewhere, the pathway to the 
  application and help files will be within that location.
 
                                                                             
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION:
 =============================                    
  RE-START the CP Gateway and install CPHemodialysis.exe after the
  KIDS installation.
