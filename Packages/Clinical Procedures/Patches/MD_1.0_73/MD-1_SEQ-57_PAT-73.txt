Subject: ELIMINATE ALERTS FOR RETRACTED NOTES AND CORRECT HIGH VOLUME SETUP ISSUES

Category:

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues in the Clinical Procedures 
 package:

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5256127 - Multiple Procedure Alerts on Retracted Note
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 Placing a Text Integration Utility (TIU) note in 'Retracted' status in
 Clinical Procedures causes a repeating "procedure ready for
 interpretation" alert to be sent each time the MD PROCESS RESULTS
 background job runs. This could generate hundreds/thousands of alerts 
 depending on how often this background job runs.
      
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 A modification will be made in routine MDHL7XXX to not send the alert if
 the note is in a 'Retracted' Status.
      
           
 2. INC6092268 - High Volume bugs discovered
  
 Problem 2A:
 ----------- 
 When using the menu option High Volume Procedure Setup [MD HIGH VOLUME
 PROCEDURE SETUP], the software would allow a Clinical procedure to be
 setup for High Volume without the associated note title's technical fields
 COMMIT ACTION and POST-SIGNATURE CODE fields being set to "Q(UIT)" as
 required by the application setup.
      
 Resolution 2A:
 --------------     
 Routine MDARSET is modified to skip the prompt asking the user if they
 want to set the technical fields when entering a new procedure setup. The 
 routine will refuse to set up the new procedure if the note title is
 in an ACTIVE status.  The user MUST set the note title to INACTIVE to add 
 the new procedure to the High Volume setup.
 If deleting a procedure setup from High Volume, they are still prompted if
 they want to update the technical fields (delete the 'Q's), as it is
 possible for multiple procedures to share a note title.
      
 Problem 2B: 
 -----------
 When using the menu option High Volume Procedure Setup [MD HIGH VOLUME
 PROCEDURE SETUP] for a Muse Procedure and the 'Use Interpreter to close
 note?' prompt is answered 'YES', the user is not prompted to set the
 associated note title's technical fields COMMIT ACTION and POST-SIGNATURE
 CODE to 'Q(uit)'.
      
 Resolution 2B:
 --------------     
 Routine MDARSET is modified, when adding a new Muse procedure to High 
 Volume setup, the routine automatically sets the associated note title's
 technical fields to a 'Q' on a Muse Procedure when the 'Use Interpreter to
 close note?' is set to 'YES'. It no longer asks to set the technical
 fields and it reminds the user to REACTIVATE the NOTE TITLE.

     ---------------------------
     NOTE:  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1.0*73:
       
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ===========================
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
        
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
      
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
      
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
      
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
             
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 This patch does not modify existing High Volume Procedures technical 
 fields of those procedures that are currently defined at the site.
 It is strongly recommended that each procedure setup be examined and
 corrected if they do not show 'Q' as shown below:
  
 (example:)
 Procedure:    CP PROCEDURE   
  
      This procedure has note title CP TEST NOTE TITLE associated with it.
      The current setup is as follows:
  
           STATUS:               ACTIVE
           COMMIT ACTION:        Q
           POST-SIGNATURE CODE:  Q
  
      When a procedure is setup for High Volume, the COMMIT ACTION and
      POST-SIGNATURE CODE fields must contain a 'Q'. If you need to update
      these fields, the title (CP TEST NOTE TITLE) must be inactivated 
      first.
  
 At the "Procedure:" prompt, when you enter a '?', all existing High Volume
 Procedures are listed. Edit each one to verify the technical fields are 
 'Q' and not <NULL>.
  
 IMPORTANT NOTE: Before you can make changes in the setup, the associated
 note title needs to be INACTIVE first. This is listed when you edit the
 procedures as:
  
      This procedure has note title ############# associated with it.
  
 After editing, DON'T FORGET TO REACTIVATE YOUR NOTE TITLES.
