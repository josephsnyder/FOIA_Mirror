Subject: CP HEMO DEFAULT DATE 12-30-1899 SUMMARY TAB

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue in the Clinical Procedures
 package: 
   
 1. INC6914927 - Diagnosis Date and Initial Therapy Date default to
                 12/30/1899
  
 New Service Requests (NSRs):

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC6914927 - On the current Treatment Status Report Screen, Diagnosis
 Date and Initial Therapy Date is blank.  It looks like the TIU Document
 Details section is still populated with 12-30-1899.
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 The default value for Diagnosis Date and Initial Therapy Date is set to 
 the arbitrarily value of 12-30-1899. The default value is assigned by 
 formatting a blank value. Initial analysis showed that the code was 
 assigning that specific date to a null entry, but this value was being 
 changed to 12-30-1899.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 The CP Hemodialysis GUI was modified to not format a blank value to avoid 
 creating that wrong date. For dates previously saved as 12-30-1899, the 
 GUI will replace the 12-30-1899 date to <blank>.
