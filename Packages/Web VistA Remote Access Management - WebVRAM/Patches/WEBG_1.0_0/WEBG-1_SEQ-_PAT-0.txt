Subject: WEBVRAM INITIAL RELEASE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 The new Web Vista Remote Access Management (WebVRAM) web application allows
 users to provision themselves in other remote VistA systems directly, with
 the same user profile that they have in their local VistA system, without
 having to submit a help desk request for access. This gives these users the
 ability to logon and use these remote VistA systems, without re-entering
 their Access/Verify codes, with the same level of access they have in their
 local VistA system. This feature, and the time it saves the user, directly
 supports Veteran Telehealth and benefit initiatives.
  
 WebVRAM is a web-based app, and replaces the similar VRAM client/server
 application. This gives users the same functionality as VRAM, but without
 having to install the VRAM client software on their workstations.
  
 As part of the preparation for this installation, this patch is being sent
 out to provide a WebVRAM menu option entry for the RPCs it uses, and to
 update the REMOTE APPLICATION (#8994.5) file, as WebVRAM uses the Broker
 Security Enhancement (BSE) to do its work.  Please read the DATA DICTIONARY
 description of this file for more information.
  
 This patch contains a single routine, which is a post install routine that 
 is automatically executed after patch installation.  This routine adds one 
 entry (WEBVRAM) to the REMOTE APPLICATION (#8994.5) file, which is the BSE
 entry for the WebVRAM callback to the VistA system. This patch contains one
 new entry (WEBG WEBVRAM GUI) in the OPTION (#19) file, for the RPCs used by
 WebVRAM.  This patch also adds one new entry (WEBG AV PUSH) to the SECURITY
 KEY (#19.1) file, that is used to manage users of WebVRAM.
  
 In addition to the test sites listed below, the Fee Basis Claims System
 (FBCS) Technical Team will be testing FBCS functionality during IOC testing
 of this patch.
