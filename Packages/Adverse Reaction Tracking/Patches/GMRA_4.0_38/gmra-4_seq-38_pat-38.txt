 Patch 38 description
 --------------------
 Currently, when a new observed allergy is entered or an existing allergy 
 is marked as entered in error a progress note is created. When these 
 actions are taken from within CPRS GUI the note is not added to the items 
 requiring signature.  As a result, when the user is finished working with 
 that patient the progress note is not displayed for signature as is 
 expected.
  
 The progress note is created outside of the context of CPRS and CPRS is 
 therefore unaware of the fact that the progress note needs to be signed.  
 Beginning with CPRS v27 and the installation of this patch, CPRS will be 
 made aware of the creation of the progress note and it will be added to
 the list of items to be signed when the patient record is exited or if the
 sign items action is taken.
  
 Patch 38 also includes a post-install that will identify any allergy 
 entries in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) that have an incorrect 
 pointer value in the GMR ALLERGY field and convert it to a free text 
 entry. The installer will receive an email listing any entries that were
 updated.  The site will need to use the 'allergy clean up utility' to fix
 those entries.
