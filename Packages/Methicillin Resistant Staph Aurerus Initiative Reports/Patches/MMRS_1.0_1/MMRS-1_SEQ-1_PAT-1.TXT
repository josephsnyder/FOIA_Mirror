Subject: PANEL TESTS IN COMPLIANCE LIST AND OTHER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch fixes the following issues:
      
 1. If a site uses a Lab Panel to order tests, and the 
 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal screen is
 contained in the panel, then the MRSA Program Tools software does not 
 capture that the MRSA nasal screen was obtained on the Print Nares Screen 
 Compliance List [MMRS NARES SWAB LIST] option. 
      
 2. On the Print MRSA IPEC Report [MMRS MRSA IPEC REPORT] option there is
 no way to identify which patients were indicated for a swab. This patch
 modifies the Admission and Discharge/Transmission Reports and adds an
 asterisk (*) before the patient's name if they were indicated for a MRSA
 nasal screen, based on business rules for nares screening for the selected
 facility.
         
 3. Currently, the MAS Movement Type 'PRE-BED CARE (OPT-PBC)' admission is 
 excluded from the Print MRSA IPEC Report [MMRS MRSA IPEC REPORT] and Print
 Nares Screen Compliance List [MMRS NARES SWAB LIST] options. This patch
 modifies the reports to include that admission. 
                         
 4. The MRSA Program Tools Technical Manual and User Manual had
 formatting/layout problems and have been updated.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000385857 - Reports Issue
                  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 If a site orders a panel test that contains the MRSA nasal screen atomic 
 test, the Print Nares Screen Compliance List [MMRS NARES SWAB LIST] option
 will show that the nasal screen has not been ordered. This report fails to
 look within the panel to see if one of the atomic tests is the MRSA nasal
 screen.
            
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 The Print Nares Screen Compliance List [MMRS NARES SWAB LIST] option was
 modified to search within the panel test to see if any of the atomic tests
 is the MRSA nasal screen test.
           
 2. HD0000000391558 - Report issue  
          
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 If a site uses the MAS Movement Type of 'PRE-BED CARE (OPT-PBC)' to admit 
 a patient, the Print MRSA IPEC Report [MMRS MRSA IPEC REPORT] and Print
 Nares Screen Compliance List [MMRS NARES SWAB LIST] options will not pick
 up that admission.
           
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 The Print MRSA IPEC Report [MMRS MRSA IPEC REPORT] and Print Nares Screen
 Compliance List [MMRS NARES SWAB LIST] options were modified to include
 the 'PRE-BED CARE (OPT-PBC)' MAS Movement Type.
           
           
   Documentation Retrieval:
   ========================
   Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:

      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
            
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
