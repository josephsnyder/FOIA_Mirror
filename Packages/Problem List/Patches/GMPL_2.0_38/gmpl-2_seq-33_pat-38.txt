Subject: Fix for Problem List Priority Value

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem with the problem list priority field always
 being set to a value of "Unknown". This can happen when the user is adding
 a new problem list entry to the patient chart, or when editing an existing
 problem list entry. If the user picks a priority of "Acute" or "Chronic" when
 adding or editing a problem list entry, the entry is saved to the PROBLEM file
 with a priority of "Unknown". This will only happen to Problem tab entries
 that were added or edited after GMPL*2.0*37 was installed on the system.
 
 A site can use FileMan to find a list of entries that were added or modified
 after GMPL*2.0*37 was installed on the system.
 
 1. Find the Installation date for GMPL*2.0*37 by doing a FileMan Inquiry
    for GMPL*2.0*37 in the Install File. The Install Completed date is the
    date that is needed to find the list of entries that were added or
    modified after GMPL*2.0*37 was installed.
 2. Do a FileMan Print on the PROBLEM file, file number 9000011.
 3. At the SORT BY: prompt, enter DATE LAST MODIFIED.
 4. At the START WITH DATE LAST MODIFIED prompt, enter the date from step 1.
 5. At the GO TO DATE LAST MODIFIED prompt, accept the default of Last.
 6. At the WITHIN DATE LAST MODIFIED SORT BY prompt, you do not need to
    enter anything in this prompt. However, if you want to sort by another
    field you would enter it here.
 7. For the Print Fields, we recommend the DIAGNOSIS, PATIENT NAME, ENTERED BY,
    DATE ENTERED, and the DATE LAST MODIFIED fields.
