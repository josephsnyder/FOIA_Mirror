Subject: FY09 Q4 ENHANCEMENTS - REMOVAL OF PPP PACKAGE

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The FY09 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the retirement of the Pharmacy 
 Prescription Practices (PPP) V. 1.0 package. This is a follow-up patch for 
 the nationally released patch PPP*1*43 to resolve Patient Safety Issue 
 PSI-07-114. Per PSI-07-114, the PPP package does not provide the most
 recent and up-to-date data on prescriptions from other sites. Patch
 PPP*1*43 made the PPP options unavailable by marking them as 'Out of
 Order'. This patch, PPP*1*44, will remove every component (see list below)
 of the PPP package from sites.
   
 1. The following PPP options will be removed. 
     Edit Parameter File [PPP (EDIT) PARAMETER]
     Background Purge Logfile [PPP BACKGROUND PURGE LOGFILE]
     Purge Other Facility Xref [PPP BACKGROUND PURGE XREF]
     Prescription Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP BATCH]
     Build/Rebuild Other Facility Xref [PPP BUILD FFX]
     Display Visits to other Facilities [PPP DISPLAY FOREIGN VISITS]
     Edit Unresolved Domain Entries [PPP EDIT DOMAIN]
     Edit other Facility Cross-Reference [PPP EDIT FFX]
     Initialize Logfile Purge [PPP INIT PURGE LOGFILE JOB]
     Initialize Xref Purge [PPP INIT PURGE XREF JOB]
     Initialize Statistic File [PPP INIT STAT]
     Prescription Practices Utilities [PPP MAIN]
     Add/Edit Merged Sites [PPP MERGED SITE EDIT]
     Print Clinic Medication Profiles [PPP PRINT CLINIC PROFILES]
     Print Other Facility Cross-Reference ...[PPP PRINT FFX]
     Print Log File [PPP PRINT LOG]
     Print Statistic File [PPP PRINT STATISTICS]
     Purge Log File [PPP PURGE LOGFILE]
     Purge Logfile Menu [PPP PURGE LOGFILE MENU]
     Purge Xref Menu [PPP PURGE XREF MENU]
     Purge Other Facility Xref [PPP XREF PURGE]
  
 2. The PPP input template, PPP EDIT FILE, will be removed.
  
 3. The PPP sort template, PPP LOGS, will be removed.
  
 4. The following PPP list templates will be removed.
     PPP FFX DISPLAY    PPP LOG DISPL   PPP PROFILE           PPP VISITS
     PPP FFX REPORTS    PPP PRINT       PPP UNRESOLVED DOM    PPP XREF EDIT
  
 5. The following PPP print templates will be removed.
     PPP CODE LIST      PPP LOGP        
     PPP LOG            PPPSTAP
  
 6. The following PPP protocols will be removed.
     PPP (MENU) DOM      PPP ADD FF ENTRY    PPP DEL FF ENTRY  PPP EDIT FF ENTRY
     PPP (MENU) FF XREF  PPP CHANGE ALL DOM  PPP DISPL BOTH 
     PPP (MENU) VISITS   PPP CHANGE DOM      PPP DISPL OTHER 
  
 7. The PPP security key, PPP UTIL, will be removed.
  
 8. All PPP standard routines will be removed. If after the patch is installed
    there are still routines starting with PPP then the site will be 
    responsible for reviewing and deleting those routines.
  
 9. The following PPP files and data will be removed.
     PPP PARAMETER (#1020.1)              PPP EXCLUSION (#1020.5)
     PPP CONVERSION SITE (#1020.128)      PPP CODE (#1020.6)
     PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF (#1020.2)  PPP NEW SSN (#1020.7)
     PPP STATISTIC (#1020.3)              PPP DOMAIN XREF (#1020.8)
     PPP LOG (#1020.4)
  
 10. A background job will be tasked when the patch is installed to remove
     the PPP files and data. Upon completion of the job, a MailMan message 
     with the subject "PPP Package Data & Data Dictionary Removal" is
     generated showing a list of files that were deleted. If there are
     routines that begin with PPP that were not removed, then they will be
     listed in the message. These routines will need to be reviewed by IRM 
     to determine if they should be removed.
