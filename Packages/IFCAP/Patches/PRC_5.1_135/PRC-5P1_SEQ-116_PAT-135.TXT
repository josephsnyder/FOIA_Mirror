 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 HD0000000055279 Ceiling transactions not showing up on Running Balance 
                    (RB) Report.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Processed a ceiling transaction which did not post on the Control Point's 
 Running Balance Report, however it does show up when the Ceiling Report 
 is printed. This happens when using option [Change Existing Transaction 
 Number]. 
  
 In addition, when editing a New Purchase Order, Detailed Purchase Card 
 Order or Delivery Order a new order date/FCP causes the following 
 problems:
  -- Duplicate cross-reference "RB" nodes will occur  
  -- Inventory item within order will cause skipping of creation of
     correct requisition number, modifying existing req# and canceling
     old req# entry
  -- Changing order date that will fall into new fiscal quarter does
     not modify the req# or 'RB' entry to correct FY and FQ.     
  -- 4 digit Fund Control Point (ex. 0498) will appear as 498 in 
     requisition number and 'RB' cross reference entry in File 410
     [CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY].
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines PRCSUT3 and PRCHNPOA to insure that the editing of the
 Order Date and/or the Fund Control Point will create the correct
 requisition number and 'RB' cross reference entry in the File 410 [CONTROL
 POINT ACTIVITY].
  
  
 Routines: PRCSUT2, PRCHNPOA, PRCH135P (deleted after install)
  
    >>> POST INSTALL RUN TO FIX CROSS REFERENCE 'RB' IN FILE #410 <<<
        [CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY].
  
 *** There will be a post install run that will delete duplicate 'RB'
 *** cross reference entries associated with a record internal number
 *** with a different Fund Control Point.  Also, it will delete any 'RB'
 *** cross references that are linked to a null master record.
