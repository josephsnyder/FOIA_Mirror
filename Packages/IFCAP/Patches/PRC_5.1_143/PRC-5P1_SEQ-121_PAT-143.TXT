Subject: FCP TRANSFERS REVIEW DISPLAY;EDIT P.O. CC;SHIP TO ADDRESS ON P.O.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1. When some sites transfer funds from one Control Point to another they
    receive the message 'No Records To Print' even though they have just
    entered a valid transaction that should show up.
  
 2. When a user tries to complete an incomplete Detailed Purchase Card Order,
    the Cost Center that was originally entered may not be displayed during
    the edit process.
  
 3. There is an inconsistency between the 'SHIP TO ADDRESS' information
    entered using the Prosthetics GUI order entry screen and what is displayed
    when reprinting the same order from within IFCAP.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000346865 Cannot transfer from one Control Point to another 
                    Control Point
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a site transfers funds from one Control Point to another they receive
 the message *** NO RECORDS TO PRINT *** when trying to review the entry.
  
 This problem arises when the user wants to review a temporary work
 transaction in the FUND DISTRIBUTION (TEMP TRANS) file [#421.6] by using
 the option 'Transfer From/To Control Point' [PRCB SINGLE TRANSFER].  These
 temporary transactions use a computer-assigned job number as part of the
 transaction identifier.  Some VHA systems are now using longer job numbers
 that cause the identifier not to match the expected format and as a result
 the system is unable to locate the proper record.  
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The TRANSACTION NUMBER field [#.01] in the FUND DISTRIBUTION (TEMP TRANS)
 file [#421.6] has a maximum allowable length of 17 characters.  This field
 is composed of the station number, a hyphen, the 3 character database volume
 name, another hyphen and the computer-assigned job number.  This format
 worked as long as the job number was not more than 9 digits long.  Since
 some job numbers are now longer than that, the code was modified to use no
 more than 9 digits when creating the transaction id.

 2. HD0000000378077 Existing Cost Center not shown during edit
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user edits an incomplete Detailed Purchase Card Order, the Cost 
 Center value which was entered during the initial order creation may not 
 be displayed.  The problem does not always happen and is only encountered 
 if the user follows a particular sequence of steps.
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The IFCAP routine PRCHNPO3 is modified to always display the original
 Cost Center as the default value if the user has not changed the Fund
 Control Point.
  
  
 Routines:  PRCHNPO3
  
  
 3. HD0000000380341 SHIP TO ADDRESS inconsistent between GUI and IFCAP
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The SHIP TO address information that is entered using the Prosthetics GUI
 application is not the address information being used by the IFCAP package.
 IFCAP is designed to use a default SHIP TO address for all orders and does
 not look at Prosthetics to get any over-ride address.  This is a problem
 for the warehouse when they use the options 'REPRINT PURCHASE CARD ORDER'
 and 'DISPLAY PURCHASE ORDER/REQUISITION' to prepare items for delivery.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Without a redesign of the current system it is not possible to get the two
 applications to print the same SHIP TO address.  Therefore a next best
 alternative has been chosen.  The reprint options for a purchase order and
 a purchase card order have been modified to pull the fields DELIVER TO [#19]
 and DELIVER TO ATTENTION [#21.1] from the PROSTHETICS 1358 file [#664]
 and add them to the IFCAP reprinted order.  The information entered in these
 fields in the Prosthetics GUI can aid the warehouse in ascertaining the
 correct delivery location.
  
 For Prosthetics orders entered via the Prosthetics package but reprinted 
 using IFCAP, the reports will now contain a new section that looks like:
   ______________________________________________________________________
   Prosthetics Delivery information:
          Delivery To: OTHER LOCATION AT THIS SITE
              Attention: DELIVER DIRECTLY TO OPERATING ROOM (112)
   ______________________________________________________________________
  
 The 'Delivery To' value is based on clicking the 'Other Location - At This
 Site' button on the Delivery Location tab in the Prosthetics GUI entry.
 The 'Attention' value is whatever was entered in the 'Attn:' text box in the
 Prosthetics GUI entry.
