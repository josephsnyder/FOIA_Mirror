Description:
============

 The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) uses Miscellaneous Obligations
 (also referred to as 1358s) to record estimates for payments for goods
 and services when the quantities and delivery dates are unknown. It also 
 simplifies the procurement process when no underlying contract or 
 purchase order exists (i.e. umbrella agreement for Fee-based medical
 services provided by multiple providers). Miscellaneous Obligations are
 tracked using the Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity,
 Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) application within the Veterans Health
 Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) system.
  
 IFCAP is able to uniquely identify whether a transaction is a 1358 or a
 Certified Purchase Order, but currently FMS is not able to distinguish
 between the transaction sent to obligate a 1358 and the one sent to
 obligate a Certified Purchase Order.
  
 This patch addresses the inability to uniquely identify a 1358 transaction
 in FMS. IFCAP will pass a 1358 Identifier as part of the current Service
 Order (SO) transaction that is sent to FMS when a 1358 is obligated in
 IFCAP. This new functionality will enable FMS to provide VA leadership
 with statistical data on 1358 procurement activities.
  
 This patch also includes an update to the current Clinical Logistics
 Report Server extract process also known as the National Logistics
 Database (NLD) interface with IFCAP. The extracts will now include
 additional existing data fields in Control Point Activity file (#410),
 the 1358 Daily Record file (#424), the 1358 Authorization Detail file
 (#424.1) and the Procurement & Accounting Transactions file (#442). To
 help sites monitor compliance with policies for the use of 1358s, this
 patch also adds a Compliance Reports (1358) menu to the IFCAP Application
 Coordinator's menu. From this new menu a user can execute a Missing Fields
 Report (1358) to identify 1358 obligation and adjustment requests for a
 user specified date range where the Vendor, Vendor contract #, or
 Purpose (justification) is not populated. Also on this menu is a
 Separation of Duties Violations Report (1358) to identify 1358 Obligation
 and Adjustment transactions for a user specified date range where an
 individual has signed in more than one of the following roles: Control
 Point Clerk (Requestor), Control Point Official (Approver), or Fiscal
 (Obligated by). This would violate Separation of Duties policy requiring
 that three different Users are involved in the processing of every 1358.
 This patch also introduces the option 1358 Monitoring Reports - Scheduled
 [PRC 1358 MONITORING] which should be scheduled to run daily. This option
 invokes each of the above reports for requests approved the previous day
 (Tue - Sat execution) or the prior 2 days (Mon execution). No report is  
 generated on Sunday. The output of each report is loaded into a MailMan
 message sent to the new PRC 1358 MONITORS mail group.
  
 To help sites validate the data exported in the CLRS (NLD) host files,
 this patch also adds a CLRS Extract Validation Templates menu to the
 Clinical Logistics Office Menu. This new menu contains options for viewing
 data in VistA. The templates may be used to view IFCAP data within the
 IFCAP files. 
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 ------------------------------------------------------------- 
 20080801  Enhancing Internal Controls and Reporting Capabilities for 1358 
           Misc Obligations
  
 A recent GAO review questioned VHA's internal control standards governing
 the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations as well as 
 oversight abilities. This request seeks to implement adequate controls 
 with respect to segregation of duties and oversight by contracting 
 officials, improve documentation requirements, and enhance 1358 reporting 
 capabilities within IFCAP that will be used at the station, VISN, and 
 enterprise levels.

    1.  Add members to the new PRC 1358 MONITORS mail group. Members
        should be users selected to monitor compliance of 1358 usage to
        policy and who are expected to review the daily mail messages 
        containing the 1358 Transactions Missing Critical Fields and the
        1358 Separation of Duties Violations reports. There should be
        at least one active user.
  
    2.  Verify that your VistA installation has a functional p-message
        device that can be referenced as P-MESSAGE-HFS. This is the
        device to which the scheduled 1358 compliance reports are written.
  
    3.  Schedule option 1358 Monitoring Reports - Scheduled [PRC 1358 
        MONITORING] to run daily after midnight so that the mail messages 
        containing the reports are available to staff when they begin their
        tour of duty in the morning. i.e.
     Select Taskman Management Option: SCHEDULE/UNSCHedule Options

    4.  As appropriate, assign the 1358 Compliance Reports [PRC 1358
        COMPLIANCE REPORTS] menu as a secondary menu option to users
        selected to monitor compliance of 1358 usage. The compliance
        reports can be run interactively from this menu with the user
        selecting the date range and the output device. This menu is
        attached to the IFCAP Application Coordinator Menu [PRCHUSER 
        COORDINATOR] during the installation of this patch.
  
    5.  Ensure that your VistA system has sufficient available storage
        space for up to a year's worth of data in the CLRS (NLD) extract.
        For a medium sized station with 36,065 entries in the Procurement
        & Accounting Transactions file (#442) created for a 12 month
        period, the extract has built a ^TMP($J) global of 108 Mb and a
        combined host files size of 102 Mb. Combined host file sizes at
        some other production sites were as follows:
           # of File #442 Entries        Combined Host File Size
           For Fiscal Year to Date
               12,184                        35.6 Mb
               19,741                        41.0 Mb
               33,900                        98.2 Mb
        One would expect that the sizes of ^TMP($J) globals built during
        the extraction process would be slightly larger. The extract when
        run at the beginning of a Fiscal Year, extracts transactions for
        the entire prior Fiscal Year (Oct 1 - Sep 30).
  
    6.  After the patch is installed, sites are instructed to manually
        generate the 1358 Separation of Duties Violations Report via
        option Separation of Duties Violations (1358) [PRC 1358
        SEPARATION VIOL] for the period of August 19, 2008 to Current
        Date (T) and direct the output to a host file or hard copy
        device for review.
   
    7.  A new Regional Acquisition Center field has been added to the
        CLRS System Parameters during the installation of this patch.
        Guidance for population of this field will be provided by the
        P&LO at a later date.
  
    8.  Please note that parameters PRCPLO USER NAME and PRCPLO PASSWORD
        are populated in Production accounts by the post-init routine
        PRCH130. They are not populated during the installation in
        accounts not identified as a Production account.

 Description of Changes:
  This routine references the sort and print templates for the 1358 
  Transactions Missing Critical Fields and the 1358 Separation of Duties 
  Violations reports and generates the reports via calls to the VA FileMan 
  print utility EN1^DIP.  No reports are generated on Sunday.  On Monday 
  the reports are for transactions approved on the prior Saturday or 
  Sunday.  For Tuesday through Saturday, the reports are for transactions 
  approved the day before.
   
  Line tag IN1 is invoked by scheduled option [PRC 1358 MONITORING]. Both 
  1358 compliance reports are generated and sent individually to the PRC 
  MONITORS mail group via p-message.
   
  Line tag IN3 is invoked by interactive option [PRC 1358 SEPARATION VIOL] 
  to generate the 1358 Separation of Duties Violations report for a user 
  specified date range and directed to an output device of the user's 
  choice.
   
  Line tag IN4 is invoked by interactive option [PRC 1358 MISSING FIELDS] 
  to generate the 1358 Transactions Missing Critical Fields report for a 
  user specified date range and directed to an output device of the user's 
  choice.
