Subject: NIF FILER ERR MSGS;GUI LOGISTICS TOOL ERR;FPDS DATA TRANSMISSION ERR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1. NIF (National Item File) Filer Error Messages - change to send to mail
    group rather than hard-coded person on Outlook. Will change mail group 
    from Lyford Greene to VHA NIF Maintenance Office.
  
  
 2. Receiving error when using Logistics GUI (Graphical User Interface)
    Tool. Modify the report to loop items ordered from disk rather than 
    pull the item information into memory.
  
 3. <UNDEFINED>AAC+151^PRCHACC - Error received due to order amendment 
    history being null. Will modify routine to create an HL7 message that 
    will collect and send nulls in an HL7 message.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000256450 NIF Filer Error Messages - change to send to mail group
                    rather than hard-coded person on Outlook
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Lyford Greene's name is hardcoded in the NIF filer routine as an 
 addressee for error messages, so all NIF filing error messages are
 sent to him. Remove Mr. Greene's name from the code and add 
 the following VA mail group: VHA NIF Maintenance Office.
  
 Replacing Mr. Greene's name with a mail group allows P&CLO (Prosthetic 
 Clinical Logistics Office) staff to change the recipients of the filing
 error messages by simply updating the mail group, rather than submitting
 future Remedy tickets.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine to change mail group recipient of NIF filing error messages
 from Lyford Greene to VHA NIF Maintenance Office.
  
 Routines: PRCHITEM
  
  
  
 2. HD0000000268347  Receiving error when using Logistics GUI Tool
  
 Problem:
 --------
 User receives error when using Logistics GUI Tool due to very large 
 Purchase Order records when brought into memory for reporting.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify report compilation routine to loop through items ordered directly
 from disk reads rather than attempt to pull the entire order item 
 information into memory.
  
 Routines: PRCHL4
  
  
  
 3. HD0000000252761  <UNDEFINED>AAC+151^PRCHACC 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 User modified the FPDS codes on an order that also had Partial Receipts 
 and Adjustment Voucher to Purchase Order. The user received an error due
 to the reason the modification pointer in order amendment history was
 null.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the routine that creates the HL7 message to gather FPDS data and
 send it to Austin.  If the FPDS reason for modification is null then send 
 null in HL7 message.
