    read $3000.
  
 2. When users receive a partial fractional quantity using the option
    Receipt of Purchase Order, they are then not allowed to post the same
    fractional quantity received in inventory.

    reported in the report instead of only the Purchasing Agents.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000295744 Simplified or Detailed PO question
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site requested information regarding simplified and detailed purchase
 card orders. Site submitted simplified order for $3000 and IFCAP stated
 that order cannot be over $2500.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification will be made to the Input Template [PRCHSIMP] that controls
 the input of a Simplified Order to concur with the $3000 limit mentioned
 in administrative bulletin (07GC1.01 November 15, 2006).
  
 Routines: none
  
 2. HD0000000290874 Partials with fractions unable to receive in Inventory
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When users receive a partial fractional quantity using option [Receipt
 of Purchase Order] they are not allowed to post the same fractional
 quantity received in inventory using option [Purchase Order Receiving To
 Inventory Point].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PRCPREC1 to check for fractional quantity entry and warn
 users that ordered inventory items that will have to be received into 
 inventory cannot be a partial fractional quantity.
  
 Message example:
  
 "This appears to be an inventory item that will have PURCHASE ORDER 
 RECEIVING TO INVENTORY. You CANNOT enter a fractional quantity as it 
 WILL NOT be allowed to be received into Inventory.  Please OK the 
 fractional amount is for a non inventory receipt."
  
  
 Routines: PRCPREC1
  
  
  
 3. HD0000000245950 Purchasing Agents Delinquent Delivery Listing
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When users select option [Delinquent Delivery Listing], all users are
 reported in the report instead of only the Purchasing Agents.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify report option [Delinquent Delivery Listing] to query type of
 Supply Employee (or ALL) desired for report. New Supply Employee query:
  
 Supply Employee type selection: 
  
 1:WAREHOUSE
 2:PPM ACCOUNTABLE OFFICER

 5:PURCHASE CARD HOLDER
 6:ALL OF THE ABOVE
