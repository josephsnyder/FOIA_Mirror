Description:
============

 1. This issue involves the inability of the Approving Official or
    Alternate Approving Official to cancel incomplete Purchase Card (PC) 
    orders.  Currently, only the individual who placed the order can
    cancel the order. If the user who placed the order has left the VA
    there is no proper way to handle the canceling of the order.
  
 2. The issue is a correction to edits of the Edit/Remove 
    Reconciliation [RECONCILIATION  PRCH P.C.O. ED/REMO RECONCILE]
    option which was affecting the Delinquent Approval Report.
  
 3. The issue is with a Source Code Amendment to a purchase order.
    When the Source Code is amended to Federal Contract there is no  
    screen in place to make sure the item on the purchase order has a 
    contract associated with it before approving the amendment.  
  
 4. The issue involves the ability to select inactive Fund 
    Control Points (FCP) when creating Purchase Card Orders.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1.  HD55196     NOP-1298-12590  IFCAP: Cannot cancel incomplete PC Order
  
 Problem:
 -----------
 A site reported the inability of the Approving Official or Alternate 
 Approving Official to cancel incomplete PC orders.  Currently, only the 
 individual who placed the order can cancel the order.  If the user who 
 placed the order has left the VA, there is no proper way to handle the 
 canceling of the order.  
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 The functionality that is used to cancel the PC order by the owner of the 
 order was mimicked to allow the Approving Official or Alternate Approving
 Official to cancel the incomplete order.  The new routine was made into an
 option and placed on the Approving Official Menu [PRCH APPROVE] option.
 There is additional security in place that looks up the key of the user
 who is running the routine before allowing them to cancel the order.
  
 The new option is Cancel Incomplete PC Order - Approving Official [PRCH
 AO CANCEL INCOM PC ORDER].
  
 *NOTE:  After patch installation please ensure the new option has been 
 added to the Approving Official Menu [PRCH APPROVE].
  
 2.  HD55327     Delinquent Approval Report
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 Currently our system allows multiple Oracle Document ID's associated with 
 a Purchase Order to be set to Final Charge.  Whenever a Final Charge is 
 set to a PO, all of the Oracle Documents 'Approval Dates' get updated to 
 the time of the most current Final Charge.  The 'Reconciliation
 Date' gets updated on the most current Final Charge only.  This causes the
 initial Final Charge on the PO to appear as though it is delinquent
 because its Approval Date is greater than 14 days of its Reconciliation
 Date.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 The resolution was not in changing the report but changing the 
 functionality that allows multiple Final Charges on one PO.  A change 
 was to the Input Transform for the FINAL CHARGE (#44) field of the
 PURCHASE CARD ORDER RECONCILE (#440.6) file.
  
  
 3.  HD55282     ISW-0303-23032 SOURCE CODE AMENDMENTS
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 When creating an Amendment to an order, if a Source Code Edit is performed
 and it is changed to 6 Federal Supply Schedule or Other Government 
 Agency (OGA) Contracts, currently the system does not verify that a
 contract is associated with the items.  The system allows the user to
 verify and approve the Amendment with no contract needed.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Changed the Amendment process so that if the Source Code is edited to 6 
 Federal Supply Schedule or Other Government Agencies (OGA) Contracts
 before it can be approved it must have a valid contract associated with
 the item(s).
  
  
 4. HD55484     SAG-0304-40005 Inactive FCP not inactive
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 When creating a Purchase Order users are allowed to select a Fund Control 
 Point that is currently in an inactive status.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Made a change to two routines that are called by the input transform for 
 PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS (#442) file and AMENDMENTS (#443.6)
 file.  This change will check the status of the Fund Control Point (FCP)
 and not allow the user to add an order or make an amendment if the FCP is
 not active.
  
   
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
    
  The revised IFCAP manuals are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
  directories at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field 
  Offices. These files need to be retrieved in binary format.
     
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the 
      first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
        Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
      The documentation distribution includes:
