 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD219085  Option allows PC Orders to avoid Approving Official review.
  
 Problem:

    [PRCH P.C.O. ED/REMO RECONCILE]  
    [PRCH AMENDMENT TO P/C ORDER]
    [PRCH ADUST VOUCH TO P/C ORDER] 
    [PRCH ADJUSTMENT VOUCHER]
    [PRCHPC AMEND]
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines PRCHAMU, PRCH1D and PRCHINQ to prevent a user from
 entering status 'Transaction Complete' when using the following options
 when a Purchase Order has a Method of Payment of "Purchase Card".
  
    [PRCH P.C.O. ED/REMO RECONCILE]  
    [PRCH AMENDMENT TO P/C ORDER]
