Description:
============

 This patch is part of the IFCAP/eCMS Interface project, which is 
 establishing bi-directional communications between the VistA 
 package Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting 
 and Procurement (IFCAP) and the commercial Electronic Contract Management
 System (eCMS) located at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) 
 in Austin Texas. The goal is for the VA to benefit from eCMS's ability to
 consolidate multiple requests, electronically prepare and issue
 solicitation documents, receive electronic offers, automate contract 
 administration, and provide interfaces to the Integrated Acquisition 
 Environment initiatives.
  
 The Phase 1 patch (PRC*5.1*167) created an interface to send via HL7
 messaging a 2237 from IFCAP to eCMS and another HL7 interface to send 2237
 Return or Cancel transactions from eCMS to IFCAP.  This patch makes
 modifications to several existing IFCAP options to support the business 
 process changes required to maintain the interfaces and also implements
 improvements to the Transaction Report - eCMS/IFCAP [PRCHJ TRANS REPORT].
 This is an IFCAP-only patch and does not rely on associated changes in
 eCMS.
  
 Among the enhancements are:
  1. During edit sessions in options New 2237 (Service) Request [PRCSENRB],
     Edit a 2237 (Service) [PRCSEDTD], Change Existing Transaction Number 
     [PRCSANTN], Copy a Transaction [PRCSECP] and Approve Requests
     [PRCSAPP] the software checks if the Requesting Service field is
     populated and each Line Item has an item description.  If not, the
     user is notified and instructed to correct the 2237 before it can move
     to the next level of review.  This will prevent the 2237 from being
     sent to the Accountable Officer with missing field entries.
  
  2. Currently, when an Accountable Officer (AO) attempts to send eCMS a 
     2237 that is missing required data fields, the IFCAP software blocks
     the 2237's transmission and displays a warning message reporting the
     first error encountered, but not any additional errors until the
     previous one has been corrected and transmission re-attempted.  The
     software will now display all required field errors together at one 
     time.  All missing required fields on the 2237 will be output to the
     screen and included in a MailMan message to the AO.  This allows the
     user to correct each error within a single edit session and
     potentially avoid multiple transmission attempts when the 2237 has
     more than one missing required data field.
  
  3. During the building of the HL7 message for the Send 2237 to eCMS
     interface, the hard error due to a missing Line Item Description will
     no longer occur.  The 2237 cannot be forwarded to the Accountable
     Officer for processing if a Line Item Description is missing.
  
  4. A Supply employee identified as Manager also is now able to execute
     the Retransmit a 2237 to eCMS [PRCHJ RETRANS 2237] option on the
     Accountable Officer Menu [PRCHUSER PPM].
  
  5. Three additional user groups can now execute the Transaction Report  
     - eCMS/ IFCAP. A Supply employee identified as Manager now can run the
     report from the Accountable Officer Menu [PRCHUSER PPM]. The report
     can also be run by Fiscal users holding the new security key PRCHJFIS.
     Accounting Technicians will access the report from the Accounting 
     Utilities Menu [PRCFA UTILITY], and Budget Analysts, from the Budget 
     Utilities Menu [PRCB UTILITIES].
  
  6. The interface for 2237 Returned by eCMS and for 2237 Cancelled by
     eCMS will now accept a transaction when the status of the 2237 is one
     of the following: 'Assigned to Purchasing Agent', 'Sent to eCMS
     (P&C)', 'Returned to Service by PPM' or 'Returned To Service by P&C'.
     Previously it would reject the transaction if the 2237's status was
     not 'Sent to eCMS (P&C)'.
  
  7. The existing report Outstanding 2237s [PRCHOUT OUTST 2237/PA] now
     includes 2237s whose status is 'Sent to eCMS (P&C)' and excludes 2237s
     with status 'Returned to Service by eCMS (P&C)', as is appropriate.
  
  8. The eCMS identifier at the 2237 header level has been changed from
     'Sent to eCMS' to 'Accepted by eCMS' to reduce confusion with the
     displayed document's status.  This value is also more accurate as the
     identifier is populated in IFCAP after eCMS successfully imports
     the 2237 into the eCMS database and then sends the internal Purchase
     Request identifier back to IFCAP in the Application Acknowledgment.
     Note:  This change affects all 2237s accepted by eCMS, including
     those that were in the database before Patch 174 was installed.
  
  9. When a 2237 is renumbered using option Change Existing Transaction
     Number [PRCSANTN], the eCMS identifiers (file #410 CONTROL POINT 
     ACTIVITY, field #103 ECMS ACTIONUID and subfile #410.02 ITEM, field
     #100 ITEM UID) are now removed from the entry receiving the new
     transaction number.
  
 10. When the Accountable Officer (AO) in Process a Request in PPM [PRCHPM
     REQST] is editing a 2237 which already has eCMS identifiers, as would
     be the case for a 2237 returned to service by eCMS, edited and then 
     resubmitted to the AO, the AO can only accept the default status of 
     'Pending Accountable Officer Sig.', or change it to one of:  'Returned
     to Service by PPM' or 'Sent to eCMS (P&C)'.  The AO will not be able
     to direct the 2237 elsewhere.
  
 11. When a Control Point User in IFCAP cancels a 2237, or triggers 
     cancellation by changing a 2237's transaction number, the user's
     identity and the date/time of the cancellation are now stored in the 
     2237 record (in the CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file (#410), fields 
     CANCELLED BY (#104) and CANCEL DATE/TIME (#105)). When a Control Point
     User runs the existing Transaction Status Report [PRCSTS] option on
     the Display Control Point Activity Menu [PRCSD], the data in these two
     fields will be displayed for those transactions cancelled after the
     installation of this patch.

      e. Control Point Official's Menu [PRCSCP OFFICIAL]
      f. Purchasing Agent [PRCHUSER PA] 
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 1. Assign the new security key (PRCHJFIS).
  
    The Chief Fiscal Officer should be contacted to identify the
    appropriate Fiscal staff requiring access to the Transaction Report -
    eCMS/IFCAP [PRCHJ TRANS REPORT3] option residing on the Accounting
    Utilities Menu [PRCFA UTILITY] and Budget Utilities Menu [PRCB
    UTILITIES].
  
    Once the appropriate Fiscal staff have been identified, the new
    security key should then be assigned by OIT staff or the IFCAP (Fiscal)
    Application Coordinator.
  
  
 2. Note consequences of fact that: Input template (PRCSENR&NR) is no
    longer compiled.
  
    This patch is exporting the input template (PRCSENR&NR) that is used 
    for creating and editing a 'Repetitive and Non-Repetitive' request in 
    IFCAP.  The input template was previously released as 'compiled' and
    the logic for this template was compiled into a set of routines within
    the PRCST1* namespace.
  
    With the installation of this patch (PRC*5.1*174), the input template 
    will no longer be 'compiled' and the routines associated with the input
    template will not be invoked.  This means that VA FileMan will now run
    off the input template directly instead of the compiled set of routines
    within the PRCST1* namespace.
  
    ***** Please Note *****
    a. If any local code changes were made to the compiled routines 
       associated with this input template, they will no longer be invoked
       or functional. 
  
    b. The set of routines associated with the 'compiled' version of 
       the (PRCSENR&NR) input template may be left on your system or 
       manually deleted.
  
    c. If you intend to manually delete the no-longer-invoked compiled 
       template routines, proceed with caution and consider the following:
  
       - The number of routines generated for the compiled input template
         is specific to the individual VistA instance and is dependent upon
         system settings for maximum compiled routine size.  Therefore,
         this patch does not automatically delete the routines due to the
         potential variation among sites.
  
       - Prior to performing a manual deletion of the PRCST1* routines, it
         is highly recommended that you review each routine to verify it is
         associated with the input template.

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PRC174P
    Before:       n/a   After: B16034261  **174**
 Description of Changes:
  Pre/Post install routine for patch PRC*5.1*174.

Routine Name: PRCHG
    Before: B45716254   After: B46345680  **81,167,174**
 Description of Changes:
  The following changes were made to ES1^PRCHG:
  * Modified logic to output all errors returned from $$SEND2237^PRCHJS01 to
    the screen.
  * Modified logic to log all errors returned from $$SEND2237^PRCHJS01 in
    the IFCAP/ECMS TRANSACTION file (#414.06) via the LOG^PRCHJTA API.
  * Modified logic to include all errors returned from $$SEND2237^PRCHJS01
    in the error notification mail message to Accountable Officer.
   
  The following change was made to STAT^PRCHG, which is called by the input 
  transform of the CURRENT STATUS field (#1.5) of the REQUEST WORKSHEET 
  file (#443):
  * If the 2237 has eCMS identifiers, the DIC("S") screen is set to only
    allow selection of a status of "Sent to eCMS (P&C)" (69), "Returned to
    Service by PPM" (63), or "Pending Accountable Officer Sig." (60).

Routine Name: PRCHJMSG
    Before: B10009804   After: B13099425  **167,174**
 Description of Changes:
  In module BLD where messages are being addressed to the Accountable
  Officer, Control Point Official, and/or Requestor when a 2237 is returned
  or canceled, a check was added to make sure that the appropriate field is
  populated before setting up the XMY array entry in order to prevent a
  potential null subscript error.  This check became more critical when the
  software processing the incoming HL7 transaction was changed to accept
  transactions for 2237s whose status is "Returned to Service by PPM" or
  "Returned To Service by P&C".  Those earlier returns would have removed
  signatures and pointer values to the NEW PERSON file (#200).

Routine Name: PRCHJR01
    Before:B143518446   After:B172209901  **167,174**
 Description of Changes:
  In module PARSE added path for a return to service by eCMS where the 2237 
  had already been returned to service by the Accountable Officer or the 
  IFCAP Ordering Officer. Similarly added a path for cancel from eCMS where
  the 2237 has previously been returned to service by the Accountable
  Officer or IFCAP Ordering Officer.
   
  In module RET2AO added logic to delete the IFCAP Ordering Officer's NEW 
  PERSON file (#200) reference and date/time value from the PURCHASING AGENT
  field (#6) and the DATE ASSIGNED TO PA field (#7) respectively of the 
  REQUEST WORKSHEET file (#443) if a 2237 is being returned to the 
  Accountable Officer by eCMS.
   
  In module VALIDATE changed the logic to accept the incoming 2237 
  return to service by eCMS or cancel transaction if the 2237 in IFCAP has a
  status of "Sent to eCMS (P&C)", "Assigned to Purchasing Agent", "Returned
  To Service by P&C", or "Returned to Service by PPM".  Previously, the
  logic would reject the transaction unless the 2237 was in status "Sent to
  eCMS (P&C)".  Also added check to reject an incoming return to 
  Accountable Officer transaction if the current status of the 2237 is 
  "Returned To Service by P&C" or "Returned to Service by PPM".  This is 
  necessary as the Control Point Official signature had been removed by 
  the previous return and the 2237 has to be resubmitted to the Control 
  Point Official for review and approval before going back to the 
  Accountable Officer.
   
  In the text table following tag ERRTABLE:

    transaction is resubmitted to eCMS it will be treated as a new Purchase 
    Request and assigned new eCMS identifiers.  The old identifiers would be
    retired.
  * A DIE call was added to file in the CANCELLED BY field (#104) of the 
    CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file (#410) entry the user who cancelled the
    old transaction number. By the trigger cross reference on field #104,
    the CANCEL DATE/TIME field (#105) is also populated.
