Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 1. Involves the addition of a new Federal Supply Classification (FSC) 
    Code to the FEDERAL SUPPLY CLASSIFICATION (#441.2) file.
  
 2. A correction to an improper reference to the Vendor Product Number
    during the transmission of the Electronic Request for Quotation
    (RFQ).
  
 3. A new option Purge All Code Sheets [PRCHPM CS PURGE ALL] was 
    created to clean out all record types in the CALM/LOG CODE SHEET 
    (#423) file and CALM/LOG TRANSMISSION RECORD (#421.2) file for a 
    given time frame. This is needed to clean up old data.
    Also, the following printer assignment note was added:
    **YOU MUST SELECT A DESIGNATED PRINTER FOR PURGE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.
    ** DEFAULTING TO HOME DEVICE (0) WILL NOT PURGE DATA SINCE THE OPTION

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1.  HD55333     FSC CODE TO BE ADDED TO FILE
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 Missing a Federal Supply Classification from the FEDERAL SUPPLY 
 CLASSIFICATION (#441.2) file.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Add the new FSC 4235 to FEDERAL SUPPLY CLASSIFICATION (#441.2) file.
  
  
 2.  HD55337     VENDOR PRODUCT # NOT SEEN IN ELECTRONIC RFQ
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 During the transmission of the Request For Quotation (RFQ) to Austin we 
 are not sending the Vendor Product Number field.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 The code that builds the RFQ has been changed to include the VENDOR 
 PRODUCT NBR (#1) field from the RFQ LINE ITEM (#444.026) file 
 which is a subfile of the REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (#444) file.
  
  
 3.  HD122874    History of Receiving Reports Inaccurate
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 The problem is not with the report but with the data the report is trying 
 to display.  Certain records in the CALM/LOG CODE SHEET (#423) file have 
 incorrect Release Validation Date/Time values.  The year for the dates is
 10 years off.  The problem is these records do not get archived/purged 
 and when new records with the exact same batch numbers are entered, it 
 does not overwrite the existing record's Date/Time value.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 There is an existing option (Purge Code Sheets (LOG/GSA/DLA) [PRCHPM CS 
 PURGE]) that allows the user to purge the CALM/LOG CODE SHEET (#423) file
 for certain types of records.  The code was modified to allow the purging
 of all record types in CALM/LOG CODE SHEET (#423) file and a new option
 Purge All Code Sheets [PRCHPM CS PURGE ALL] was created and attached to
 menu PRCHPM CS BATCH MANAGEMENT. The following code sheets will be purged:
 CLM, CLI, RR, LOG, DLA, PHA & GSA.
  
 Also, the following printer assignment note was added:
  
 ** YOU MUST SELECT A DESIGNATED PRINTER FOR PURGE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. 
 ** DEFAULTING TO HOME DEVICE (0) WILL NOT PURGE DATA SINCE THE OPTION
 ** WILL BE TASKED.
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
  
 The following IFCAP manuals were updated to reflect the addition of a 
 new option Purge All Code Sheets [PRCHPM CS PURGE ALL] which was created
 to clean out all record types in the CALM/LOG CODE SHEET (#423) file and
 CALM/LOG TRANSMISSION RECORD (#421.2) file for a given time frame.
   
 The revised IFCAP manuals are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directories at one of the following Offices of Information (OI) Field 
 Offices. These files need to be retrieved in binary format.
    
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
   
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the 
     first available FTP server.
    
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
    
       Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
       Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
       Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
    
     The documentation distribution includes:
