 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000853051 Cannot remove secondary from Primary Inventory
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    When a user is in the Primary Inventory Point Main Menu [PRCP MAIN 
    MENU] to delete a secondary inventory point, the action works
    correctly. If the user tries to add a new secondary inventory point
    after the delete, the new secondary inventory point would have the
    incorrect site attached to the secondary name.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the secondary inventory point delete/deactivate process, to 
    insure the original site remains after removing all links to Fund
    Control Points, for the deleted secondary inventory point.
  
 Routines: PRCPUINV
  
  
 2. INC000000842129 2237 Request Display missing comments
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site using option 2237 Request Display [PRCH REQ DSP] to display the
    2237 (Service) Request for a purchase order, would find at times that
    comments did not display, which was critical for split requisitions.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine to display requisition for Accountable Officer, 
    Purchasing Agent, and Comments regardless of whether or not the 2237
    requisition has a status entry in file Request Worksheet (#443).
  
 Routines: PRCHDR
  
  
 3. INC000000707554 Obligations not showing on Running Balance
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user obligates an order, they will at times be able to escape 
    the obligation process before the Control Point Activity (#410) file, 
    filing has been completed.  This prevents the obligated dollar amount
    of an order from showing on the site Running Balance report.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the routine PRCFAC02, to insure the Control Point Activity 
    (#410) file obligation process filing is complete before any print 
    requests within the obligation process are allowed.
