Subject: NIF MAINT ERRORS MAIL GROUP;RUNNING BALANCE REPORT AND FCP RECALCULATIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 2 issues:
  
 1. If an NIF (National Item File) maintenance error occurs, an e-mail is
 being sent to Outlook e-mail group 'VHA NIF Maintenance Office@va.gov'
 when it should be going to 'VHANIFMO', which is the SMTP address for VHA
 NIF Maintenance Office.
  
 2. When running the Running Balance report or recalculating FCP balances,
 the logic (using the 'RB' cross reference) does not pick up all entries
 tied to a RB key, instead it only picks up the first entry.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000392303 IFCAP NIF maintenance errors mail message to Outlook
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The IFCAP Outlook mail group provided by IFCAP development staff for NIF
 (National Item File) Maintenance errors was incorrectly specified as
 'VHA NIF Maintenance Office@va.gov'.  Parallel forwarded emails from
 Lyford Greene to designated mail group disguised the actual mail 
 messages on production accounts.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the Outlook mail group for NIF Maintenance errors to 
 'VHANIFMO', which is the SMTP address for VHA NIF Maintenance Office'.
 Also, changed sending mail user to 'Postmaster'.

 2. HD0000000395103 Running Balance report problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During monthly Carry Forward processing or adjustments to previous quarter
 transactions it is possible that a transaction entry in Control Point 
 Activity file (#410) can have a duplicate entry in the 'RB' cross
 reference file that controls the printing of the Running Balance report.
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified code to check for multiple entries under 'RB' cross reference to 
 insure all activity under duplicate entry is reported.  Also, corrected 
 code to insure single or all Fund Control Point recalculations were
 following the same logic for multiple entries under the same 'RB' cross
 reference.
