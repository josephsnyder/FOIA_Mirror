Subject: IFCAP MAINTENANCE PATCH 112

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch fixes the following:
 a)  A rounding problem with some of the numbers in the CLO GIP
     REPORTS (CLRS) report.
 b)  A <SYNTAX> error when a line item list doesn't exactly match
     the requested format.
 c)  A Mumps cross reference in file 420.14 (PRCD FUND) which was
     causing wrong records to be pulled up.
 Details below.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1.  HD182464 - Percentages not matching the Stock Status Rpt w/CLRS
   
 Problem:
 -----------
 There is a slight discrepancy in the numbers reported by the STOCK STATUS
 REPORT  [PRCP STOCK STATUS REPORT] and the CLO GIP REPORTS (CLRS)  [PRCPLO
 CLO GIP OPTION].  The problem relates to the usage of rounding in one report
 and truncating to two digits in the other report.  This can cause some of
 the numbers to be off by a penny when the reports are compared.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The fix for this is to modify the Stock Status Report to use rounding as
 is done in the CLO GIP report.
   
 Items affected:  routine PRCPLO2A
   
   
 2.  HD205295 - ERROR - <SYNTAX>N+3^PRCHNPO3
   
 Problem:
 -----------
 When adding a 2237 to a purchase order the user is prompted for a list of
 item numbers.  The acceptable format is n,n,n... where n is any item number
 or is an item number followed by a colon followed by another item number
 ( e.g. 5:9 ).  For example:  1,3,5:9,12 would be accepted.  Failure to
 follow that format results in a beep and a re-prompt for the entry unless
 the mistake is to enter more than one comma in a row ( e.g. 1,,3,5 ).  In
 that case the user receives the <SYNTAX> error and the job is aborted.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PRCHNPO3 is modified to detect the consecutive commas and change
 them to a single comma.  This allows the processing to continue normally.
   
 Items affected:  routine PRCHNPO3
   
   
 3.  HD193872 - Extra years added to FMS Exceptions Report
   
 Problem:
 -----------
 When selecting or printing from the PRCD FUND file [#420.14] extra entries
 are displayed that are not associated with the selected fund.  This is 
 caused by a non-standard cross reference that is causing confusion for
 FileMan.  The problem only becomes evident when the number of entries in
 file #420.14 exceeds 1,973.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The solution is to delete the old "UNQ" cross reference and replace it
 with a New Style cross reference which will provide the same functionality
 and be compatible with FileMan.  The patch will remove the old cross
 reference, install new field definitions with the new cross reference and
 rebuild the index.
   
 Items affected:  PRCD FUND file [#420.14], fields:
    .01  FUND
    2    BUDGET FISCAL YEAR BEGIN
    3    BUDGET FISCAL YEAR END
