Description:
============

 1. This issue involves the phone number extension in ELECTRONIC
    SIGNATURE BLOCKS.  Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point
    Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) software is set up to
    display a 4 digit extension but some sites now have a 5 digit
    extension.  The new 5 digit extension causes the number to not be
    displayed.
  
 2. This issue involves an issue with adding a Generic Inventory
    point through the Manager For Supply Warehouse Inventory Point Menu 
    [MANAGER FOR SUPPLY WAREHOUSE I] option.
  
 3. This issue is updating the PROMPT PAY TYPE (#4) field in the
    INVOICE TRACKING (#421.5) file.  This Prompt Pay Type needs to match 
    the Financial Management System (FMS) PPAY Table.  Currently, it
    does not.
  
 4. This issue involves the inability to delete partial orders in
    a given state.  The problem is not with the functionality, but with
    the error message that is displayed.  Currently when the user tries 
    to delete they get a beep and "??".  The user should see a valid 
    error message properly explaining the issue.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1.  HD154874    Signature of Initiator - Question
  
 Problem:
 -----------
 A site reported an issue involving the phone number extension in 
 ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE BLOCKS.  IFCAP software is setup to display a 4 
 digit extension, but some sites now have a 5 digit extension.  The new 5 
 digit extension causes the number to not be displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 The code that handles the display of the phone extension was altered to 
 make room for the new 5-digit extensions.
  
  
 2.  HD55230     ISW-0601-20223 GIP Inventory Point Referencing Wrong   
                 Station Number
  
 Problem:
 -----------
 A former IFCAP developer reported an issue that involves adding a 
 Generic Inventory point through the Manager For Supply Warehouse 
 Inventory Point Menu.  A user is allowed to add the inventory point with 
 a station number prefix that does not match the current station.  
 Example:  For station 552 the proper naming convention should be 
 552-something.  However, the user was allowed to add 600-something.  
 After the addition of the inventory point the user cannot access it 
 through this option because of a screen that is placed on the lookup that 
 does not allow the user to look at inventory points that don't have the 
 correct station prefix.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 In order to properly handle this problem a change was made to the data 
 dictionary that will enforce the proper station naming-convention when 
 adding a new Generic Inventory entry.
  
  
 3.  HD55343     CAH-0103-30439 IFCAP & FMS codes do not match-items are 
                 being rejected
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 In the INVOICE TRACKING (#421.5) file there is a field called PROMPT PAY
 TYPE (#4) which currently contains values that are not consistent with the
 Financial Management System (FMS) database.  When we send transactions to
 FMS if the PROMPT PAY TYPE (#4) field does not match what is in the FMS
 PPAY Table, the transaction is rejected.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 The values for PROMPT PAY TYPE (#4) field in INVOICE TRACKING (#421.5) 
 file are being updated to match the values in the FMS PPAY Table.
  
  
 4. HD55536     POR-0504-51067 Can't delete a receiving report partial
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 Currently when a user tries to delete a partial order on a Purchase Order
 there is a beep and two "??" displayed to the user.  If the user is not
 allowed to delete the partial order, a better message needs to be
 displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 When a partial order is not allowed to be deleted the user will hear a
 beep and the following message will be displayed:
  
 "Receiving Report cannot be deleted, please create an adjustment voucher."
