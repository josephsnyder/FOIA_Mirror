 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000264524 FGH - QT Adjustment for GIP Item - Reason Text
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users are receiving the last Reason Text as default when running
 Enter/Edit Inventory Item Data [PRCP EDIT INVENTORY ITEMS] option.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines to not allow default of previous Reason Text entry
 from the user's previous entry queue and always asks Reason Text
 as required.
  
 Routines: PRCPEIQT, PRCPAWU0
  
  
  
 2. HD0000000265818 [Purchase Card Information List] option not working
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Purchase Card Information List [PRCH CARD - INFO] option does not
 display Purchase Card Names starting with numerics. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify sort template PRCH CARD INFOSORT for file PURCHASE CARD INFORMATION
 (#440.5) to pull all Purchase Card Name entries rather than A-Z.  Added
 parameter to ask From/To for Purchase Card Name.
  
  
  
 3. HD0000000129600 <SUBSCRIPT>ST+6^PRCHDP3 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A SUBSCRIPT error is caused when a user enters an adjustment for a second
 time after making a receipt zero from a previous adjustment. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the routine to check that a quantity of zero entered against a
 received quantity of 0 are in fact equal when the entered quantity is
 defaulted to null.  Also, ensure that at least one adjustment to 
 receiving has actually been done before passing to filing of adjustment.
