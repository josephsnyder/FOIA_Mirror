 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000837673 IFCAP-Purchase Card Accrual Issue:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When site runs the Generate/Rebuild FMS SV-Document off the  
    Compiled/Print Monthly Accrual in the Accrual (Monthly) [PRCB MONTHLY 
    ACCRUAL] option, a Cost Center (ex. 615322) will be entered in the
    Service Voucher (SV) document as 615322 in the Cost Center field and 22
    in the Sub Cost Center field looking like this:
  
    LIN^~SVA^008^CC^94^^4537B^^688^^615322^22^016144101^2696^^^^^^^^^^
    220^~SVB^27.00^D^^E^
  
    This causes the document to be rejected by Financial Management 
    Systems (FMS) when transmitted.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the SV Document processing for Cost Center and Sub Cost Center
    to set the full cost center into the Cost Center field and '00' in the
    Sub Cost Center field like so:
  
    LIN^~SVA^008^CC^94^^4537B^^688^^615322^00^016144101^2696^^^^^^^^^^
    220^~SVB^27.00^D^^E^

 2. INC000000825983 IFCAP-Other: File 442 IEN DINUM Setting Control
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Entries related to Federal Procurement Data System FPDS data sets
    into the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS (#442) file cause
    entries to be written with a very low internal entry number (IEN). This
    will ultimately cause sites to run out of valid numbers >0 and freeze
    all order processing, as no new orders can be created in PROCUREMENT &
    ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS (#442) file.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify tag/routine EN8^PRCHNPO6 to check for an IEN below 20,000,000
    and logically reset the number back to the last determined highest
    number used for this descending ordered file and insuring the new 
    valid number is then entered into the file node 0, counter field.
  
 Routines: PRCHNPO6
  
  
 3. INC000000840828 IFCAP-1358 Issue:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user repeatedly adjusts (max 9,999,999.99 increments allowed)
    a 1358 and the adjusted 1358 exceeds $99,999,999.99 an incorrect 
    Service Order (SO) document will be sent to FMS having the amount of
    the preceding adjustment, not the adjustment amount that caused the
    $999,999,999.99 overrun.
  
    Problem analysis and testing also uncovered error conditions due to
    the following fields in the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS
    (#442) file having maximum value errors:
   
    SUBAMOUNT1 (#3.4) field (max value of 9999999)
    NET AMOUNT (#92) field  (max value of 99999999)
    LIQUIDATED AMOUNT (#93) field (max value of 99999999)
  
    Failure of these fields to update also caused TOTAL AMOUNT (#91) field,
    ACTUAL 1358 BALANCE (#94) field and ESTIMATED COST (#7.2) field to not
    update correctly.
  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify Data Dictionary for PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS (#442)
    file, SUBAMOUNT1 (#3.4) field, NET AMOUNT (#92) field, and LIQUIDATED
    AMOUNT (#93) field to have maximum value of 999,999,999, and 2 decimal
    digits.
  
    Modify CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY (#410) file, ADJUSTMENT $ AMOUNT (#25) 
    field and TRANSACTION $ AMOUNT (#27) field to have valid entry between
    -9,999,999 and 9,999,999,and 2 decimal digits. Also, COMMITTED  
    (ESTIMATED) COST (#20) field to have valid entry between 0 and
    9,999,999, and 2 decimal digits.
  
    Routines:  None
