 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000264029 File 421.9 included in annual purge
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It was discovered that during the annual purge, INVOICE PARTIAL COUNTER
 file (#421.9) entries linked to the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS 
 file (#442) are not being purged.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines to insure linked INVOICE PARTIAL COUNTER file (#421.9)
 entries are purged when the linked Purchase Order is purged from
 PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS file (#442). Also, a post install
 routine was written to purge all previously skipped INVOICE PARTIAL 
 COUNTER file (#421.9) entries that have no links to PROCUREMENT & 
 ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS file (#442) Purchase Order.
  
  
 Routines: PRCG237P, PRCGARP1, PRCF131P 
  
  
 2. HD0000000267471 Control Point dollar amount errors
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When users run the option [Summary Report of Unpaid PC Transactions] the 
 dollar amounts are too high for the Fund Control Points reported. This 
 happens because the compilation process includes cancelled orders and
 shouldn't.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine to insure that the cancelled order dollar amounts are not 
 compiled for the report Fund Control points.
  
 Routines: PRCHRP3 
  
  
 3. HD0000000186653 Purchase Order Display - multiple amendments 
                    show description text for only last amendment 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a purchase order is amended multiple times, the message "**Will
 now be AMENDED to read:" portion of each amendment  matches the last
 amendment instead of the amendment that was changed in the quantity and
 dollars fields.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PRCHDP6 to locate the previous amendment (if any) and use
 the information from that amendment to report the "Will now be AMENDED to
 read" data.     
  
  
 Routines: PRCHDP2, PRCHDP5, PRCHDP6
