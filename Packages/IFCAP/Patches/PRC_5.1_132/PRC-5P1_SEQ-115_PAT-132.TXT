Subject: HISTORY OF ITEM DISPLAY PROBLEM;ORDER FORM PROBLEM;REPORT ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1. When using the option [PRCH ITEM HIST], under query "ITEM MASTER
    NUMBER", and the user exits the option with an up-arrow (^), the user
    is not always returned to "ITEM MASTER NUMBER".  Also, when looking at
    subsequent items in the same process, the user is required to press
    ENTER an extra time before any data is displayed.
  
 2. When using option [PRCP CATALOG/ORDER FORM PRINT] and the header 'Main
    Storage Location' is on the bottom of the screen, the first line of
    data on the next page concatenates off the end of the header.
  
 3. When using option [PRCHOUT PAM] and sending to a printer, some printers
    encounter an overflow of the header.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000164462 - Jumping to option [History of Item Display/Print]
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Under query "ITEM MASTER NUMBER" when using the option [PRCH ITEM HIST]
    there are times when exiting the option (^), the user is not returned
    to "ITEM MASTER NUMBER".  Also, when looking at subsequent items, the
    user is required to press ENTER an extra time before any data is
    displayed.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine PRCHRPT1 to properly exit the option when an up-arrow
    (^) is encountered and also not require an extra ENTER if looking at
    multiple items.
  
    Routines: PRCHRPT1
  
  
 2. HD0000000190384 - Order Form [PRCP CATALOG/ORDER FORM PRINT] problem
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When sites print a catalog order and the header 'Main Storage Location'
    is on the bottom of the screen, the first line of data on the next page
    concatenates off the end of the header.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine PRCPRCAT to insert a line feed after the main heading
    prints to ensure the item information begins on a new line.
  
    Routines: PRCPRCAT
  
  
 3. HD0000000199116 - Report Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using option [PRCHOUT PAM] and printing to a printer which uses 12
    CPI formatting, lines containing 97 or more characters will overflow.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routines PRCHPAM and PRCHPAM1 to only print a maximum of 96
    characters per line.
  
    Routines: PRCHPAM, PRCHPAM1
