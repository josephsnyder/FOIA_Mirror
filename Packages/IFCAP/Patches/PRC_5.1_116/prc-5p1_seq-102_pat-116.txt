Description:
============

 This patch changes the prompt for Purge All Code Sheets [PRCHPM
 CS PURGE ALL] option from number of days to an exact retention
 date.  It also adds a field to the FEDERAL SUPPLY CLASSIFICATION (#441.2)
 file.  This patch also contains logic to remove missing codes: PRC, FEE,
 IRS, ISN, FEN and CAP from the CALM/LOG CODE SHEET (#423) file while
 running Purge All Code Sheets [PRCHPM CS PURGE ALL] option.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD235832  TEST PATCH PRC*5.1*114v3
  
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 When running Purge Code Sheets (LOG/GSA/DLA) [PRCHPM CS PURGE]
 and Purge All Code Sheets [PRCHPM CS PURGE ALL] options the purge criteria
 asks for number of days to determine records to be purged. It is virtually
 impossible to determine the correct number of days to garner date desired
 when it encompasses many years in the past.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Modify routine PRCFACPR to ask for exact retention date in lieu of number
 of days. 
  
  
 2. HD235242  FSC code addition to FEDERAL SUPPLY CLASSIFICATION (#441.2)
    file.
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 Missing a Federal Supply Classification (FSC) from the FEDERAL SUPPLY
 CLASSIFICATION (#441.2) file.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Add the new FSC 5331 O-RINGS to FEDERAL SUPPLY CLASSIFICATION (#441.2)
 file using new routine PRCIN116. Also, redefined FSC 4235 Hazardous
 Material Spill to conform to internal file number being the same as
 the FSC code.
  
  
 3.  HD241369  Entries remaining in CALM/LOG CODE SHEET (#423) file
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 Entries still remain in CALM/LOG CODE SHEET (#423) file after running 
 Purge All Code Sheets [PURGE ALL CODE SHEETS] option. Code logic was
 missing the following codes: PRC, FEE, IRS, ISM, FEN, CAP.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Modify routine PRCFALOG to include the missing codes when running Purge 
 All Code Sheets [PURGE ALL CODE SHEETS] option. Also, modify routine
 PRCFACPS to denote "all codes" being deleted as part of the report
 information. Also, awoke check to look for any dangling cross references
 that may have been left behind and purge them from file if master 
 transaction record previously purged.
