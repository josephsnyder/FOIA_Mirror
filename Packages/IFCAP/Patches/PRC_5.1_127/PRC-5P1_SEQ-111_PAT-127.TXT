Subject: GIP TRANSACTION REGISTER REPORT;GIP ISSUE;PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Site can only run the option [PRCP TRANSACTION REG REPORT] one month at
    a time. Need to allow the users to enter a From and To month period of
    time to report multiple months in a single run.
  
 2. User is experiencing an issue with the GIP (Generic Inventory Package).
    When making a manual adjustment for an item with zero on hand, if only
    updating on hand quantity the inventory value remains at 0. This causes
    negative inventory values with subsequent distributions. Will modify 
    the QT (Quantities) action code of option [Enter/Edit Inventory].
  
 3. Fiscal user that ran the option [PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL] reported a 
    document transmission less than the compiled report dollars. Will 
    install file LOCK protection to insure compile completes before any
    other steps can be executed.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000288161 GIP Transaction Register Report print limitation
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site can only run one month at a time when running option [TRANSACTION
 REGISTER REPORT]. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify reporting process to allow user to enter a From/To month period of
 time to report multiple months in a single run. 
  
  
 Routines: PRCPRTRA, PRCPRTR1
  
  
 2. HD0000000286684 GIP Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 User is experiencing an issue with the GIP. When making a manual 
 adjustment for an item with zero on hand, if only updating on hand
 quantity the inventory value remains at 0 (along with the average cost).
 This causes negative inventory value with subsequent distributions.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify QT action code of option [Enter/Edit Inventory] to require entry
 of an inventory value when increasing on hand from zero to new amount. If
 the user is updating a zero value inventory item they will be asked to 
 verify that they are updating only on-hand quantity on a zero value 
 inventory item.

 3. HD0000000264196 PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Fiscal user that ran the option [PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL] reported a 
 document transmission less than the compiled report dollars.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Analysis determined that user ran option [PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL] for step
 '1 Compile/Print Monthly Accrual' by tasking to a printer and IMMEDIATELY 
 ran step '3 Generate/Rebuild FMS SV-Document' before the compile had 
 completed in the tasked option.  Installed file LOCK protection to insure 
 compile has completed before any other steps can be executed.
