 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000271432  IFCAP: Purchase Card prefix issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs has changed the charge card vendor from
 Citibank (4486*) to US Bank (4716*). 
  
 1. Modify the [PRCH INACTIVATE EXP CHAR CARD] option to task new process
    that will inactivate any active Citibank cards (with a 4486 preface)
    and any US Bank cards reaching their expiration date.
  
    ** Task needs to be setup initially for the night of 11/30/2008 @01:00 
       (which is the anticipated change over date to new US Bank cards) and
       monthly for any outstanding Citibank cards missed in the first
       pass and for US Bank cards reaching their expiration date.
  
 2. Create a new report [Purchase Card exceptions/replacements] option on
    the [PRCH CARD COORDINATOR MENU] option that will report three types of
    old and new purchase card exceptions previously using Fileman print 
    processing.
  
    a. Citibank cards without US Bank replacement card
    b. All active Citibank cards with NO new US Bank replacement card
    c. All inactive Citibank cards WITH new US Bank replacement cards
  
 3. Modify the report [CCR Charge Card Reg. Exception] option on the
    [PRCH CARD COORDINATOR MENU] option to insure ALL Purchase Card
    Registration exceptions are listed for sites selected.
  
 4. Add a new query to the [PURCHASE CARD REGISTRATION] option that will
    allow users to enter a 'REPLACED CARD' value. This insures the link
    between the new card and the replaced card for charge reconciliation
    crossovers on old orders against replaced cards when charges come
    through under the new card number.
  
    This 'REPLACED CARD' number MUST be a valid card number, inactive, not
    used as a replacement card for another card and match the new card for
    the following fields: CARD HOLDER, STATION NUMBER, FUND CONTROL POINT,
    COST CENTER and BUDGET OBJECT CODE.
  
 5. Increase field length for Field 4 (Bank's Vendor ID) in File 440.6
    [PURCHASE CARD ORDER RECONCILE] from 9 to 11.
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. Modify PRCH3A used by the [Inactivate Expired Charge cards] option
    on the [PRCH CARD COORDINATOR MENU] option. This option will be tasked.
    Initially, the option MUST BE scheduled to run on November 30, 2008 at
    0100 (1 am). There is an internal date check in the routine
    that will NOT ALLOW the process to inactivate cards if the date is not
    after November 29, 2008 at 5:00 PM.
  
    This option can be scheduled to run monthly using the Task Manager.
    Instructions on how to schedule this task are in Step 8 of the
    Installation Instructions.
  
 2. Create new routine PRCH4RPT that will be used by the new [Purchase
    Card exceptions/replacements] option on the [PRCH CARD COORDINATOR 
    MENU] option that will allow the user to print exceptions/replacements
    reports previously run through Fileman print option. This user friendly
    option will allow three types of reports:
  
      1.   ALL Citibank cards with No US Bank replacement #
      2.   Active Citibank cards with No US Bank replacement #
      3.   Inactive Citibank cards with US Bank replacement #
  
 3. Modify routine PRCH2A to insure all Purchase Card registration 
    exceptions will be listed for site.  
  
 **Reconciliation [PRCH P.C.O. RECONCILIATION] option under the
   Reconciliation Menu [PRCH RECONCILE MENU] option will continue to locate
   purchase card orders and reconcile them to selected charges even if the
   order has the original card number and the charge has the replacement
   card number. When reconciling by purchase card order, the option will
   look up the related charges and reconcile even if the charge and the
   order involve both old and new card numbers.
