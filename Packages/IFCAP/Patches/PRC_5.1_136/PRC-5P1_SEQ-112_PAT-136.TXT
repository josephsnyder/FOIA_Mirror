Subject: Code Set Versioning Compliance Updates

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The passing of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  (HIPAA) stipulated that diagnostic and procedure codes and terms used
  for billing purposes must be the codes and terms that were applicable
  at the time the service was provided.  
  
  In October 2003, certain fields in the VistA ICD Diagnosis, ICD Procedures, 
  CPT, and CPT Modifier standard tables were identified as obsolete and to
  be replaced with newer data elements implementing data versioning in 
  these tables.   
  
  Under the Code Set Versioning Project, the code names, descriptions,
  inactive flags and dates were replaced by versioned data elements,
  each with an effective date of use.  
  
  VA software packages who used the ICD/CPT files were provided with Code Set
  Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) to retrieve the new data and
  instructed to discontinue the use of the old un-versioned data elements.
  
  In July 2006, after a significant impact analysis of known usage conducted
  by the development team, the VistA DBA approved the scheduled deletion
  of the obsolete data elements in the following files:
  
      ICD Diagnosis              (#80)                ^ICD9(
      ICD Operation/Procedure    (#80.1)              ^ICD0(
      CPT                        (#81)                ^ICPT(
      CPT Modifier               (#81.3)              ^DIC(81.3, 
  
  This patch updates the IFCAP software so that it is in compliance with
  the Code Set Versioning Project. 
  
  The following options have been modified to now display CPT (Current
  Procedural Terminology) codes and the short description of the code
  using the version applicable on the date the service was provided:
  
     Operation Code-Case Cart Link Report [PRCP CC OPCODE-CC LINK REPORT]
     Distribution Order Processing [PRCP DIST ORDER PROCESSING]
     Enter/Edit Surgical Case Cart Request [PRCP SURGERY ORDER]
  
  The following option is modified to now display the CPT code using
  the version applicable on the date the service was provided:
  
     Patient Distribution Cost Report [PRCP PATIENT DISTR COST REPORT]

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD309562     GIP references field #2 CPT file (#81) which will be deleted
      
 Problem:
 --------
  This help desk ticket was entered after a review of the IFCAP software
  revealed that the software had unsupported references to CPT codes and
  therefore not in compliance with directives laid out by the Code Set 
  Versioning Project.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  This patch updates the IFCAP software by replacing existing references
  to CPT codes and descriptions with supported references which retrieve
  versioned CPT codes and descriptions in compliance with instructions
  from the Code Set Versioning Project.
