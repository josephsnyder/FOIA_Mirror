ACTION DUE: 24 hours from release

ACTION REQUIRED: Install PRCHDISCNT.KID file


PURPOSE:  Restoration of pre-patch input template PRCHDISCNT via a host
file (PRCHDISCNT.KID) to correct identified errors associated with patch
PRC*5.1*189 that could impact patient care.

Forum message #73546428 instructed sites to back out patch PRC*5.1*189
and restore their systems to the pre-patch routines.  This can be 
accomlished via the backup message created as part of the patch install
process.  However, this would not restore the pre-patch input template.

Future patch PRC*5.1*191 will be the replacement patch for PRC*5.1*189.


BACKGROUND:  
 
On 5/1/15 patch PRC*5.1*189 AUTHORIZATION/LIQUIDATION ISSUE;MULTIPLE 
RECEIPT ALLOWED;PROMPT PAY HANDLING was released nationally. This patch 
modified 4 existing routines (PRCHREC, PRCSUT3, PRCHMA2, PRCHNPO1) added 
one new routine (PRCHNPOC) and modified input template (PRCHDISCNT).

The week of 6/22/15 two issues were reported by the facilities; one with 
the Add New Transaction (Ceiling)' [PRCB ADD NEW TRANSACTION] option that 
affected sites who had reached the limit of 9999 for ceiling 
transactions. The system would not restart the counter to XXXFC0000, as a 
result duplicate numbers displayed on the Running Balance report. The 
other issue with the 'Transfer From/To Control Point' [PRCB SINGLE 
TRANSFER] would not set a required variable causing users to receive an 
'Unable to Make Entry in File 410.1, Further Processing Terminated.   
Contact your Site Manager' error.

On 6/29/15 the Status of Patch field for PRC*5.1*189 was set to Entered 
in Error on Forum and a Heads-Up message was generated to the sites 
advising them to back out patch PRC*5.1*189. But the backup only restored 
the four pre-existing routines and not the Input Template PRCHDISCNT. 
Sites then began reporting an issue with Prime Vendor related orders 
(i.e. Cardinal Health, etc.) and Open Market.  The restored routine 
PRCHNPOC required the previous version of the PRCHDISCNT input template 
to allow sites to complete the Prompt Pay actions.

This issue could directly affect patient care, due to the type of 
orders/supplies being purchased. Sites are required to install the 
PRCHDISCNT. KID build, which contains the correct input template to allow 
sites to process the PRIME VENDOR and OPEN MARKET orders.


 
INSTRUCTIONS TO RESTORE INPUT TEMPLATE:

STEP 1:   Download KIDS build titled PRCHDISCNT.KID and 
          PRCHDISCNT_INSTRUCTIONS.TXT


Host File Retrieval:
--------------------
Sites may retrieve the hostfile and text file in one of the following
ways:

(1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
     download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files 
     from the first available FTP server.

(2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from the 
     ANONYMOUS SOFTWARE DIRECTORY from a specific server as follows:

     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.domain.ext
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext

     The host file distribution includes: 
   
     File Name                      Description           Retrieval Format
     =========                      ===========           ================
     PRCHDISCNT.KID                 Input Template        ASCII
     PRCHDISCNT_INSTRUCTIONS.TXT    Install Instructions  ASCII


 
Step 2: Install PRCHDISCNT.KID within 24 hours.
