 INC5590253 - FMBT project requires IFCAP User Counts report 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 IFCAP stakeholders have requested that menu option, IFCAP Users By Roles 
 Counts [PRCHUSER ROLE COUNTS], be added so that users can schedule a  
 MailMan message with a breakdown of all IFCAP users by their roles and 
 how many roles there are.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine, PRC5129, has been modified to add menu option, IFCAP Users By
 Roles Counts [PRCHUSER ROLE COUNTS]. Changes were also done to this
 routine to remove possible errors when running the national option. It is 
 recommended that this option is run at the first of every month. The 
 IFCAP Technical Manual has been updated to reflect this update.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 James E. Van Zandt VAMC - Altoona
 North Texas HCS - Dallas
 Manchester VAMC
  
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ---------------------------------------------------- 
 Sites can retrieve the documentation from the following SFTP addresses.
 The preferred method is to SFTP the files from:
   
         download.vista.domain.ext
   
 This will transmit the files from the first available SFTP server.
 Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
 server as follows:
   
         Hines                   sftp.domain.ext
         Salt Lake City          sftp.domain.ext
    
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:  http://www.domain.ext/vdl/

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt.  The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
