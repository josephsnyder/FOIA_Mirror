Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 5.9 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch description is to announce the 
 release of the Enrollment System (ES) 5.9. This release, developed in Java
 technology, contains Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 
 development and upgrade efforts, including enhancements and defect fixes 
 to support Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC), Suicide High Risk
 Patient Enhancements (SHRPE), and ES Sustainment.
  
 ES 5.9 was successfully deployed on Saturday, November 16, 2019.
  
 The following functionality is updated in this ES 5.9 release:
  
 Enrollment System Modernization (ESM)
 1. ES includes a new functionality that enables users to view and upload a
    Veteran's documents in the Enrollment System.
  
    The system provides the Document Management capability setting for a 
    user or role. This setting defines the user's access to the Upload
    Documents panel on the Document Management screen. There are three
    capabilities:
      1. View - ES User (Add to the existing Observer Role)
      2. View and Upload - ES User (Add to the existing Edit Capability 
         Role or Add a Person Role)
         - ES users cannot edit or delete their own comment after it has 
           been added.
         - ES users can add multiple comments to their own record, one 
           comment at a time.
         - ES users can view and upload a document.
      3. View, Upload, and Remove - ES Advanced User
         - ES Advanced Users can go into their own or others' records, 
           back in time, to add a comment.
         - ES Advanced Users can add multiple comments to an existing 
           record.
         - ES Advanced Users can view, upload and remove documents.
  
 2. ES is enhanced to allow entry, editing, and deletion of all associate
    types within Add a Person (AAP) and the Associates tab within the
    Demographics tab. ES is also enhanced to send all associate updates to
    VistA sites.
  
 3. The ADR Adaptor has been enabled to check address matching in ES before
    applying a bad address indicator (BAI) from VA Profile. There are no
    user interface changes associated with this enhancement.
  
    When ES receives a permanent mailing address with a BAI from VA 
    Profile, it compares the received VA Profile permanent mailing address
    to the ES permanent mailing address for that specific Veteran and
    determines if the ES permanent mailing address matches the VA Profile
    permanent mailing address.
      - If Yes, ES sets the Bad Address Reason field to "Undeliverable" on 
        the Addresses screen.
      - If No, no update to the ES permanent mailing address occurs.
  
    When ES receives an update for a permanent mailing address with a blank
    BAI, then ES determines if the VA Profile permanent mailing address is 
    newer than the ES permanent mailing address based on the date/time
    stamp.
       - If the VA Profile permanent mailing address is newer, ES applies 
         the VA Profile permanent mailing address.
       - If the VA Profile permanent mailing address is NOT newer, ES will 
         NOT apply the VA Profile permanent mailing address.
  
    When ES sends a BAI to VA Profile, ES sends the value of "True" instead
    of the Bad Address Reasons value selected by the user. Bad Address
    Reasons include: Homeless, Other, and Undeliverable.
  
 4. ES has added two new Core Veteran Medical Benefit Plans and the 
    necessary rules to support their assignment to specific groups of
    Veterans:
    - VETERAN - FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS TREATMENT & RX COPAY EXEMPT (X)
      (Short Description: FM 6)
    - VETERAN - FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS TREATMENT COPAY EXEMPT & RX COPAY
      REQUIRED (Y) (Short Description: FM RxCo 6)
  
 Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC)
 1. ES has discontinued filtering out deprecated records for the same 
    person when matching records for the qualifications for the Community
    Care Program, so if either one of the duplicate records have qualifying
    criteria in which the Veteran is considered enrolled, then that data 
    can be applied to the surviving record for determining Community Care
    eligibility. Community Care eligibility will be calculated based on
    eligibility factors found on the surviving and deprecated record(s) for
    that Veteran and the eligibility outcome(s) and/or Veteran Medical 
    Benefit Plan(s) are made/stored/displayed/shared in ES, VistA,
    Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Eligibility and Enrollment
    (E&E) web service, and in files to the contractors (i.e., Third-Party
    Administrator (TPA) and CCN).
  
 2. A daily report, specifically for Community Care, is generated out of 
    ES to optimize and expose any potential trouble areas in the extract,
    transform, load (ETL) jobs and specific ES interfaces.  This report is
    created out of Oracle and displayed as part of a daily email sent to an
    authorized ES User Mail Group. The report is generated in the morning
    to include data from the day before.
  
 3. Authorized ES users can manually grant Community Care Urgent Care 
    static eligibility for an enrolled Veteran when approval is received
    from the Office of Community Care so that Veterans' records can reflect
    the accurate eligibility for 2 years. The updated Urgent Care
    eligibility displays on the Overview page, Community Care Determination
    Screen, and on the Community Care Determination History Screen and
    triggers downstream processes to include determining the Veteran
    Medical Benefit Plan (VMBP) and communicating Community Care
    eligibility within VA and with external partners.
  
 Suicide High Risk Patient Enhancements (SHRPE)
 The SHRPE enhancements will identify eligibility for emergency mental 
 health care services for former Service members with other than honorable 
 (OTH) administrative discharge and track their care. The enhancements 
 involve:
  
 1. Addition of a new "Expanded MH Care Non-Enrollee" non-Veteran primary
    eligibility code.
  
 2. Addition of two new eligibility factors to identify the OTH-related 
    mental health care reason.
  
    ES will send the new eligibility code, the OTH eligibility factor and
    other related data to VistA sites using the existing framework (HL7
    messaging).
  
 3. Addition of 90-day tracking cycles, where applicable, in ES.
  
    Former service members with an OTH administrative discharge (who are
    waiting for their additional discharge adjudication to be completed) 
    may receive care for their mental health care emergency needs for an
    initial 90-day period, which can include inpatient, residential, or
    outpatient care. Additional 90-day periods of care may be authorized as
    needed by a Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Chief Medical
    Officer.
  
 Operational Decision Management (ODM) 
 Under ODM, the 71 iLOG rule sets were transferred from iLOG to ODM. A
 Mediation Framework was established to allow the system administrators to
 switch between the iLOG and ODM rules sets as the rules sets are
 integrated into the ES application. Once the migration is fully completed
 to ODM, the rules will not be switched back to iLOG unless there is a
 systemic issue with ODM. ES 5.9 supports integration of the Dependent 
 Validation, Spouse Validation, Link Person Registry, and Military Service 
 Validation rule sets.

 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
  
 1015762     Problem: Error reports are detected when trying to display the
             Community Care Determination screen.
             Resolution: The code was looking for old data, which, if 
             found, would prevent display of the screen. References to the
             old data in the code have been removed.
  
 1069933     Problem: A residential address change was not triggering the
             necessary VCE recalculation.
             Resolution: A back-end change in Production was made to 
             resolve the issue.
  
 1108368     Problem: If the Veteran is not enrolled then Pending; 
             Eligibility Unverified, Pending; Means Test Required (No Prior
             Enrollment), the Community Care outcome should be Ineligible.
             Resolution: A Veteran with no prior period of enrollment is
             assigned a VCE of ineligible even if there is no existing VCE.
  
 1111363     Problem: A null date of birth (DOB) and incorrect format for 
             date of death (DOD) is being sent to Optum.
             Resolution: Updated code to use date_of_birth_txt (string) and
             not date_of_birth (date); updated DOD format when date is
             imprecise.
  
 1114232     Problem: Community Care Network (CCN) file contains deceased 
             and not enrolled records.
             Resolution: If the Veteran is not enrolled or is now 
             ineligible, the record is checked to determine whether the
             record was ever sent to CCN contractors. If it was, a status
             of ineligible will be sent.
  
 1119805     Problem: Residential addresses with state code "CA" are not
             flagged for geocoding.
             Resolution: "CA" was being filtered out from geocodable 
             states; updated code to include "CA" in states that can be
             geocoded.
  
 1119845     Problem: Residential address changes made for not-enrolled
             status are excluded from geocoding as per design. However, 
             when the Veteran's enrollment changes to enrolled, the address
             in geocoding transmit is out of sync with the residential
             address. For enrolled Veterans, if the geocoding transmit is
             out of sync with the residential address, the residential
             address should be flagged for geocoding.
             Resolution: The VCE recalculation is modified so that when an
             enrolled Veteran is being calculated, if the geocoding 
             transmit address is not in sync with the residential address,
             the residential address is flagged for geocoding. If the
             address line 1, city, state, and zip code are not the same,
             the address is considered to be out of sync.
  
 1122348     Problem: CCN seeding file contains deceased and not enrolled
             records. The initial file should exclude deprecated persons.
             Resolution: Updated database to exclude deprecated persons.
  
 1122672     Problem: Veterans residing in Philippine Islands should 
             qualify for N VCE. The residential address could have a
             country code of "PHL" or a state code of "PH" or "PI". All
             such addresses qualify for N VCE.
             Resolution: Updated code to allow PI state to be in N state 
             when VCE parameter for N State is PH. This will make records
             with PI state code eligible for N VCE.
  
 1132140     Problem: If state code is PH the ES to PSSG ETL will filter 
             out and not send to PSSG for geocoding.
             Resolution: ES to PSSG and ES to PSSG monthly ETL code is
             modified to not exclude the PH state code from states that 
             can be geocoded.
  
 1138817     Problem: ES is not able to receive Other Health Insurance 
             (OHI) data if there is no insurance company fax number.
             Resolution: Added a null and blank check for carrier phone and
             fax so that an individual record exception can be caught and
             logged and then other records can be processed.
