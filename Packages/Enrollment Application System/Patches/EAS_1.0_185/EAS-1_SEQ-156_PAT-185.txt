 --------    ---------------------
 951062      Problem: Section 508: Some active controls that generate an 
             error are neither read with error nor marked as error
             (Completed Reports/Report Filter, "Date Run To:" field). Due
             to this, ES users requiring assistive technology may not be
             made aware of errors on a screen.
  
             Resolution: A new label property and report action constant 
             was created and the "Date Run To" label is individually marked
             when the date contains an error.
  
 1085386     Problem: When the Timeout modal is created, other content in 
             the application is rendered inactive with the mouse. However,
             content remains active with the keyboard. This does not allow
             the structure (a modal window) to be understood as conveyed
             through presentation.
  
             Resolution: Programmed the application to loop only through 
             the two modal buttons when the modal appears.
  
 1085410     Problem: Section 508: The Birth Sex radio group name is read
             after the label of each radio button.
  
             Resolution: Removed framework tags from the birthsex.html 
             radio buttons.
  
 1129844     Problem: Cerner Notification: Insurance information is not
             reflected in the ES user interface when an incoming message
             includes a Spinal Cord Injury object.
  
             Resolution: Existing code was removed and then added the 
             Spinal Cord Injury object; fixed code to update the existing
             Spinal Cord Injury object instead.
  
 1154606     Problem: ESCC Quality Report Urgent Care section shows 
             incorrect count of records with "U".
  
             Resolution: Urgent care quality count has been fixed.
  
 1156756     Problem: Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 2019 annual service
             updates need to be implemented.
  
             Resolution: Updated service stub and relative bean 
             configuration for 2019 IRS annual update.
  
 1158546     Problem: Cerner Notification: Medicaid Indicator does not 
             update from True to False when the update comes from Cerner.
  
             Resolution: Updated the code mapping to use
             "medicaidLastModifiedDate" for Cerner inbound flow.
  
 1159297     Problem: ESCC Quality Report Urgent Care Section - count of
             records with "U" should check on the record created date.
  
             Resolution: Updated Urgent Care section so that "Count of 
             records with U" checks on the record created date instead of
             the record modified date.
  
 1161409     Problem: ESCC Quality Report "Unchanged Address" column needs
             clarification.
  
             Resolution: The second asterisk is changed to "**" and refers 
             to "Record Count of Unchanged Addresses": "** Changed address
             can be a change to Line 1, city, state or zip as compared to
             geocode_transmit Line 1, city, state or zip".
  
 1164218     Problem: ESCC Quality Report VCE count for "Not Determined" 
             (ND) VCE ignores ND VCE with modified date June 7, 2019.
  
             Resolution: Updated ND VCE count to ignore VCE created on or
             before June 6, 2019.
  
 1164305     Problem: The batch job to recalculate VMBP needs to process a
             maximum of 7,000 per run.
  
             Resolution: Modified the boundary restriction on the batch 
             job to a limit of 7,000.
  
 1164424     Problem: Two new document types need to be added: Enrollment
             Application and Administration.
  
             Resolution: Inserted rows into the lookup type and updated
             JavaScript filter for the new document types and names map.
  
 1167260     Problem: VCE recalculation exception should not reset the
             recalculation flag to "N".
  
             Resolution: Updated code so that the VCE recalculation error 
             now only resets the flag to "N" after 24 hours post-VCE record
             modified date.
  
 1167331     Problem: Administrative Data Repository (ADR) stored procedure
             for ESCC Quality Third-Party Administrator (TPA)/Community 
             Care Network (CCN) counts should use the current date as the
             process date.
  
             Resolution: Updated ADR stored procedure code to use the 
             current date.
  
 1168309     Problem: ESCC Quality Report VCE count shows incorrectly
             according to the date.
  
             Resolution: Updated code to swap VCE counts for the days and
             added a numeric check to the code string.
  
 1171394     Problem: Other Health Insurance (OHI) report errors out due to
             missing expiration date.
  
             Resolution: Added null checks for OHI expiration date and
             effective date.
