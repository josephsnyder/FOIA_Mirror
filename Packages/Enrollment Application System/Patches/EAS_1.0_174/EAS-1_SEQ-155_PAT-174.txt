Description:
============

 Patch EAS*1.0*174 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 EAS*1.0*174 is also being released in support of the Enrollment System 
 (ES) 5.6 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1*178 (Enrollment 
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 IMPORTANT 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following patches, which all include functionality for Medal of 
 Honor, will be released concurrently and should be installed in the
 following order:
  
 1. Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture 
    (VistA) Registration, Eligibility, & Enrollment (REE) Registration (DG)
    patch DG*5.3*972, released with Income Verification Match (IVM) patch
    IVM*2.0*183 in Host File DG_53_P972.KID, ensures Veterans awarded 
    Medal of Honor are placed in Priority Group 1 and are exempt from
    copayments for health care and medications.
  
 2. Patch IVM*2.0*183, released with DG*5.3*972 in Host File 
    DG_53_P972.KID, modifies how VistA determines if an income test is the
    active current test per Veteran's Financial Assessment (VFA) rules and
    adds a condition that Medal of Honor recipients are not subject to
    income testing.
  
 3. Patch EAS*1.0*174 ensures VistA users can exempt Veterans awarded 
    Medal of Honor from Long Term Care (LTC) copayments and LTC income
    testing.
  
 4. Integrated Billing (IB) patch IB*2.0*627 will need to be installed
    directly after EAS*1.0*174 as the full functionality of Medal of Honor
    will not be apparent until IB*2.0*627 is installed.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Currently the Add A New LTC Copayment Test [EASEC LTC COPAY TEST ADD] 
 option determines if a Veteran qualifies for an automatic LTC Copay Test 
 exemption without consideration of the Veteran's Medal of Honor status.  
 If the Veteran does not qualify for an automatic exemption, the user can 
 manually select from a sub-set of the LTC Copay Test exemption reasons, 
 and the user can also complete the detailed income test (LTC Copayment 
 Exemption Test). 
  
 Public Law 114-315 amends United States Code Title 38 Section 1710(a),
 1710B, and 1722A and exempts Veterans awarded Medal of Honor from
 copayments for health care, medications, and extended care services.
  
 Additionally, PL 114-315 provides that all Veterans awarded the Medal of
 Honor currently enrolled for VA hospital care and medical services, and
 whose Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enrollment records are not
 currently assigned to Priority Group 1, will have their enrollment record
 updated to reflect enrollment in Priority Group 1 and exemption from
 copayments for health care, medications, and extended care services.
  
 EAS*1.0*174 ensures VistA users can exempt Veterans awarded Metal of Honor
 from Long Term Care (LTC) copayments and LTC income testing.
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
 This patch includes the following enhancements to VistA REE:
  
 1. VistA is updated to add a new LTC reason for exemption entry "VETERAN
    AWARDED MEDAL OF HONOR" in the LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION file (#714.1). 
  
  
    BEGIN SCREEN CAPTURE #1
  
    Output from what File: LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION//   (14 entries)
    LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION List                APR 04, 2019@08:27  PAGE 1

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    NAME: VETERAN AWARDED MEDAL OF HONOR   14      YES
  
    END SCREEN CAPTURE #1
  
  
 2. When a VistA REE user selects the Add A New LTC Copayment Test
    [EASEC LTC COPAY TEST ADD] option, VistA first determines if the 
    Veteran qualifies for an automatic exemption. The automatic exemption 
    logic now also considers whether the Veteran is awarded Medal of Honor.
  
    a. Medal of Honor is inserted into the hierarchy of automatic 
       exemptions in the following order:
  
       Number  Name
       1       COMPENSABLE SC DISABILITY
       14      VETERAN AWARDED MEDAL OF HONOR
       10      INCOME (LAST YEAR) BELOW LTC THRESHOLD
       12      INCOME (CURRENT YEAR) BELOW LTC THRESHOLD
  
    b. VistA automatically selects the new MOH LTC reason for exemption
       that is highest in the hierarchy, so a Veteran that is awarded
       Medal of Honor and has an eligibility of Compensable Service 
       Connected will be assigned the LTC reason for exemption
       "COMPENSABLE SC DISABILITY.
  
    c. When the CURRENT MOH INDICATOR field (#.541) in the PATIENT file 
       (#2) is YES and the Veteran is not SC Compensable, the new Medal
       of Honor LTC reason for exemption is assigned.
  
  
      BEGIN SCREEN CAPTURE #2

      =======================================================================
  
      END SCREEN CAPTURE #2
  
  
 3. When the Veteran does not have an eligibility or income that qualifies
    for automatic exemption from LTC copayments and income testing, the Add
    a New LTC Copayment Test [EASEC LTC COPAY TEST ADD] option
    functionality is unchanged. When the system prompts for the "Reason  
    for Exemption:", the user may enter "??" to view the user-selectable
    reasons for exemption. None of the automatically selectable reasons,
    including "VETERAN AWARDED MEDAL OF HONOR" will be displayed or  
    selectable.

 4. When a user selects Edit an Existing LTC Copayment Test [EASEC 
    LTC COPAY TEST EDIT] option for a Veteran that is awarded Medal of
    Honor and has an existing LTC copayment test, the user will not be 
    able to edit the test.

       will display.

 Patch Installation:
 -------------------
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 See the IMPORTANT note in the Description section - full functionality of 
 Medal of Honor will not be apparent until Host File DG_53_P972.KID
 (DG*5.3*972 and IVM*2.0*183), patch EAS*1.0*174, and patch IB*2.0*627 are 
 all installed.
  
 An environment check routine is included in the build. This routine 
 checks the LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION file (#714.1) and confirms the file 
 contains the expected # of records before the EAS*1.0*174 patch is
 installed. If the environment check fails when the build is loaded for
 installation the following message is displayed:
 "It looks like you don't have the right entries in LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION 
 file (#714.1) installed. Please enter a YOUR IT Services ticket with the
 Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) for assistance with getting "the correct
 number of entries into the LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION file (#714.1)."
 If the message is displayed then a YOUR IT Services ticket with the 
 Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) will need to be entered for assistance with 
 getting the correct number of entries into the LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION file 
 (#714.1). 
  
 The environment check routine EAS1174E will be automatically deleted upon
 installation of this patch.

 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service 
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 Any issues would need to be evaluated to determine if: a back-out of the 
 software is appropriate; a new patch is needed; or if data requires 
 correction or restoration.
   
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a
 backup of other VistA software components, such as DD, cross-reference,
 and template changes.
