 KNOWN ISSUES:
 =============
  
 Issue #1:  SAC Violation
  
 XT*7.3*110 released October 22, 2008, made changes to the routine XINDEX to
 comply with the latest revision of the SAC standards.  That document can be
 viewed at the following link:
  
 http://vista.med.va.gov/sacc/docs/SACC_2008.pdf
  
 The EVC R2 project was to be released to the field October 18, 2008; however,
 due to necessary delays in the parent project (ESR 3.0), this release was
 delayed.  Product Support conducted a review the EVC R2 project in November
 2008 which resulted in the newly revised version of XINDEX reporting
 violations of the current SAC standard in certain routines associated with
 this project.  Each instance resulted in the "Lock missing Timeout" error
 being reported.  As the EVC R2 project did not create or modify the locks
 where the violations are reported, a waiver was sought from the SAC committee.
 The SAC committee recognized:  (1) the issue with the locks was not detected
 due to circumstances beyond the control of the EVC R2 project team, and (2)
 the code has been in production for several years.   While the SAC committee
 supported the EVC R2 request for the management waiver, as a technical body it
 was unable to grant a technical exemption / waiver for the standard.  The
 decision to release rather than to remediate was an approved Management
 Decision supported by the SAC committee.  Remedy Ticket # 305037 was logged
 and referred to the maintenance development team requesting remediation of the
 SAC violations.

 *****************************************************************************
  
 The Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) project is being undertaken to support
 technology and business changes that are occurring with the implementation
 of the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) Enrollment System Redesign (ESR)
 project.  Some modified and new business functionality is being included in
 the new system, and corresponding changes are necessary in VistA for
 preliminary determination of the veteran's Enrollment and Eligibility status.
 The EVC project will be released in two phases.  This release represents EVC
 Release 2.
  
 This patch is being released along with DG*5.3*688 (Registration), and
 IVM*2*115 (Income Verification Match) in host file: DG_53_P688.KID
  
 Please refer to the patch description for DG*5.3*688 for complete details.
  
   
 Features of this project are as follows:
  
 1.  Address Sharing Functionality
  
 - The following functionality has been modified to support foreign address:
     View Patient Address                      [EAS VIEW PATIENT ADDRESS]
     Zero Day Letters Print                    [EAS MT 0 DAY LETTER PRINT]
     Thirty Day Letters Print                  [EAS MT 30 DAY LETTER PRINT]
     Sixty Day Letters Print                   [EAS MT 60 DAY LETTER PRINT]
  
 2.  Modify online 10-10EZ filing process for new address fields
  
 - With the implementation of EVC, VistA will now require a country to be
 entered for the permanent address.  To enable the online 10-10EZ process 
 to comply with this requirement, the EAS Data Filing system was modified
 to auto-populate the field 'APPLICANT COUNTRY' with 'UNITED STATES'.
  
 3.  Modify 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR printing routines to support foreign 
 address
  
 - The 10-10EZ/EZR printing routines were modified to support the printing 
 of the following new fields added to the Patient file (#2) for foreign
 addresses:
     PROVINCE    (#.1171)
     POSTAL CODE (#.1172)
     COUNTRY     (#.1173)
  
 4. Modify 10-10EZ processing to align with the Feb 2005 10-10EZ 
 Application for Health Benefits Form
  
 - With the implementation of EVC, on-line means test data collection will 
 be aligned with the format of the Feb 2005 10-10EZ Application for Health
 Benefits Form.  The following modifications were made to the EAS Data
 Comparison screens to be consistent with the new format:
    Old                                     New
    ---                                     ---
    Gross Annual Income                     Employment Income
    Gross Medical Expenses                  Non-Reimbursed Medical Expenses
    Real Property                           Land/Bldgs
  
 5. Modify 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR printing routines for the new format
  
 - Modifications were made to the 10-10EZ/EZR printing routines to support 
 the implementation of the Feb 2005 10-10EZ Application for Health Benefits
 format.
  
 6. Modify Long Term Care Copay Exemption Test
  
 - Modifications were made to the LTC Copay Exemption Test input and 
 display processes to support the Feb 2005 10-10EZ Application for Health
 Benefits Form.
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy tickets:
 ==================================================
 HD0000000141306
  
   Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
   -----------------------------
   HD0000000141306
  
   Problem:   The dependent child information was not printing on the 10-10EZ.
  
   Solution:  The I408^EASEZPVI api was not returning dependent child
              information if the INCOME AVAILABLE TO YOU field (#.12) in the
              INCOME RELATION file (#408.22) was not 'Yes'.  Changes have
              been made to the I408^EASEZPVI api to remove this check and
              always return dependent child's information regardless.
