Subject: FIX BAD GMT MSA CODE X-REF

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 NOTE:
 The issue described below was corrected with the release of patch
 EAS*1.0*89, 2009 GMT THRESHOLDS, released 12/24/2008. Patch EAS*1*87 
 was delayed and as a result was made redundant by the release and
 installation of patch 89. EAS*1*89 does not address this issue in its
 description. Accordingly, EAS*1*87 is being released as an informational
 patch to provide the necessary Remedy ticket and other documentation
 follow-up. There is no code component associated with this patch.
 ________________________________________________________________________
  
 This patch, EAS*1.0*87, addresses an erroneous cross-reference ("AMSA") 
 in the GMT MSA CODE file (#712.6), which is due to an incorrect data 
 value in the MSA CODE field (#1) of the GMT MSA CODE file (#712.6). For 
 zip code 02532 the data value in both the MSA CODE field (#1) and AMSA 
 cross-reference is currently 1120. Instead, the data value in the field
 and cross-reference should be 740.  
  
 Due to the erroneous cross-reference, when a lookup is performed on the
 02532 zip code resulting from execution of the option GMT Thresholds
 Lookup by Zip Code (EAS GMT THRESHOLDS LOOKUP), the user will receive a
 message stating that the GMT Threshold is not available. The purpose of
 this patch is to correct the cross-reference (by correcting the field 
 value) so that the GMT thresholds will be properly displayed whenever the
 user selects the option GMT Thresholds Lookup by Zip Code (EAS GMT
 THRESHOLDS LOOKUP).

 HD0000000123987 - GMT Threshold is not avail
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000123987 - GMT Threshold is not avail
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the zip code 02532 is selected as input to the option GMT Thresholds
 Lookup by Zip Code (THRESHOLDS LOOKUP BY ZIP CODE), a message displays to 
 the screen, stating that the GMT Threshold is not available. This is
 caused by an incorrect data value in the MSA CODE field (#1) of the GMT
 MSA CODE file (#712.6).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Zip Code 02532 previously had an incorrect data value of 1120 in the MSA 
 CODE field (#1) of the GMT MSA CODE file (#712.6). It was correctly 
 updated to a data value of 740 with the release of patch EAS*1*89.
