Subject: IVM MEANS TEST UPLOAD ISSUES CORRECTED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects a problem that is causing veterans' financial (Means 
 and Rx Co-pay) Tests to be incorrectly paired, or "linked" together in
 VistA when the dates of the two tests are not in the same year. This
 problem occurs when an IVM-converted Means or Rx Co-pay Test is being
 uploaded into the database. If the veteran's most recent existing test of
 the same type as the incoming test has been linked to another test, this
 link will be added to the incoming test even if the date of the linked
 test is in a different year. This makes the link invalid, because the two
 tests are not in the same year.
  
 This patch will be distributed in a Host File along with patch DG*5.3*661 
 (Fix Invalid Copay Links - Non IVM Tests). Patch DG*5.3*661 corrects this
 same problem for non-IVM-converted tests.  NOTE: The DG patch includes a
 post-installation 'clean up' routine that will delete existing links
 between all Means Test/Rx Co-pay Test pairs in the database, both IVM- and
 non-IVM Converted, whose dates are not in the same year.

 Problem:
 --------
 The problem described above is exemplified by the incorrect linking of an 
 existing Rx Co-pay Test from a previous year to a new IVM-converted Means
 Test being uploaded from an HL7 Z06 message. The fact that the co-pay test
 is for a previous year makes it appear that the co-pay exemption status
 for the current year is not based on the income or patient eligibility
 factors for that year.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 When an incoming, IVM-converted test is uploaded, the code will check the
 veteran's most recent existing test of the same type. If it has a link,
 the code will add that link to the new test, but only if the dates of the
 new test, existing test, and linked test are all in the same year.
