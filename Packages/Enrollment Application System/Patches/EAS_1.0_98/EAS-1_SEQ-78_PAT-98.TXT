Subject: 2010 GMT THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Per forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2009-### (# to be assigned upon publication)
 - This patch MUST be installed before January 1, 2010. The patch is being
 released as an Emergency patch together with DG*5.3*818 (2010 Means Test
 Thresholds) and IB*2.0*425 (2010 RX Copay Thresholds) and may be installed
 out of sequence with respect to other released Enrollment Application 
 System (EAS) patches.
  
 Please Note:  We expect the VHA Directive to be titled MEANS TEST AND 
 GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2010. In order 
 to provide adequate time for sites to install, Central Business Office 
 has agreed that these patches may be released prior to availability of 
 the actual Directive Number.
  
 The Geographic-Based Means Test Thresholds for Calendar Year 2010 provided
 in forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2009-###, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED
 MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2010 are distributed with this
 patch. The updated values for the GMT THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) are used in
 the determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year,
 based on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development. This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic based 
 income limits for Income Year (IY) 2009 can be found January 1, 2010 at:
 http://www.va.gov/healtheligibility/Library/pubs/GMTIncomeThresholds/
  
 This patch, EAS*1.0*98, is one of three VistA 2010 Threshold patches. It 
 addresses the annual updates for the GMT Thresholds. Patch DG*5.3*818 
 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual 
 Pension Rate. Patch IB*2.0*425 will address the annual updates for the 
 Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.
  
 Please Note:  This year, only the GMT Threshold dollar amounts will be 
 increasing from a year ago. All other dollar amounts and rates will 
 remain the same as the corresponding figures from last year. Patches for 
 the Registration and Integrated Billing packages are still needed in 
 order to link the figures to Calendar Year 2010/Income Year 2009.
