Description:
============

 Issue 1:
  
 With the release of patch EAS*1.0*81, the Electronic 10-10EZ Processing 
 [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING] option has been compromised and does not file
 patient data for patients new to the local VistA site in the usual way.
 Some users have reported that 1) when they attempt to link the new patient
 to the PATIENT File (#2) (by means of protocol action Link to Patient File
 [EAS EZ LINK TO FILE 2]), they are unable to continue unless they repeat
 the linking action. Other users have reported that 2) when they print VA
 FORM 10-10EZ, the fields that normally display data received via the
 web-based commercial 1010EZ application are blank, even though in VistA,
 the users' 10-10EZ screens display the data; or 3) when the users go into
 the Registration menu to view the newly-linked patient, only Name and a
 few other fields display data. "Address" and the other fields do not get
 populated, even though the users had previously accepted them. Thus, they 
 find they must enter the data manually.
  
 Routine EASEZI has been modified to correct these problems. With the
 changes, data associated with 10-10EZ patients new to VistA will file
 properly into the PATIENT File (#2) and display appropriately when users
 utilize Registration menu options or print VA FORM 10-10EZ.

 HD0000000363790     Problems since loading EAS*1*81  (original)
  
 When using the New Processing List for the 1010EZ on brand new
 patients to the Vista System, and attempting to link the patient to the 
 PATIENT (#2) file, the code gets into a loop and users have to uparrow to
 exit out. Applications in which the patients are already in their database
 become inactivated. If you look in File #2, the only information that is
 there is the Name, DOB and SSN. The address and other information does not
 get populated, even though fields have been accepted. It looks like by
 accepting the fields after doing the Link to Patient file twice,
 everything is there.
   
  
 Duplicates:
 HD0000000369467     Unable to print out 1010s
 Reported that the problem occurs on brand new to the Vista System
 patients. They inactivate applications in which the patient is already
 in their database. If you look in File #2, the only information that is
 there is the Name, DOB and SSN. The address and other information
 does not get populated, even though they accept the fields. 
  
  
 HD0000000364159     10-10 EZ Application Printing
 The 1010EZ showed on the screen, but when it was printed the fields
 were missing.  Also in File #2 the address was missing, but there was
 Name, DOB, SSN and SC and ICN. Minimum patient info in File #2.
 Problem was reported... "immediately after installing patch EAS*1*81."
  
 HD0000000363854     patch 1*81
 Information for the new 1010EZ displays on screen, but does not print on
 printer. If you view registration, all that is there is the Name, DOB, SSN
 and gender. The address is missing.
  
 HD0000000363806      EAS*1*81 Issue with printing
 Since installation of patch EAS*1*81, sites are unable to print the 10-10
 containing data received via the web application. The data does show
 on screen and the fields are populated but when the 10-10 is printed
 the fields are blank.
  
 HD0000000363791     After installation of EAS*1*81 all information
                        does not upload to the registration package
  
 In the past when we processed on-line applications, all the information
 would feed into the registration package. Now, we follow the same process,
 but only the Name, SSN, and DOB feed in. We are able to print the on-liner
 and then add the information manually, but this is time consuming and it
 does not seem like it should work that way. The option we use is 
 ^EZ Electronic 10-10EZ Processing. Within that option we then use the 
 following options to load the Veteran:  Link to Patient file (LZ), accept
 all (AZ), print 101/0 (PZ). At this point, we send (mail) to Veteran for
 signature. Once returned, we go back into ^EZ and use the Verify
 Signature option (VZ). It used to be once we linked and accepted, all
 info fed into the registration package in VISTA.  Now it does not.
  
  
 HD0000000373362 -  Problem with online application.  Brand new patients 
 to the Vista system inactivate applications in which the patient is already
 in their database.  The address and other information does not get
 populated, even though they accept the fields.  
  
 HD0000000404678- Form 1010EZ is missing data when patient
 enters info in the form online. Patient data for new patients does
 not print address and other information on the 1010EZ forms.

 Issue 2:
 --------
  
 With the release of patch DG*5.3*688, the functionality of auto-
 calculating the annual value when the user appends an asterisk to the
 monthly value of a particular field (which gets entered into the All OTHER
 INCOME field (#.17) of File INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME (#408.21)) has been
 removed. "All Other Income" is the only field that was affected in LTC
 Copayments Menu [EASEC LTC COPAY MENU], Edit an Existing../Add a New LTC
 Copayment Test [EASEC LTC COPAY TEST EDIT/..ADD], Current Calendar Year
 Gross Income Screen <5>. As intended, the other two fields on this screen
 can still calculate the annual amount, as can all ten fields on the
 Deductible Expenses Screen <6>.
  
 Due to patch DG*5.3*688, the user can no longer append an asterisk after 
 the value s/he enters for "All Other Income" when following the menu path 
 above. However, the last line of the Help Text for this field, which is 
 generic and partially copied from other dollar value fields, still states
 'A monthly amount can be entered with an '*' after it.' Thus if the user
 questions the "All Other Income" prompt, s/he will see a message whose 
 last line is inappropriate. This patch will remove that statement from the
 Help Text.
  
 The input transform for the ALL OTHER INCOME field (#.17) of File
 INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME (#408.21) evaluates the type of test the data is
 being stored for, thus crossing into two separate packages, REGISTRATION
 (DG) and ENROLLMENT APPLICATION SYSTEM (EAS). Routines DGMTDD4 and EASECDD
 have been edited to prevent the inappropriate Help Text statement from
 displaying. This patch contains the edit for routine EASECCD, and patch
 DG*5.3*812 includes the edit for routine DGMTDD4. These two patches can be
 installed independently from one other; different orders of installation
 will not compromise the functionality of the input transform.
  
 Remedy ticket and CR:
 --------------------
  
 HD0000000315498 and CCR9603
  
 The Calendar Year Gross Income Screen (5) does not calculate the annual
 amount from the monthly amount when an asterisk is appended to the value
 of the All Other Income field that is stored in field #.17 of file
 INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME (#408.21).  
  
  
 Duplicates:
 -----------
  
 HD0000000341958 - Same as remedy 315498.   The Calendar
 Year Gross Income Screen(5) does not calculate the annual
 amount when the monthly amount with an asterisk appended
 is entered in the Other Income field.
  
 HD0000000376853 -  Entering monthly amounts * 12 fails to annualize.
 Entering the asterisk no longer works on menu option 
 "Edit an Existing LTC Copayment Test".
  
 Issue 3
 -------
  
 When a new web-based 1010EZ files data for a Stepson or Stepdaughter,
 the relation is filed incorrectly. Both file with a relation of OTHER.
 Stepson should file as Stepson and Stepdaughter should file as
 stepdaughter. Routine EASEZF3 has been modified to fix this problem. With
 the changes, each relation will file correctly.
  
 HD0000000383126 Dependent Relationship Filing Incorrectly.
 Stepson and stepdaughter file incorrectly when filing a web-based 
 1010EZ. They file with a dependent relation of OTHER.
