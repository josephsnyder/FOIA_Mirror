 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000274174 - EASEC LTC COPAY PRINT output incorrect
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Calculated LTC Copayments Print [EASEC LTC COPAY PRINT] report option,
 can in certain circumstances provide estimates different from what the
 actual billing option LTC Billing Clock Inquiry [IBAEC LTC CLOCK INQUIRY]
 generates.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 This report is only intended to be a projected estimate, so a disclaimer 
 message has been added to advise the user that this report provides only
 projected estimates dependent upon existing conditions. Also a similar
 disclaimer that the following report contains only projected estimates
 based on existing data was added to the report header.
  
 The wording of the two disclaimers:
  
 ** This report is intended to provide a projected estimate of charges that
 should generate for a patient admitted for a LTC stay. These estimates are
 dependent on existing conditions with the projected estimate out to a 
 year being presented in the report. Be advised that changing circumstances
 or  newer LTC Copay tests within this timeframe could impact these
 projected estimates and a discrepancy can exist from the actual charges
 billing generates. **
  
 and
  
 **This report contains projected estimates based on existing data**
