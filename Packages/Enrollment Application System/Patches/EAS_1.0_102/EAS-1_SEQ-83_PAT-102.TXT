Subject: 2011 GMT THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Per forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-### - This patch MUST be installed
 before January 1, 2011. The patch is being released as an Emergency patch
 together with DG*5.3*833 (2011 Means Test Thresholds) and IB*2.0*441 (2011
 RX Copay Thresholds) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to
 other released EAS patches.
  
 Please Note:  We expect the VHA Directive to be titled MEANS TEST AND 
 GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2011. In order 
 to provide adequate time for sites to install, Central Business Office 
 has agreed that these patches may be released prior to availability of 
 the actual Directive Number.
  
 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for Calendar Year 2011 provided
 in forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2010-###, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED
 MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2011 are distributed with this
 patch. The updated values for the GMT THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) are used in
 the determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year,
 based on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development. This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic based 
 income limits for Income Year (IY) 2010 can be found January 1, 2011 at:
 http://www4.va.gov/healtheligibility/Library/AnnualThresholds.asp
  
 This patch, EAS*1.0*102 is one of three VistA 2011 threshold patches.  
 It addresses the annual updates for the GMT Thresholds. Patch DG*5.3*833
 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual 
 Pension Rate. Patch IB*2.0*441 will address the annual updates for the 
 Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.
