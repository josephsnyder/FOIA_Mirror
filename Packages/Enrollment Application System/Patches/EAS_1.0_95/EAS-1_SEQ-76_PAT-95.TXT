Subject: LLESROUT VIE Port Change

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch, EAS*1.0*95, is being released in conjunction with planned 
 configuration changes to each facilities' local BusinessWare server (VIE).  
 The configuration changes involved are a change to the port utilized by HL7
 logical link, LLESROUT.  The LLESROUT link, introduced by patch EAS*1*71, 
 uses port 8090 to communicate with the facility's Vitria server.  Due to a 
 large volume of HL7 traffic associated with the Enrollment System Redesign 
 (ESR), the contention for port 8090 on the local Vitria servers has become 
 problematic for other applications which utilize and depend on port 8090 
 for communication. The new port available on the local VIE server for 
 exclusive ESR usage is port 8911. Instructions are provided below in the 
 Action(s) Required section on how to effect the configuration change.
  
 It is anticipated that this emergency patch will be released on Wednesday,
 April 22, 2009. Sites can immediately perform the following actions but if
 support issues or questions arise they are welcome to take advantage of
 telephone bridge support from 8am (Eastern) to 5pm (Eastern) on April 22,
 2009 (Wednesday) and April 23, 2009 (Thursday).
  
 The support phone bridge number is:
  
    (800) 767-1750   
  
 which is the VANTS conference bridge.  The code that must be entered is: 
  
 85610
  
 followed by the # key to connect to this call.
  
  
 ** Action(s) Required:
 ======================
  
 Action # 1 - Stop the LLESROUT link using the Start/Stop Links [HL START]
