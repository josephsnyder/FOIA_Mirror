============

 Description:
  
 This informational patch, PRPF*4*1, describes the purpose and contents 
 of VPFS maintenance package VPFS-PKG-1.1.1.6.zip.
  
 Contained within the VPFS-PKG-1.1.1.6.zip package are two components, the
 VPFS application ear file (VPFS-app-1.1.1.003.ear) and VPFS database 
 patch (VPFS-db-patch-1.0.5.001.zip), that provide fixes for 8 Remedy 
 tickets described below.  Seven of these fixes were made in the Java 
 application and one fix, Remedy ticket 226019, was made to a stored 
 procedure in the VPFS database patch.
  
 More information related to the application and database patches, 
 including specific installation instructions, are described in their 
 respective readme and release notes files.
  
 The Remedy tickets being fixed in this package are:
  
 207329  Fixed printing patient cards.
  
 222272  Fiscal transaction summary report is modified so that it picks up 
 the transactions for the last day also.
  
 222278  "Transaction Date" field is added to the Fiscal transaction 
 summary report.
  
 227224  Daily listing and Fiscal transaction summary reports will display 
 the transactions based on the station/division selected.
  
 230728  Modified the GUI screen to fix the "Change Institution" button.
  
 237753  Printing the patient cards for the entire portfolio on each 
 individual page.
  
 238988  Sorting the transactions of the patient on the Patient account 
 card.
  
 226019  Database exception error
  
 Note:  There are also sixteen 508 Compliance fixes that were completed 
 and tested in a previous VPFS version, but were never installed in 
 production prior to the HealtheVet Maintenance Team being awarded the 
 maintenance product work statement (PWS). They are included in this 
 package. All of these 508 compliance fixes have been reviewed by Ellen 
 Crowe McMahon and meet the 508 checklist for web-based internet 
 applications.
  
 Since this HealtheVet application is a centralized application and there 
 are no changes to VistA patches, it is important to note that NO software
 will need to be installed at VistA facilities.
