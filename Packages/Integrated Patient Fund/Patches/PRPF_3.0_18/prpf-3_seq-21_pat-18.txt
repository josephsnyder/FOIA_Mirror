 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ===============
  
 1. HD189149  Patient Funds menu option Guardian Edit not finding patient
  
    Problem:
    -------
    The Patient Funds Guardian Edit [PRPF GUARDIAN EDIT] menu option
    can not find newly registered patients in the VPFS application so
    guardian information can be added to patient data.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    Routine PRPFED2 has been modified to point to the PATIENT (#2) file
    instead of the PATIENT FUNDS (#470) file that is not a valid file after
    the VPFS migration takes place.
