 **************************************************************************
  
 RELEASE INFORMATION:
 ===================
 The release of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) System (TBI) Build 2.0.2
 incorporates the required TBI*2.0*4 upgrades to the TBI application:
  
  
         Issue 1:  Log what is sent to MDWS 
 There is no way to troubleshoot MDWS issues when sending TBI notes back 
 to VistA CPRS.
 Solution 1:  
 The application maintains a MDWS log for all requests to VistA, with the 
 following information:
        date/time stamp of each outgoing transaction
        a copy of the function being sent  to VistA
        a copy of the data arguments being sent  to Vist
        The log files will be retained for 30 days online.
  
  
         Issue 2:  Log what MDWS returns 
 There is no way to troubleshoot what MDWS returns from a call to VistA 
 CPRS.
 Solution 2:
 The application maintains a log file and maintains the following 
 information:
        date/time stamp of each incoming transaction
        a copy of the data being returned to the Registry.
        The log files will be retained for 30 days online.
  
  
         Issue 3:  MPAI Instrument
 The Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI) was designed: 
        to assist in the clinical evaluation of people during the 
 postacute (posthospital) period following acquired brain injury (ABI), 
        to assist in the evaluation of rehabilitation programs designed 
 to serve these people, and 
        to better understand the long-term outcomes of acquired brain 
 injury (ABI). 
 Evaluation and rating of each of the areas designated by MPAI-4 items 
 assures that the most frequent and important sequelae of ABI are 
 considered for rehabilitation planning or other clinical interventions. 
 MPAI-4 items represent the range of physical, cognitive, emotional, 
 behavioral, and social problems that people may encounter after ABI. 
 MPAI-4 items also provide an assessment of major obstacles to community 
 integration which may result directly from ABI as well as problems in the 
 social and physical environment. Periodic re-evaluation with MPAI-4 
 during postacute rehabilitation or other intervention provides 
 documentation of progress and of the efficacy and appropriateness of the 
 intervention. 
 Solution 3:
 The MPAI-4 instrument was developed as an additional clinical assessment 
 instrument for use in the rehabilitation evaluation of patients with 
 suspected TBI. In Inc 4, this instrument is a standalone instrument for 
 the providers. The results of the MPAI-4 can be sent back to CPRS to be 
 signed by the provider. The MPAI-4 is scored according to the guidelines 
 provided in the "Manual for the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory".
  
  
         Issue 4:  TBI Care Plan
 The TBI/Polytrauma Rehabilitation and Reintegration plan either provides 
 for, or formally links with key components of care that address the 
 lifelong needs of individuals with impairments resulting from TBI or 
 Polytrauma. Such services include, but are not limited to: inpatient 
 rehabilitation, outpatient rehabilitation, transitional rehabilitation, 
 day programs, and community re-entry programs. This includes ongoing 
 follow up and treatment, case management, coordination of services, 
 monitoring the implementation of the treatment plan, overseeing the 
 quality and intensity of VA and non-VA services, and providing education 
 and support for patients and caregivers. 
 Solution 4:
 The TBI care plan instrument was developed as an additional clinical 
 assessment instrument for use in the rehabilitation evaluation of 
 patients with suspected TBI. The results of the care plan can be sent 
 back to CPRS to be signed by the provider.
  
  
         Issue 5:  Standardize Follow-up form to be more like 
 Comprehensive TBI Evaluation form
 In order to implement a common user interface, the original TBI 
 Comprehensive and Follow-up Evaluation forms were updated to display on 
 screen consistent with how the new instruments were done. This will 
 provide a consistent look-n-feel to all of the instruments and provides 
 the user with a standard experience.
 Solution 5:
 Redisplay the questions in the same fashion as the two new instruments 
 listed above. There was a clear difference in how these instruments 
 appeared and by changing how the questions are displayed improves the 
 user experience
