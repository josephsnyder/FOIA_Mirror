 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =================
 Problem 1: HD0000000071150 - ADDENDUM ALERTS FIRING TO SELF WHEN COSIGNING
 ----------
  Addendum alerts are sent incorrectly in scenarios like the following:
  
  Step 1:  A resident enters a note, names an attending physician as
           co-signer, and signs it.
  Step 2:  Resident enters addendum and signs.
  Step 3:  The attending physician signs the note.  An addendum alert gets
           sent to him/her incorrectly.  Addendum alerts should only be
           sent when someone other than the expected signer or co-signer
           signs the note.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
  Corrected the code to only send an alert if the person attempting to sign
  the addendum is not the expected cosigner.
  
 Routines: TIUALRT
  
  
 Problem 2: HD0000000070738 - COSIGNATURE REQUIRED FOR USER SIGNING ON
                              BEHALF OF COSIGNER
 ----------          
  For notes that require a cosigner, if the expected cosigner signs before 
  the person requiring the signature, the note is signed for both people
  with one signing action.  If a third party attempts to sign the note,
  providing they have the authorization, they are prompted twice for both
  signatures instead of only once as in the previous instance.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
  Any authorized third party will be prompted only once for their 
  signature.  
  
 ** NOTE: Business rules need to be set up accordingly for this to work. **
 ** See the post-install section for important details.                  **

 Problem 3: HD00000000119494 - Problem with Entered by field on op report 
                               addendums  
 ----------
  When adding an addendum to an Operation report in TIU List Manager, the 
  default value for the Entered By field (#1302) shows the user's DUZ 
  instead of the name.  Also, if you hit <return> there, you get a ??.
  
 Resolution 3:
 -------------
  The input template [TIU ENTER/EDIT SURGICAL REPORTS] has been changed to
  correct the problem.
  
  
 Problem 4: HD0000000067905 - Progress notes w/amendments do not display
 ----------           
  The caption AMENDMENT FILED does not display on Progress Notes or 
  Discharge Summaries that have a status of Amended when viewed in Health 
  Summary, either via List Manager or CPRS GUI.  This goes for Health 
  Summary components Progress Notes (PN), Selected Progress Notes (SPN), 
  and Discharge Summaries (DCS).
   
 Resolution 4:
 -------------
  The TIU API responsible for providing the data to Health Summary was not 
  including  information from field #1601 of the TIU DOCUMENT(#8925)file, 
  which is what Health Summary uses to determine whether or not the 
  AMENDMENT FILED caption should be shown at the end of the document.

 This patch is exported using KIDS.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, though it is recommended 
 that it be scheduled off hours, and not when the TIU NIGHTLY TASK is 
 scheduled. Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
   
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*227):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*227.
  
 5.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         NO//', respond NO.
  
 6.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
  
 POST INSTALL:
 =============
  A new business rule will need to be set up for one-time concurrent 
  signature/cosignature by third-party individuals.  The rules may vary 
  from site to site but will have the following format:
  
  An UNSIGNED <XXXXX> may BE COSIGNED by a <XXXXX>
  
  *You will also need the usual rule for them to sign the unsigned note:
  An UNSIGNED <XXXXX> may BE SIGNED by a <XXXXX>
  
  If not set up like this, pre-patch functionality will apply; the 
  third-party individual will need to sign/cosign the note with two 
  separate actions.
  
  
  ---------- IMPORTANT INFORMATION ----------
  
  A loophole may exist when business rules and document parameters are set
  up in conflict. 
  
  This can occur when an authorized third-party cosigner, as defined by 
  ASU business rules, requires cosignature by the document's parameters 
  for the note they are trying to sign.  Therefore when this is the case,
  the following behavior can be expected:
  
    - For notes with an unsigned status, the code will check for this
      condition and only sign the note, putting it into uncosigned
      status.  Otherwise the note will be completed.
  
    - For notes with an uncosigned status, the loophole will occur and 
      the note will be completed.
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  * As a reminder, according to section 1907.01 of the VHA HANDBOOK:
  
    Policies, procedures and ASU rules must be established at each facility
    to ensure only authorized individuals document in the health record and
    that the author(s) and any required cosigner(s) are identified. ASU
    rules must be in concert with facility By-laws and facility policy.
  
   THIS INCLUDES HAVING YOUR ASU RULES IN AGREEMENT WITH TIU DOCUMENT 
   PARAMETERS.
