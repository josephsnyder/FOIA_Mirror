Subject: COMPENSATION AND PENSION (C&P) UPLOAD PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  
 1. When C&P exam result records fail to upload, the current 
    review/resolution process can obstruct the user from updating the 
    correct C&P exam record. 
  
 2. TIU C&P upload allows an update to an exam record with a 'completed'
    status. Uploaded exam results should only post to records with an 
    'open' status.

  PROBLEM 1:
  ==========
   The Upload Documents [TIU UPLOAD DOCUMENTS] option is designed to use 
   The Internal Record Number (IEN) of the entry in the 2507 EXAM file 
   (#396.4) when uploading Compensation and Pension Exam Results. When a
   C&P exam result is uploaded using Upload Documents [TIU UPLOAD 
   DOCUMENTS] option and the transcribed data does not match the C&P exam
   request in file 396.4 (2507 EXAM FILE) the upload fails. A filing error
   message is displayed to the user executing the upload. The failed record
   may be resolved using Review Upload Filing Events [TIU REVIEW FILING
   EVENTS] option or by going into VA View Alerts and processing the alert.
   When the user selects the 'Display/Fix' action the record header text
   is displayed. By selecting the action 'Resolve' the next user prompt
   displayed is "Inquire to patient record? YES//" as shown in the example
   below:
  
     $HDR:                                   C&P EXAM
     EXAM REF #:                             41806   
     PATIENT NAME:                           TIUPATIENT,ONE
     DATE OF EXAM:                           1/23/09
     EXAMINING PHYSICIAN:                    HULET, LEEANN
     PATIENT SSN:                            ***********
     EXAM TYPE:                              TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI)
     $TXT
        This is the text in the transcribed record.   
     $END
  
     Inquire to patient record? YES// 
  
   When the user responds 'yes' to the prompt above the next prompt is:
  
     Select 2507 EXAM REFERENCE NUMBER:
  
   The user types in the number displayed below "C&P EXAM" and press's 
   enter. The user expects the displayed patient's exam record to be echoed
   back, but in many cases a different patient's exam record is returned.
   Depending on the sites C&P EXAM document definition the value displayed
   is not always the value that the record should be matched to.
  
   The next user prompt displayed below the returned record is:
      
      "... OK? YES//"
  
   Both Y (yes) and N (no) responses update the record that was returned
   and displayed from the inquiry above. The current process is a 
   dictionary lookup. Even though the user can see this is not the correct
   patient they are unable to prevent the incorrect update at this point.  
  
   
  PROBLEM 1 RESOLUTION:
  =====================
   Change the "Resolve" action for failed C&P uploads in option Review 
   Upload Filing Events [TIU REVIEW FILING EVENTS] by removing the
   dictionary lookup and instead go directly to the buffered upload data.
   This allows the user to edit the incorrect data in the upload header and
   re-file the record. The edit buffered upload data code currently exists
   and the removal of the erroneous dictionary lookup is the only change to
   the process.  When re-filing the buffer data the same code that is
   executed on the original upload is used to verify validity of the
   upload.
   
  PROBLEM 2:
  ==========
   When C&P results are uploaded using Upload Documents [TIU UPLOAD
   DOCUMENTS]option the uploaded results are allowed to post to the exam
   request regardless of the requests (#.04) STATUS field in EXAM file
   (#396.4).
   
  PROBLEM 2 RESOLUTION:
  =====================
   Check the (#.04) STATUS field in file 396.4 (2507 EXAM FILE) before
   posting uploaded C&P results to exam requests. C&P uploaded results
   will only be posted when the status equals 'O' for OPEN. 
   
 ********************************************************************
 NOTE: Detailed instructions on how to upload Compensation and Pension 
 C&P) Exam Results into Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) 
 2507 EXAM file (#396.4)  can be found in patch TIU*1.0*68. If sites 
 are not using the C&P upload as described in patch TIU*1.0*68 they 
 should set up the C&P upload document as described in TIU*1.0*68 and
 use the error alert process described in Problem 1 resolution.
  
 Patch DVBA*2.7*132 modified Manual Printing of New C&P Requests 
 [DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P REQUESTS] option and  Print New C&P Requests
 (Task Manager) [TASK M  DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P REQ TM] option. These print
 requests now display the IEN of the entry (.001)field in EXAM file 
 (#396.4)that is used for C&P uploads. These are the only options 
 available to users that display the IEN of the entry (.001) field in 
 EXAM file (#396.4).  These print options are used by TIU transcribers
 to assist with the upload C&P data.
