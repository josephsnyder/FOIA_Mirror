Subject: DEPLOY NATIONAL DC/TITLE PAIR FOR TBI POLYTRAUMA

Category: 
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch deploys the TBI/POLYTRAUMA DOCUMENTS / TBI/POLYTRAUMA 
 REHABILITATION/REINTEGRATION PLAN OF CARE Document Class/Title Pair in
 support of NSR #20080818. It maps the newly introduced TBI/POLYTRAUMA
 REHABILITATION/REINTEGRATION PLAN OF CARE National Title to the TBI
 TREATMENT PLAN NOTE Enterprise Standard Title, and if possible, activates
 the new title. It will optionally allow the site to attach the new 
 TBI/POLYTRAUMA REHABILITATION/REINTEGRATION PLAN OF CARE National Title to
 a local document class at the Clinical Application Coordinator's (CAC's)
 discretion.
  
 Build Components:
 ================
  
 ROUTINE:
   TIUE246
 This is the environment check routine for patch TIU*1*246. Prior to 
 installation, the routine checks to see whether the user is a member of 
 the Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) User Class. If not, it will
 prompt the user to affirm that they either have a CAC present with them, 
 or have consulted a CAC, in order to offer an informed decision as to 
 which Document Class the new Title should be assigned to (with the new 
 National TBI/POLYTRAUMA DOCUMENTS as default). It will also detect the 
 case where the installation is complete, and if necessary, allow the site 
 to move the Title to a different Document Class, cleaning up any residue 
 in the process.
  
   TIUP246
 This is the pre- and post-install routine for patch TIU*1*246. Before the
 installation, it cleans out any prior instances of the REMINDERS EXCHANGE
 FILE ENTRY that deploys the TBI/POLYTRAUMA DOCUMENTS / TBI/POLYTRAUMA 
 REHABILITATION/REINTEGRATION PLAN OF CARE Document Class / Title Pair.
 Following installation, it invokes the Reminders Exchange Utility's Silent
 Installer to introduce the new TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION entries to file
 8925.1; maps the new TBI/POLYTRAUMA REHABILITATION/REINTEGRATION PLAN OF
 CARE Title to the TREATMENT PLAN NOTE Enterprise Standard Title; activates
 the new title; and attaches the new Document Class to the PROGRESS NOTES
 class.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 This patch is deployed in a common KIDS distribution with PXRM*2*15, and 
 can only be installed in conjunction with that patch. Follow the 
 installation instructions provided with PXRM*2*15, along with its 
 Installation and Set Up Guide, to complete the installation of both 
 patches.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 1. Optional: If you're satisfied that the installation process completed 
    without error, and you don't need to review the code for any reason, 
    you may wish to delete routines TIUE246 and TIUP246 using the Kernel
    "Delete Routines" option [XTRDEL].
