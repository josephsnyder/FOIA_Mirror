 This patch addresses six problems.  Undefined errors in routine TIUR and
 TIURL, the printing of additional signature on a Progress Note, and
 incorrect updating of the "ACL" index in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1)

 1.  HD0000000069457 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If a user is looking at unsigned progress notes in LM and someone
     in another KEA session or CPRS GUI session deletes one of the notes on
     the list, and the original user selects to Browse the deleted note, it
     will generate an error.
  
     Resolution:

     Put a check in routine TIURL to make sure the selected item from the
     list is still present.

     Problem:
     --------

     the name of the additional signer.

     Problem:
     --------
     In multiple options where you enter selection criteria for notes you
     want to search for, if you enter an "*" at the Status prompt, you will
     get an undefined error in TIUR or TIURM depending on which option you
     are using.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routines TIUR and TIURM to properly evaluate the Status
     entered.

 4.  HD0000000169774
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If a user in Edit Document, Edit Basics changes the status of the
     title to INACTIVE before making changes to the Abbreviaiton or Print
     Name field the "ACL" xref in 8925.1 is not updated correctly.  Since
     this is the index used in CPRS GUI to look up titles it causes a
     problem.  This can also result in the old Abbreviation or Print Name
     not being removed.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine TIUDD1 to update the "ACL" index if the status of the
     title is INACTIVE.
