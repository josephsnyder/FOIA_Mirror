 Description:
 ===========
   
 A problem has been found with VistA patch TIU*1.0*215, released June 28, 
 2007.  One of the intents of this patch was to only allow editing/amending
 etc. from the Surgery package to keep the Surgery file (#130) and
 TIU files in sync.  This was for the Nurse Intraoperative Report(NIR)
 and the Anesthesia Report only.  However, if surgery personnel made 
 changes to a surgery case using one of the case editors such as OSS
 Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT], they were asked if they wanted to
 create an addendum.  After installation of TIU*1.0*215, the addendum was
 not created for viewing via the Surgery Tab in CPRS, however, the data was
 being updated in the Surgery application files.
  
 PSI-07-124
  
 Patch TIU*1.0*236, which was an emergency patch released 11/15/2007,
 restored the routines to the pre TIU*1.0*215 versions.
  
 Surgery does not have any type of audit trail or time stamp of any 
 changes.  Therefore, cases displayed on this report need to be compared 
 MANUALLY (TIU to Surgery) to each other.  
  
 For cases where the TIU note has an addendum, this does not necessarily 
 indicate the existence of a discrepancy.  This is due to the difference 
 in the way the Surgery record is stored vs. the TIU record.  Edits in 
 Surgery change the contents of the Surgery record, while the 
 corresponding TIU note an addendum created.
  
 A new option TIU 215 ANALYSIS is set up with installation of this 
 patch and is being added as sequence 14 to the TIU MAIN MENU MGR option.

               V      VIEW SINGLE SURGERY CASE USING CASE #
               T      SEND ANALYSIS OUTPUT TO TEXT FILE
  
  
 The install routine asks for a start date to begin searching for Surgery 
 cases.  This date should be determined by the Surgery ADPAC, and will be 
 sometime before TIU*1.0*215 was loaded.  This is because a Surgery case
 could have been started well before TIU*1.0*215 was loaded, but edited
 during the timeframe that TIU*1.0*215 was installed in production.  An end
 date is then asked for, which would be the date TIU*1.0*215 was backed
 out. The install routine will run upon installation and send a mailman
 message to the installer with a list of Surgery cases that need to be
 reviewed.  The installer should forward the Mailman message (MM) to the
 Surgery ADPAC, Chief Health Information Management (HIM) or other
 appropriate personnel, and the IRM person that will work with the ADPAC to
 fix any problems. The post-install instructions should be followed at this
 point.

 A mailman message will be generated after the installation of this 
 patch. The subj line reads: "ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY 
 PATCH TIU*1.0*215 
  
  
 POST-INSTALL:
 =============
 The install routine will run upon installation and send a mailman message
 to the installer with a list of Surgery cases that need to be reviewed.  
 The installer should forward the Mailman message (MM) to the Surgery
 ADPAC,  Chief Health Information Management (HIM)or other appropriate
 personnel and the IRM person that will work with the ADPAC to fix any
 problems.
  
 Reminder:  Make sure the Surgery ADPAC Health Information Management
 (HIM), and/or other designated persons are involved in this process.
  
 The purpose of the post-install is to identify and correct any 
 information that may be out of sync between Surgery and TIU concerning 
 NIR and Anesthesia reports.  It should be kept in mind that the Surgery
 record contains the correct and updated information, while the TIU record
 may not.
  
 A new option (14 TIU 215 ANALYSIS) will be set up with the installation 
 of this patch.

         14 TIU 215 ANALYSIS ... 
               A      ANALYZE POTENTIAL SURGERY TIU PROBLEMS
               V      VIEW SINGLE SURGERY CASE USING CASE #
               T      SEND ANALYSIS OUTPUT TO TEXT FILE
  
  
   Option A -  ANALYZE POTENTIAL SURGERY TIU PROBLEMS
  
   Allows for the analysis process (which was run during the installation
   of this patch) to be run again. Surgery cases will be analyzed within a 
   particular date range and the information from NIR and/or Anesthesia
   reports will be compared to their corresponding TIU notes.  If the
   information does not match, the case number will be recorded as one that
   needs to be reviewed. The information generated by this option should be
   printed, either by cutting and pasting the results into a text file, or
   you can simply print the MM that was generated during installation.  It
   can be used to identify which TIU records have addenda and which do
   not.  This is extremely important as how a comparison is handled depends
   directly on if the TIU record has addenda.  It can also be used as a
   checklist, to make sure that every record in question is examined.
  
  *Note: The MM from the install does not contain patient names, only the 
   first character of the last name followed by the last 4 of the social 
   security number.  When the utility is run from the menu, however, it 
   prints the full patient name.
  
 ***Options V and T are available to assist with comparison and cleanup***
  
   Option V - VIEW THE CONTENTS OF A SURGERY CASE USING CASE #
  
   Views the content ofa Surgery Case file (#130). NIR data
   will be displayed followed by the Anesthesia data.
  
   Option T - SEND OUTPUT TO TEXT FILE
  
   Sends output to a Host text file on your production account's
   server. This will be very useful for sites that have a large number of
   cases to review.  Microsoft Word can then be used to compare the text
   files, which is extremely helpful because discrepancies are
   automatically highlighted, thus expediting the  comparison process.
  
 Option T overview:
 ==================
 Option T will send data from both Surgery and TIU to respective output 
 files.  First, the user is prompted for a path to send output files to 
 which should look something like this:  USER$:[<directory name>] .  You 
 may need to coordinate with your local IRM VistA system administrator to
 determine exactly what the path should be.  The user is then prompted for
 three filenames; one for Surgery output, one for TIU output, and one for
 associated TIU addenda.  If the path and/or filenames are invalid you will
 be prompted to enter them again.
  
 Option T will use the same analysis technique as Option A does.  
 Instead of just listing cases that need review, it will write the contents
 of the associated reports to text files.  For each case, what is 
 on record in Surgery will be written to one file, and what is on record 
 in TIU will be written to another file. Also, if there are any associated
 TIU addenda with the case, these addendums  will be written to a
 separate file.  Multiple cases will be written to a single file, with the
 user pre-defining the maximum limit. When this limit is encountered, a new
 set of output files will be created.  For instance, if there are a total
 of 50 cases found with possible discrepancies, and the user sets a maximum
 of 25 cases per file, then 2 Surgery output files will be created, two TIU
 output files, and x number of addenda output files. Note: The number of
 Surgery and TIU files will always be the same; the number of addenda files
 may not. This is due to the fact not every Surgery case will have an
 associated TIU addenda). Let's say the names "Surgery", "TIU", and
 "ADDENDA" are used for the output filenames, you would then have:
 Surgery1.txt, Surgery2.txt, TIU1.txt, TIU2.txt, and ADDENDA1.txt (and
 possibly ADDENDA2.txt), each with 25 cases per file.
  
  
 ***IMPORTANT*****************IMPORTANT****************IMPORTANT*******
  
 NOTE!!!! The host files created in option T contains Patient 
 Information and should only be sent to a server within the system boundary
 of the VA.  The directory must be password protected. If you are going
 to download to a pc for the Microsoft Word Compare for analysis it must be
 a VA approved encrypted PC. Both the host files and the files downloaded
 to the pc must be destroyed by an approved means when analysis/correction
 is complete. When the files are destroyed the systems manager, official, 
 or the ISO should be notified they have been destroyed.
  
 ***IMPORTANT******************IMPORTANT******************IMPORTANT*****
  
  
  
 IMPORTANT!!!!  READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS
  
 The compare feature in Word may not give the desired results.  If this is
 the case, you will have to switch the order in which you open the files
 for comparison.
  
 1) Open up your TIU .txt file as plain text
 **Note: You may have to set 'Files of type' to All Files (*.*) or Text 
 Files (*.txt) to see text files in your directory browser.
  
 2) Go to the Tools menu option and select 'Compare and Merge Documents'
  
 3) A file browser window will open up.  Select the Surgery .TXT file as 
 plain text.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SELECT 'MERGE INTO NEW DOCUMENT' IN 
 THE DROP-DOWN BOX! 
  
 Simply double-clicking on the file, or just hitting the Merge button can
 show an erroneous compare.  You can tell if your compare is correct by
 first finding a Surgery case where the corresponding TIU note DOES NOT
 CONTAIN any addenda.  Look at what data is underlined vs. what is crossed
 out (or marked as deleted).  If you see a pattern where items are crossed
 out, yet you know they are what is currently in the Surgery record, THIS
 IS BACKWARDS.  These items should be underlined, while a crossed out item
 should represent what is in the original TIU note and not in Surgery.  If
 you encounter this situation, simply close Word and start over.  This time
 open your Surgery output file first, then the TIU one, with the Merge and
 Compare option under the Tools menu.
  
 4) You should now see the compared documents as one (hereafter referred 
 to as the compare document), with underlined highlighted text indicating 
 information not present in the original TIU note. Information that has 
 been edited is shown one of two ways: either in an outlined box or with a 
 strikethrough.  The outlined box will contain what was originally in the
 TIU record pointing to what is currently contained in the Surgery record
 (outlined boxes have the caption 'Deleted' in them).  For information 
 that has a strikethough, it is simply right next to the information that 
 is in the Surgery record.
  
  
 Interpreting your compared documents:
 ==================================== 
 As mentioned before, Surgery cases where the TIU notes have addenda need 
 to be treated differently than ones that do not.  Use the list printed 
 from Option 1 (or MM message generated during the installation) to
 determine if the note has addenda. 
  
 The two processes are outlined below:
  
 **TIU records WITHOUT addenda - The discrepancies listed in the compare 
 document generated by Word need to be added to the TIU record by the 
 process described in the CORRECTION PROCESS section.
  
 **TIU records WITH addenda - This process is a bit more complex. The 
 way Surgery edits are handled in TIU, the presence of  an addenda 
 automatically causes the records not to match when doing a checksum 
 compare.  Therefore, some cases may be legitimate (information is in sync 
 with the supporting addenda) while others are not.  Every individual 
 discrepancy in the compare document needs to be examined, and if the 
 information is not present in an addendum of the TIU note, it needs to be 
 added using the process described in the CORRECTION PROCESS section.  The
 addenda output file can help with this, as all addenda associated with
 their corresponding TIU case will be included in that file.
  
  
 Detail on NIR:
 ============= 
 When entering the NIR it allows you to enter Anesthesia Technique data.  
 If the data is present when the note is signed, the NIR is created in TIU
 with the data.  If it was not added prior to signing and is entered after
 signing, an addendum will be created. If you go back into Surgery after 
 the Anesthesia Technique data created the addendum, and change or enter
 additional data other than the Anesthesia Technique, it does not create an
 addendum to the NIR. Another addendum will only be created if the
 Anesthesia Technique is changed. According to Surgery developers this
 is by design as technically only the Anesthesia Technique is a part of  
 the NIR.
  
 Data added after the Anesthesia technique was completed and sent to TIU
 will put the case on the review list.
  
  
 *Note: If the site does use the Anesthesia report and the Anesthesia
 technique data is changed, an addendum is created in TIU.
  
  
 CORRECTION PROCESS:
 =================== 
 The following manual fix process is provided by the Surgery Enterprise
 Product Support(EPS) personnel:
  
 ==========================================================================
 The Surgery ADPAC should review the reports. Health Information 
 Management (HIM) personnel should also be involved in this process.
  
 If the programmer feels comfortable in restoring the data in the Surgery 
 package to what it was originally, then the programmer can with the help 
 of the Surgery ADPAC do it, but we would encourage the site to enter a 
 Surgery Remedy ticket, and we will step the site through the process.
  
 The programmer would edit the fields in the Surgery Case file (#130) that
 should be restored to their original data using FileMan enter/edit.
  
 For the NIR, once the cases that need fixing are restored to their 
 original data set(see examples one and two), one of the circulating nurses
 listed in the case, with the assistance of the Surgery ADPAC, should use
 the Surgery package to put the changes back into the cases and sign the
 addenda (see Options used to reenter the data in Surgery).
  
 Similarly for the Anesthesia Report, once the cases that need fixing are 
 restored to their original data set (see examples one and two), the
 anesthetist with the assistance of the Surgery ADPAC, should use the
 Surgery package to put the changes back into the cases and sign the
 addenda (see Options used to reenter the data in Surgery).
