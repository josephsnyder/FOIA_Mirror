Description:
============

 VHA Directive 2008-042 requires the development of a standard method for 
 the computation of line counts for transcribed documents, along with a 
 report for validating the bills provided by transcription vendors. This 
 patch is an attempt to satisfy the requirements of that directive.

          DESCRIPTION:  A VBC Line is defined as the total number of
                        characters you can see with the naked eye,
                        divided by 65. It includes any character
                        contained within a header or footer. Spaces,
                        carriage returns, and hidden format 
                        instructions, such as bold, underline, text
                        boxes, printer configurations, spell check,
                        etc., are not counted in the total character count.
                        A VBC Line is calculated by counting all visual
                        characters and simply dividing the total number of
                        characters by 65 to arrive at the number of defined
                        lines.

   TIU VBC LINE COUNT REPORT                    SEND TO SITE
     This option produces a report for the verification of transcription 
     bills, using the Visible Black Character counting method described in
     VHA Directive 2008-042.
  
 PARAMETER DEFINITION:
   TIU USER CLASS FOR VBC                       SEND TO SITE
     This parameter identifies the User Class whose members should have
     Visible Black Character Line Counts reported for the TIU documents
     which they enter (e.g., Contract Transcriptionists).
  
     If defined, the TIU Billing Verification Report will include documents
     entered by members of this class. If left undefined, the TIU Billing
     Verification Report will include any document entered by a person who
     is neither the author or expected cosigner (which could include
     in-house transcriptionists, secretaries, technicians, or students, who
     "ghost-write" documents on behalf of licensed providers, who in turn
     must review/sign the content).
  
     If you discover that the Billing Verification Report at your station 
     includes an unacceptable number of documents entered by users whose
     work should not be included in the report, you can "filter the noise"
     by identifying a User Class using this parameter, and making sure that
     only the people whose work should be reported are added as members to
     that User Class.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it should
 be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users.
 Installation of this patch should take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.  
   
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
    select the Installation menu.  
  
 3. From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
    options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*250): 
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global 
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*250.
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
    Install? NO//', press <Enter> or respond NO, unless menus haven't been
    rebuilt recently, and you're confident that disabling ^-jumping during
    the process won't pose an inconvenience to your users.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    press <Enter> or respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//', respond YES, and DISABLE the TIU* Options and
    Protocols.
  
  
 Post-installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 Consider whether you have many cases in which persons other than contract 
 transcriptionists (e.g., students, technicians, secretaries, in-house 
 transcriptionists, etc.) will be entering documents into TIU on behalf of
 the author. If that is the case, and you would prefer NOT to have the 
 work of those persons included in the Transcription Billing Verification 
 Report, then you should:
  
    1. Select an existing User Class, or create a new User Class (as
       described in the Authorization/Subscription Utility (ASU) Clinical
       Coordinator Manual) to identify the people whose work should
       generate Visible Black Character Line counts, and be tracked in the
       Transcription Billing Verification Report. For example, if you'd
       like to restrict the report to include only the work of Contract 
       Transcriptionists, you might create a class called "Contract 
       Transcriptionists" and add the appropriate users to that class.
  
    2. Using the option XPAR EDIT PARAMETER, set the value of the TIU USER
       CLASS FOR VBC to identify the user class for which VBC Line Counts
       will be tracked. Note that you can set the parameter at either the
       System or Division level, in the event that you'd like to identify
       different User Classes to accommodate different needs at Multi-
       divisional facilities. Moreover, you may be able to leverage the
       inheritance of membership in ancestor User Classes to tailor the
       behavior of the report to meet your site's needs (e.g., if "Contract
       Transcriptionist" is set up as a sub-class of "Transcriptionist",
       all members of the sub-class are recognized as members of the
       parent class as well).
