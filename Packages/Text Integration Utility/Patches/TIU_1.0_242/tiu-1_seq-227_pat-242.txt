 This patch deploys the SECURE MESSAGING DOCUMENTS / SECURE MESSAGING

 DIALOG NOTE Enterprise Standard Title, and if possible, activates the new

 ROUTINE:
   TIUP242
 This is the pre- and post-install routine for patch TIU*1*242. Before the
 installation, it cleans out any prior instances of the REMINDERS EXCHANGE
 FILE ENTRY that deploys the SECURE MESSAGING DOCUMENTS / SECURE MESSAGING
 Document Class / Title Pair. Following installation, it invokes the
 Reminders Exchange Utility's Silent Installer to introduce the new TIU
 DOCUMENT DEFINITION entries to file 8925.1; maps the new SECURE MESSAGING
 Title to the MHV DIALOG NOTE Enterprise Standard Title; activates the new
 SECURE MESSAGING TITLE; and attaches the SECURE MESSAGING DOCUMENTS
 Document Class to the PROGRESS NOTES class.
