Description:
============

 Patch TIU*1*234 makes 4 changes:
  
 First, it prevents the text of ALL signed documents from being edited.
  
 Second, it prohibits all users except Privacy Act Officers or MIS/HIM
 Chiefs from AMENDING ALL documents.
  
 These 2 changes are required by the OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL and by
 HIMS.  The prohibitions function regardless of business rules and apply 
 in both VISTA and the CPRS GUI.
  
             ****** IMPORTANT BUSINESS RULE NOTE ******
 All business rules mentioned in USR*1*31 except the one AMEND rule must
 STILL be changed as required by patch USR*1*31. See section II on Business
 Rules.
                        *************************
  
 Third, this patch adds Clinical Procedures (CP) to the types of documents
 whose Expected Cosigners can be changed using VISTA option EDIT COSIGNER
 (EC), which was sent out in TIU*1*220.
  
 Fourth, it corrects an error by which National Standard Titles were 
 inadvertently removed from the CPRS GUI Document Display.
  
  
 I. DESCRIPTION:
 ===============
  
             ****** IMPORTANT PRE-INSTALLATION NOTE ******
  
 Site User Class managers must check several User Classes BEFORE this patch
 can be installed.  If sites do not have at least one of User
 Classes
   CHIEF, MIS 
   CHIEF, HIM or 
   PRIVACY ACT OFFICER 
 exactly as named, the patch will not install.  See paragraphs AMENDING
 DOCUMENTS IS LIMITED TO SPECIFIC USER CLASSES and PRE-INSTALLATION
 INSTRUCTIONS, below. *************************
  
  
 1. TEXT EDIT OF SIGNED DOCUMENTS IS PROHIBITED
 TIU*1*234 prevents the text of signed documents from being edited. 
 This is accomplished by adding status UNCOSIGNED to existing prohibitions.
 Users who attempt to edit the text of signed documents will receive the
 message,
    'You may not edit uncosigned or completed documents.'
  
 2. AMENDING DOCUMENTS IS LIMITED TO SPECIFIC USER CLASSES
 Action AMEND is limited to members of User Classes CHIEF, MIS; CHIEF, HIM;
 or PRIVACY ACT OFFICER. Other users who attempt to AMEND documents will
 receive the message,
   'Only Privacy Act Officers or MIS/HIM Chiefs may amend documents.'
  
 In order to ensure that sites are prepared for this change, the patch 
 cannot be installed until the necessary User Classes for action AMEND
 exist at the site.  See PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
  
 These changes are required by the OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL and by
 HIMS. The prohibition/limitations function regardless of business rules.  
 They apply in both VISTA and CPRS GUI options.
  
             ****** IMPORTANT BUSINESS RULE NOTE ******
 All business rules mentioned in USR*1*31 except the one AMEND rule 
 must STILL be changed as required by patch USR*1*31. See section II on
 Business Rules.
                        *************************
  
 3. CP and VISTA option EDIT COSIGNER (EC)
 Expected Cosigners of CP can now be edited using hidden VISTA option EC.  
 See the NPM entry for TIU*1*220 for details regarding other document
 types. Note that this is a separate option from the general EDIT option,
 which is no longer permitted for signed documents.
  
 VISTA option EDIT COSIGNER (EC) also adds a new requirement for Discharge
 Summary Attending Physicians (DS Attendings). Until future patches are
 released this applies in Option EC ONLY. Option EC does not accept a DS
 Attending if they require cosignature for the document. They must also be
 in USER CLASS PROVIDER.
 See Section NEW ATTENDING REQUIREMENT DETAILS.
  
 4. DISPLAY LACKS STANDARD TITLES
 TIU*1*234 also corrects an error by which National Standard Titles were
 inadvertently removed from CPRS GUI Document Displays.
  
  
 NEW ATTENDING REQUIREMENT DETAILS
 In anticipation of later patches, TIU*1*234 changes option EC (only) to
 apply new requirements for selecting DS Attendings. The change is
 currently operative only in the EC option.
  
 The new Attending Requirement was made by the Clinical Workgroup.  It 
 dictates that Attendings for DS must be in User Class PROVIDER, may
 not be terminated, and may not themselves require cosignature.  This
 change will be made in TIU*1*219 and in CPRS GUI V27. These are scheduled
 to be released together sometime after TIU*1*234.
  
 Whether someone is active in a particular User Class is date-dependent.  
 The date used here to determine active membership is the Date of Dictation
 (not the current date).
  
 In TIU*1*234 the LIST of possible selections in VISTA option EC when the 
 user enters '??' when selecting an Attending does not eliminate users who
 require cosignature. In the future, this list WILL eliminate these users 
 from the list in VISTA option EC.  This change will take place 
 automatically when patches TIU*1*219 and CPRS GUI V27 are released.
  
  
 II. Business Rules
 ==================
 1. ACTION EDIT
 Business Rules for action EDIT RECORD for **SIGNED** documents are
 irrelevant as of TIU*1*234. If sites still have such rules, they should
 remove any such rules. This will prevent confusion in the future for
 inspections and reviews.(Sites should have removed these rules when
 USR*1*26 was released.)
  
 2. ACTION AMEND
 Business Rules for action AMEND are irrelevant as of TIU*1*234. Sites
 should remove any AMEND rules. This will prevent confusion in the future
 for inspections and reviews.
  
 3. All business rules mentioned in USR*1*31 must STILL be changed 
 as required by patch USR*1*31.  The one exception is the one AMEND rule
 for LR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY documents, which must be removed, not changed.
  
 4. EDIT COSIGNER for CP
 If current rules for action EDIT COSIGNER do not include CP, you will 
 need to add them.  See TIU*1*220 for details.
  
  
  
 III. E3Rs and Remedy Tickets
 ============================
 E3Rs
 ====
 The following E3R is resolved by this patch:
 E3R No.:  17062, EXPECTED CO-SIGNER CAN BE CHANGED WITHOUT AUDIT
  
 This E3R describes a situation in which the text of a signed note can be 
 edited without the signature being scrambled.  TIU*1*234 prevents this 
 scenario by prohibiting the Expected Cosigner from editing the note text 
 in the first place.
  
 Other aspects of this E3R have been resolved in previous patches.
  
 REMEDY TICKETS
 ==============
 The following Remedy tickets are fully or partially satisfied by this 
 patch:                                                   
 HD0000000186686 TIU*1*152 did not include 'uncosigned' state
 HD000000069237 DUR-0300-31223  inconsistency in expected co-signer
 HD0000000213674 Cannot edit un-cosigned clinical procedure notes

 HD0000000176501 COSIGNATURE NOT REQUIRED MESSAGE AFTER 220
  
  
 IV. New Service Request 20070921
 ================================
 NSR 20070921 - Automate Steps from Informational Patch Outlined in
   USR*1*31
 This NSR is resolved by TIU*1*234, but in a more robust way than the NSR
 title indicates.
  
 The NSR concern is that users be prevented from changing the text of a 
 TIU document once the document has been signed.  This includes actions 
 EDIT and AMEND.  The NSR is resolved as follows:
 First, TIU*1*234 prevents the text of signed documents from being edited.
 Second, it prohibits all users except Privacy Act Officers or MIS/HIM
 Chiefs from AMENDING documents.
  
 These prohibitions/limitations disregard Business Rules.
  
 V. DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL
 ==========================
  Several TIU Manuals have been updated to reflect the enhancements
  provided by this patch. The updated documentation is available in the
  form of (.PDF) files, as follows:
    TIUUM.PDF       TIU User Manual
    TIUIM.PDF       TIU Implementation Guide
    TIUIG.PDF       TIU Installation Guide 
  The files can be retrieved in BINARY format by FTP. The preferred
  method is to FTP the files from:
  
     download.vista.med.va.gov    
  
  which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP location
  at the following locations:
  
   CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
