 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
  
 1. HD0000000069695 - Copy a title function broken...Copied Title Displays
  
    Problem
    -------
    When using Copy to create a new document, the print name from the original 
    document is used as the print name for the newly created document.  
    This causes a problem since the print name is displayed in CPRS.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Set the print name to be the same as the new document name when the copy 
    is made.  Note: In all cases except for an object, the print name should 
    be the same as the document name on the new document that was created.  
    The print name on an object should be blank when copied.
  
  
 2. HD0000000070760 - Make addendum on a Nurse Intra op & Anesthesia report
  
    Problem
    -------
    The Surgery, Nurse Intraoperative, and Anesthesia reports must be modified
    in the Surgery package so that the SURGERY file (#130) stays in sync
    with the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
     While accessing CPRS GUI or TIU LM options the user will not be 
     allowed to Edit, Delete (Retract), or make an Addendums to the 
     Nurse Intraoperative or Anesthesia Reports. The user will get an error
     dialogue stating these functions need to be done in the Surgery
     package. 
  
     Also, while in any of the TIU LM options listed below, do not allow 
     Amend or Verify/Unverify -> Edit functions for the Nurse Intra-
     operative or Anesthesia Reports.  There will be an error
     dialogue stating these functions need to be done in the Surgery
     package.

 3. HD0000000166528 - Interdisciplinary Notes
  
    Problem
    -------
    When attempting to delete an Interdisciplinary Parent note with Children,
    the error message is not clear.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The error message denying deletion was expanded to give more details 
    regarding the steps required if it is necessary to delete the Parent ID 
    note.
  
 4. No Associated Remedy Ticket
  
    Problem
    -------   
    Routine TIULP2 was installed with patch TIU*1*215. An error was found 
    in Patch TIU*1*215 resulting in it being marked as an 'Entered in
    Error' patch. Because of this situation not all sites installed
    TIU*1.0*215. Thus, routine TIULP2 will only be present for deletion at
    the Sites that installed TIU*1*215.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Delete routine TIULP2 (when present) when patch is loaded.
