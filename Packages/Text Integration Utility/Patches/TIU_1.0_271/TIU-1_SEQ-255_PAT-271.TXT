Subject: CORRECT ADDENDUM SEARCH RESULTS AND PREVENT DATES FROM BEING STRINGS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1) Users were not able to search for Addendums using the Multiple Patient
    Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MRT] option on the Text Integration
    Utilities (MRT) [TIU MAIN MENU MRT] main menu or the Multiple Patient
    Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MIS MANAGER] option on the Text
    Integration Utilities (MIS Manager) [TIU MAIN MENU MGR] main menu.
  
 2) String dates are being stored in the REFERENCE DATE field (#1301) of 
    the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925).

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 =============================
 1) INC000000070396 - ISL-1103-50704  Addenda search problem for Multiple
                      Patient Documents option
  Problem
  -------
  When Medical Review Technicians (MRT's) were using the Multiple Patient
  Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MRT] option on the Text Integration 
  Utilities (MRT) [TIU MAIN MENU MRT] main menu or the Multiple Patient
  Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MIS MANAGER] option on the Text Integration
  Utilities (MIS Manager)[TIU MAIN MENU MGR] main menu searching for a
  document type of Addendum, no search results were returned.  Searching
  for other document types did yield valid search results.
  
  Resolution
  ----------
  Routine TIURM1 has been modified to return addendum results instead of
  parent results when the user searches for type Addendum.
  
  
 2) INC000000151706 - String dates in file 8925
  Problem
  -------
  One or more unidentified and possibly third party applications have been
  sending the reference date to the TIU API in string format. This is
  causing trailing zeros and a possibility of incorrect ordering in cross
  references. The reference date is a multi-field cross-reference used for
  look-ups by patient, document type, status, and date range. When notes
  are displayed or printed, the child entries are normally ordered by
  reference date under the parent entry. It was determined that there is a 
  potential for the TIU Application Program Interface (API) to store a 
  string instead of a date. 
  
  Resolution
  ----------
  Routine TIUSRVP has been modified to prevent the REFERENCE DATE field
  (#1301) from being a string.
  
  ****PRE AND POST INSTALLATION NOTICE**** 
  
  *** DO NOT QUEUE THIS PATCH FOR INSTALLATION *** 
  
  There is a post install utility that needs to be queued to run at a 
  different time. You will be prompted for a time during the installation 
  of this patch. The Post Init routine can be ran while users are on the
  system and will attempt to lock TIU records before correcting the 
  reference date, but it is recommended that the post init be queued to 
  run at a different time.
  
  Any failed corrections will be reported in a mailman message with the
  subj line of: "REFERENCE DATES CORRECTED" which will be sent to both
  the installing user and the mail group G.TIU CACS. Please check the 
  mail group TIU CACS to make sure you have users defined.
  
  In order to go back and correct records that were unable to be corrected
  due to locking issues, a user with Programmer access can re-run the
  utility QUE^TIUP271 by following the steps below at the programmer 
  prompt:
  
  1) Delete the Global set when task was run by typing: K ^XTMP('TIUP271')
  
  2) Queue the task to run again by typing: D QUE^TIUP271
  
 INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 =====================
  
  *** DO NOT QUEUE THIS PATCH FOR INSTALLATION ***
  
  Installation will take less than 1 minute.
  
  *** Post install utility may take several hours. It should take 
  approximately 1 minute per million entries in the TIU file (#8925).
  Therefore, it is suggested that this utility be tasked to run after
  hours.
  
  At the following prompt, enter the time you would like the post-init 
  Routine to run:
  
  "Enter when to Queue the REFERENCE DATE UPDATE job to run in 
   date@time format:"
  
  If you choose NOT to queue the post-init task, you must not shut down or
  exit your Vista session until it shows 100% complete. If the Vista 
  session is closed, a user with programmer access will have to kill the 
  ^TMP("TIU271") global and run QUE^TIUP271 as described above.
  
  The included post-init routine (TIUP271) should be deleted after the
  tasked job "REFERENCE DATE UPDATE" completes and all records have been 
  corrected.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*271):
          a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will 
              allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are 
              in the transport global.
          b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
              the components of the KIDS build.
          c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option 
              will allow you to view all changes that will be made when 
              this patch is installed.  It compares all components of 
              this patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
          d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
              message of any routines exported with this patch. It will 
              not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
   4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
      TIU*1.0*271.
  
   5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//"
      respond NO.
  
   6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
