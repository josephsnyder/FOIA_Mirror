Associated patches: (v)TIU*1*260   <<= must be installed BEFORE `TIU*1*279'

Subject: Create Missing Patient - PRF TIU Title

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 As part of the Missing Patient - Patient Record Flag (PRF) project, patch 
 TIU*1*279 includes new development of the PRF functionality within the 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 system of applications; specifically Missing Patient PRF functionality. 
 This Missing Patient PRF functionality is to assist in fulfillment of 
 Directive 2010-052 - Management of Wandering and Missing Patients. 
  
 This Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive establishes policy to 
 ensure that each Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) medical facility 
 has an effective and reliable plan to prevent, and effectively manage 
 wandering and missing patient events that place patients at-risk for 
 harm. Patch TIU*1*279 specifically provides for linking a Text 
 Integration Utilities (TIU) Progress Note Title with the new "MISSING 
 PATIENT", PRF.
  
  
 * Note - There will be no changes to any Local Category (CAT) II PRFs 
 associated with this Missing Patient PRF project or any of its 
 components. This project is strictly creating a new, National CAT I PRF 
 and TIU note for missing patients. Each facility should manually 
 deactivate any CAT II Missing Patient PRFs and only use this newly 
 created CAT I flag going forward per VACO memo guidance dated 4/23/2013.
  
  
 FEATURES
 --------
 1. Patch TIU*1*279 creates and installs a new TIU Progress Note Title, 
 PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I - MISSING PATIENT.  This flag will have 
 the MENTAL HEALTH PATIENT RECORD FLAG Enterprise Standard Title, and 
 PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT I Document Class.  This patch creates a new entry 
 in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION File #8925.1 to create this new TIU Title.
