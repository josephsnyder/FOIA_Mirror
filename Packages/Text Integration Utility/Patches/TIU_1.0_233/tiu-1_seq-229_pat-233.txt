  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  =================
 Problem 1: HD000000069299 - ID SIGNER/CO-SIGNER
 ----------
  User A enters a note with a title that does NOT require a co-signer for 
  them.  They sign the note and identify User B as an additional signer.  
  User B DOES  require a co-signer for this title.  In this situation, user
  B should simply be able to sign the note without naming a cosigner.  If 
  a particular sequence is  followed in TIU List Manager, however, they are
  asked to name a co-signer.
  
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
  Modified the code to not ask an identified additional signer for a 
  co-signer.
  
  Routines: TIURS1
  
  
 Problem 2: HD000000069093 - Can not print warning for addendum
 ----------
  When using the Progress Notes Print Options [TIU PRINT PN] to print a 
  note, if a user is currently entering an addendum for that note the 
  'cannot print the addendum' warning gets included in the chart copy.
  Instead it should ignore the addendum the same way it does an unsigned
  addendum and not print the warning.
  
 Resolution 2:
 ------------- 
  The code has been modified to ignore any addenda in the unreleased 
  status and not print the warning.
  
  Routines: TIUPRPN1
  
  
 Problem 3: HD000000099628 - Spacebar option not working 
 ----------
  When attempting to change the title of a note, entering spacebar and 
  return at the Select Title prompt displays a ??, whereas it used to 
  return the previous title selected. (Spacebar and return works to
  recall the previous entry in most criteria areas of Vista applications.)
  
 Resolution 3:
 -------------
  An additional parameter was added to the call that rectifies the
  problem.
  
  Routines: TIUADCL
  
  
 Problem 4: HD00000094265 - Can not delete duplicate UNDICTATED Operation
 Report
 ----------
  The "Reassign" action for Operation reports was made unavailable
  some time ago due to the fact that the Surgery and TIU files point
  to each other, and all actions should be performed via the Surgery
  package to keep them in sync.  However, the "Reassign" action was
  not disabled for ADDENDA of Surgical documents, which it should have
  been.
  
 Resolution 4:
 -------------
  The code has been modified to disable the "Reassign" action for
  Surgical addenda.
