Subject: NDC SELECT, TIMEOUT ISSUE & EDIT VERIFIED INV ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following problems:
  
 1.  68175  PSAENTO    Time Out Issue
 User reported that the "Set Up/Edit a Pharmacy Location" [PSA LOCATION EDIT] 
 option does not quit properly when the application times out at the OUTPATIENT
 SITE prompt.
  
 2.  98252  PSAVERA    Daily Activity Log does not record change on CS invoice
 When using the "Edit Verified Invoices" [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] option,
 the application does not remove the correct quantity which results in 
 inaccurate quantities being recorded. 
  
 3. 119930  PSAPROC4   Multiple NDC match selection needs DUOU displayed
 When using the "Process Uploaded Prime Vendor Invoice Data" [PSA PROCESS 
 PRIME VENDOR DATA] option, the user is presented with a list of drugs and 
 related  information if multiple synonyms exist. Currently the Dose
 Unit Order Unit (DUOU) is not displayed in that information.  The lack of
 this information can result in the wrong drug being selected during invoice 
 processing.
  
 4. 191994  PSAVERA   Duplicate receipt issue
 When using the Edit Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] option to
 edit an invoice that has not been verified, the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY
 TRANSACTION file (#58.81) is updated.  Then when the user verifies the invoice
 the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION file (#58.81) is updated again causing
 duplicate transactions for the invoice item(s) that the edit was done on.

 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ==================== 
 1.  68175  PSAENTO    Time Out Issue
  
 PROBLEM
 ======= 
 User reported that the "Set Up/Edit a Pharmacy Location" [PSALOCATION EDIT] 
 option does not quit properly when the application times out at the 
 INPATIENT SITE NAME prompt
  
 RESOLUTION
 ========== 
 Modify PSAENTO routine to check the DTOUT timeout variable.  If it exists
 the routine will quit.
  
 2.  98252  PSAVERA   Daily Activity Log does not record change on CS invoice
  
 PROBLEM
 =======
 When using the "Edit Verified Invoices" [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] option,
 the application does not remove the correct quantity which results in 
 inaccurate quantities being recorded.
  
 RESOLUTION
 ==========
 PSAVERA routine will be modified to check the original transaction and use 
 that data to calculate the quantity to be removed.  The adjustments will be
 stored in EDIT VERIFIED ORDER DATE/TIME field (#48), PHARMACIST EDITING
 field (#49), NEW QUANTITY field (#50), ADJUSTED BY QUANTITY field (#51),
 REASON EDITED field (#53) and BAL FWD EDIT VERIFIED ORDER field (#54)
 of the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION file (#58.81).
  
 3. 119930  PSAPROC4   Multiple NDC match selection needs DUOU displayed
 PROBLEM
 ======= 
 When using the "Process Uploaded Prime Vendor Invoice Data" [PSA PROCESS
 PRIME VENDOR DATA] option, the user is presented with a list of drugs and
 related information if multiple synonyms exist. Currently the Dose Unit
 Order Unit (DUOU) is not displayed in that information.  The lack of this
 information can result in the wrong drug being selected during invoice
 processing.
  
 RESOLUTION
 ==========
 PSAPROC4 routine will be modified to include the DUOU in the synonym 
 information that is displayed.
  
 4. 191994  PSAVERA   Duplicate receipt issue
 PROBLEM
 =======
 When using the Edit Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] option to
 edit an invoice that has not been verified, the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY
 TRANSACTION file (#58.81) is updated.  Then when the user verifies the invoice
 the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION file (#58.81) is updated again causing
 duplicate transactions for the invoice item(s) that the edit was done on.
  
 RESOLUTION
 ==========
 PSAVERA routine will be modified to check the status of the invoice prior to 
 making any updates to the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION file (#58.81).
