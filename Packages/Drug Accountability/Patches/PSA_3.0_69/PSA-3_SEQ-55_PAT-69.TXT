Description:
============

 The FY08 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the following enhancement in the
 Drug Accountability V. 3.0 application.
     
 A new module is being added to the Drug Accountability application to address
 one of the findings in the GAO Report GAO-04-755 dated July 2004 related
 to implementing a better control over Return Drug Credits. The new module
 is called Return Drug Credit Menu and contains the following 4 options. 
   
     1      Batch Work List            [PSA RET DRG BATCH WORKLIST] 
     2      Batch Complete List        [PSA RET DRG BAT COMPLETE LIST]
     3      View/Update Batch          [PSA RET DRG VIEW/UPDATE BATCH] 
     4      Return Drug Credit Report  [PSA RET DRG REPORT] 
   
 The Batch Work List [PSA RET DRG BATCH WORKLIST] option will be used to
 process open return batches, which are assigned a status of either
 'AWAITING PICKUP' or 'PICKED UP'.
  
 The Batch Complete List [PSA RET DRG BAT COMPLETE LIST] option allows users
 to access and update batches with any status. 
  
 The View/Update Batch [PSA RET DRG VIEW/UPDATE BATCH] option is used for 
 single batch processing, independent of its status. 
  
 The Return Drug Credit Report [PSA RET DRG REPORT] option provides
 the users with summary and detailed reports of all return batches.
  
 Security Keys:
 -------------
 In order to have access to the new options, a user must have the PSORPH 
 or PSARET security key. The PSORPH key is an existing key in the 
 Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application. The PSARET key is a new security
 key in the Drug Accountability application that will be transported in
 this patch and should be assigned to users who will be responsible for
 returning drugs to the contractor.
  
 New Files:
 ---------
 The following two new files are being added to the Drug Accountability
 V. 3.0 application to support the functionality delivered by this patch.
  
  
                                 UP    SEND  DATA                USER
                                 DATE  SEC.  COMES   SITE  RSLV  OVER
 FILE #  FILE NAME               DD    CODE  W/FILE  DATA  PTRS  RIDE
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 58.35   RETURN DRUG             YES   YES   NO                  
 58.36   RETURN DRUG CONTRACTOR  YES   YES   NO 
  
   
 The RETURN DRUG file (#58.35) is used to store all the information
 about drugs being returned to the manufacturer while the RETURN DRUG 
 CONTRACTOR file (#58.36) is used to store the list of contractors
 that the VA Medical Center (VAMC) uses for returning drugs for credit.
 Most likely there will be only one contractor active at a time for most,
 if not all, VAMCs.
