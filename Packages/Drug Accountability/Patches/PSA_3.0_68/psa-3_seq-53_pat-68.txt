Subject: OUTDATED MEDICATIONS OPTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following problems:
  
 1.  The Outdated Medication [PSA OUTDATED MEDICATIONS] option, which
 allows for documentation of the return of non-controlled substances, uses
 the CS Destruction file (#58.86).  This file will not allow the user's
 name to be recorded in the PHARMACIST DESTROYED DRUG field (#9) if they 
 do not have the PSDMGR or PSJ RPHARM security key assigned.
  
 2.  The Items to Be Returned Report does not differentiate between 
 returned drug entries made for different divisions/sites.  Entries need 
 to be entered and listed by division.
  
 3. Drug accountability invoice processing is changing the NDC field from 
 numeric to alpha characters.
  
 4. The PRE Verify and POST Verify Variance Reports inaccurately report
 changes for supply items that have been entered with leading numerics in 
 the supply item name (i.e. 60 dram vials).
  
 5. The Outdated Medications [PSA OUTDATED MEDICATIONS] option does not
 display all possible matches for a drug if the DRUG file (#50) index "C"
 is a match to the information entered at the "Scan Drug barcode or enter a
 drug name" prompt.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1.  HD0000000180658 - Outdated Medications Option Not Working
  
     PROBLEM
     ------- 
     The problem occurs when a user that does not have the PSDMGR or PSJ 
     RPHARM security key attempts to return outdated medication back to
     manufacturer through the Outdated Medications [PSA OUTDATED
     MEDICATIONS] option. The issue will be resolved by bypassing the
     screen in the CS DESTRUCTION file (#58.86), PHARMACIST DESTROYED DRUG
     field (#9) when using this option.  It will now allow for the user's
     name to be filed for this field without having to assign additional
     security keys.
  
     RESOLUTION
     ----------
     Routine PSAOUT will be modified to record the user's name in the CS
     Destruction file (#58.86).  It will no longer look at the screen on
     the Pharmacist Destroyed Drug field (#9).  
  
  
 2.  HD0000000172859 - Outdated drug list for integrated sites
  
     PROBLEM
     ------- 
     The Items to Be Returned Report lists all entries under one division. 
  
     RESOLUTION
     ----------
     PSAOUT routine will be modified to display a list of available sites
     for selection of pharmacy location during drug entry in the Outdated
     Medications option.  This will allow for outdated medication to be
     entered under a particular pharmacy location.  The Items to be 
     Returned Report will now also be printed by pharmacy location, which
     will be displayed in the header.
  
  
 3.  HD0000000184524   NDC changed from numbers to letters
  
     PROBLEM
     -------
     When an invoice line item contains a null value for the NDC, the Drug
     Accountability application uses the VSN # to attempt to match to the 
     correct drug.  The .01 field of the drug's SYNONYM that contains the
     VSN # is then used to populate the NDC field for that synonym.  
     Synonyms created through the Drug Accountability application will have
     the NDC in the .01 field of the synonym.  There may exists some DA
     type synonyms that the site has entered manually that contain alpha
     characters in the .01 field.  This results in the NDC field populated
     with drug names, etc.
  
     RESOLUTION
     ----------
     Routine PSABRKU6  will be modified to check the SYNONYM field #.01 
     of the SYNONYM sub-file #50.1 of the DRUG file #50 for alpha numerics.
     If the value in that field is not all numeric, the NDC CODE field 2 of
     the SYNONYM sub-file will be checked against the NDC field #31 of the
     DRUG file #50 for a match.  If there is no match, the user will be
     forced to enter the correct NDC during invoice processing.
  
  
     HD0000000222558 - Supply item match to drug file
  
     PROBLEM
     -------
     When an invoice that contains supply items is processed and supply
     item names are entered that contain leading numerics (i.e. 60 dram 
     vials), the PRE Verify and POST Verify Variance reports reference the
     leading number as a drug IEN and incorrectly display the NDC from the
     corresponding drug file entry as the "OLD NDC" on the PRE and POST
     Verify reports.
  
     RESOLUTION
     ----------
     PSAPROC7 routine will be modified to not create the PRE Verify or the
     POST Verify Variance Reports when a supply item name begins a number.
  
  
 5.  HD0000000229658 - Outdated Medications
  
     PROBLEM
     -------
     The Outdated Medications [PSA OUTDATED MEDICATIONS] option does not
     display all possible matches for a drug if the DRUG file #50 index "C"
     is a match to the information entered at the "Scan Drug barcode or
     enter a drug name" prompt.
  
     RESOLUTION
     ----------
     Routine PSAOUT will be modified to look up any drug that may have
     multiple entries in the "NDC" and "C" indexes of the DRUG file #50. 
     It will also allow users to look up a drug with a partial drug name.
