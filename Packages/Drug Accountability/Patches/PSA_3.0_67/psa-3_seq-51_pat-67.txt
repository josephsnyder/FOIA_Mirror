Description:
============

 This patch modifies the screens within the processing and verification
 processes within Drug Accountability. Additional drug information is
 now being included in the invoice files received from the prime vendor.
  
 The additional fields are:
 Generic Description            displayed as PV-Drug-Generic Name
 Item Description               displayed as PV-Drug-Description
 Prime Vendor Units             displayed as PV-Units
 Inner Pack                     displayed as PV-DUOU  
  
 The following is a list of the fields added to the 
 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY ORDER (#58.811). These fields are
 included in this patch:
  
 Field Name                    Sub-file Number (Field Number)
 -------------------           ------------------------------
 GENERIC DESCRIPTION           58.81125           (18)
 ITEM DESCRIPTION              58.81125           (19)
 PRIME VENDOR UNITS            58.81125           (20)
 INNER PACK                    58.81125           (21)
  
 Currently, the Item Description and the inner pack fields are stored in
 a temporary global which was setup in patch PSA*3*54. This global is no
 longer used. The addition of the four fields is intended to assist the
 user with the matching of incoming invoice items to the Drug (#50) file.
 Below is an example of what the screens look like prior to installation
 of this patch.
