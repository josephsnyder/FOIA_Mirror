Subject: ePharmacy Enhancements II

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*65
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*131
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*289
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*384
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*7
  
 The last three patches (PSO*7*289, IB*2*384 and BPS*1*7) will be released 
 in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 3.0.  Patches PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 will 
 be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an implementation 
 dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches, PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 must be installed prior to the 
 installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions please 
 refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 This patch modifies the CMOP v2.0 application as described
 below:
  
  
  1. When the CMOP transmission starts, all prescriptions in suspense are 
     evaluated to see if they should be submitted to ECME first and if so
     are submitted.  This is done to allow ECME enough time to process
     third party claim submissions prior to sending the prescriptions to
     CMOP so that any third party rejections may be properly evaluated.  
     Next the system re-evaluates suspended prescriptions to pull the
     latest list of fills to be sent to CMOP.  Between the time that the
     ePharmacy submissions are made and the CMOP batch is built, subsequent
     prescriptions are filled and have not been submitted to ECME.  These
     "in between" prescriptions were not being submitted for 3rd party
     claims.  A code change was made to make ECME submissions for these
     prescriptions.    
  
  2. New functionality was added to prevent prescriptions from being 
     filled/sent to CMOP when a host processing error occurs when a claim
     is submitted through ECME. The host processing errors are identified
     by reject codes M6, M8, NN, and 99. The following conditions apply
     when this scenario occurs.
      a. The transmission of the Rx/fill will be delayed 1 day in hopes
         that the host processing issues will be resolved.
      b. An activity log entry will be defined to state the date/time along
         with a comment stating that the Rx/fill was left in suspense hold 
         due to a host processing error.
      c. This added functionality does not include the Pull Early from
         Suspense function.
  
      NOTE:  There is a known issue where the system may not automatically 
      resubmit all claims rejected due to a host processing error.  A test 
      facility found where the software did not resubmit an electronic
      pharmacy claim automatically when a claim rejected for a host
      processing error.  The following day the prescription was transmitted
      to CMOP as anticipated and was filled.   The claim did appear on  the
      ECME User Screen so it could be manually resubmitted, which is the
      process facilities followed before this patch was installed.  Based
      upon analysis, this is an infrequent scenario (less than 1%) and will
      only occur in a particular set of circumstances.   This issue will be
      fixed in the next ePharmacy patch release.
  
  3. New functionality was added to the Print from Suspense File [PSO 
     PNDLBL] option to prevent ePharmacy prescriptions from being 
     printed from suspense or transmitted to CMOP until 3/4 of the days
     supply of the Rx/fill has elapsed. These prescriptions will be placed 
     in a Suspense Hold status until the hold date is reached.  
     Prescriptions in a Suspense Hold status can still be manually pulled
     early from suspense.
  
  
  4. The 'CMOP/ECME Activity Report' [BPS RPT CMOP/ECME ACTIVITY] has been
     modified. 
      a. The CMOP-STATUS column will display 'D' for Dispensed or 'T' for
         Transmitted instead of partially spelling out the status.
      b. A prompt will be added to select detailed or summary 
         information.  Detailed information will reflect what is currently 
         displayed. Summary information will shorten the batch header
         section of the report.
      c. A prompt will be added to select a list of patients (or ^ALL).
         Only patients on the list will be included in the detail.
      d. The division prompt will be modified to be consistent with other
         ECME options, i.e., the selection prompt will show 'A ALL
         DIVISIONS' first, 'S SELECT DIVISIONS' second, and will roll into
         particular divisions if the user selects an 'S'.
      e. A prompt will be added to select released, unreleased, or all
         prescriptions.
      f. Summary reports will only display information from batches that
         have ECME Rxs.
      g. Header information will be centered.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
      specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation 
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.

 for the multi-build distribution can be found under patch PSO*7*289 
 install instructions section.
  
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
 take less than 2 minutes. There should be no transmissions being processed
 during the installation.  This patch may be queued as long as no CMOP 
 transmissions are processed at and during the time of install.
