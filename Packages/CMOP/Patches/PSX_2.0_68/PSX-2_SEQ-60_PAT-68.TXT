Subject: FY09-Q3 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the FY09-Q3 Enhancement release and must be 
 installed along with Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 patch PSO*7*324, which 
 addresses PSI-07-181 (PSPO# 865) - Remedy Ticket # HD208961. A new mail 
 group named PSX EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS is created in this patch to
 support the functionality provided by patch PSO*7*324. 
  
 When a Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescription (Rx) with
 a status of Transmitted or Retransmitted is discontinued by a background
 job other than Outpatient Pharmacy options, e.g. Computerized Patient 
 Record System V. 1.0 (CPRS) or Registration V. 5.3 packages, then an 
 email notifying that a prescription was just discontinued for that Rx 
 will be sent to the new PSX EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS mail group. If no 
 recipients are defined in the new mail group, then the email alert will be
 sent to PSXCMOPMGR key holders. The email alert will inform the group that
 the CMOP status for the Rx just discontinued was either Transmitted or
 Retransmitted as seen in the example below.
