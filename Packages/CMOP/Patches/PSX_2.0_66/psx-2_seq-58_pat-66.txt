Associated patches: (v)PSX*2*58    <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSX*2*66'

Subject: ePharmacy Tricare Support Framework

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is one of four patches that enhance ePharmacy software to 
 provide the framework to support Tricare and Active Duty outpatient
 pharmacy billing.  The Tricare/Active Duty portions of this software
 enhancement will not be active until a future patch is released.  The
 release of the additional patch is pending Chief Business Office (CBO)
 contracting with the Tricare Fiscal Intermediary.
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along 
 with their associated patch number:
  
        APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
      --------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*66
  2.  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*287
  3.  ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*6
  4.  INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*383
  
 All four patches are being released separately with a requirement that 
 they be installed in the order outlined above.  
  
 It is important that all four patches be installed completely one right 
 after the other. If they are not, you may see errors occur during the
 Outpatient prescription entry process.
  
 There are no other dependencies between these patches, except that
 Tricare/Active Duty billing will not be supported by ePharmacy until all 4
 patches are installed.
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they 
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the CBO or are providing outpatient
 pharmacy services to Tricare or Active Duty patients.  After the
 installation of these patches, the activation status of the site will not
 be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy product will require
 instructions provided by the CBO, and sites are not to activate ePharmacy
 unless instructed specifically by the CBO.  Also, sites should not start
 to provide outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare patients without
 discussions with the CBO.
  
 This patch modifies the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy v2.0
 application.  The modifications are labeled dormant in the software and
 will remain inactive until the future Tricare patch is released.
  
 1.  (Dormant) - For Tricare prescriptions, CMOP background processing was
 modified to retain prescriptions in suspense when the third party claim
 remains in an ECME 'IN PROGESS' status or when it is flagged as
 non-billable. These prescriptions will be listed on the existing MailMan
 message with a subject line of 'ePharmacy - CMOP Not TRANSMITTED Rx List'.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
