Subject: FIX FOR BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR, HOST ERRORS, HOLD IN SUSPENSE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the CMOP v2.0 application as described below:
  
 - A correction was made to only allow an Rx to be evaluated for 
   ECME claim submission if a Bad Address indicator is not present.
  
 - Electronic pharmacy claims rejected for host processing errors will be
   automatically resubmitted for processing.
  
 - Rejected Tricare prescriptions will be held in suspense until the 
   cause of the rejection has been corrected.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. H0000000D365471 - ECME Activity Log Entry for each claims evaluation
  
    PROBLEM:
    --------
    An entry was being added to the ECME LOG every time an Rx is evaluated
    for ECME claim submissions and the Rx was flagged for Bad Address.
  
    RESOLUTION:
    -----------
    A modification was made to only allow the Rx to be evaluated for ECME
    claim submission if a Bad Address indicator is not present.
  
  
 2. HD0000000365473 - CMOP ePharmacy claims with host processing errors not
                      automatically being submitted
  
    PROBLEM:
    --------
    There is a known issue where the system may not automatically resubmit
    all claims rejected due to a host processing error. Based upon
    analysis, this is an infrequent scenario (less than 1%) and will only
    occur in a particular set of circumstances.
    
    A test facility found where the software did not resubmit an electronic
    pharmacy claim automatically when a claim rejected for a host
    processing error. The following day the prescription was transmitted to
    CMOP as anticipated and was filled. The claim did appear on the ECME
    User Screen so it could be manually resubmitted, which is the process
    facilities followed before this patch was installed.
  
    Host processing errors are identified by reject codes M6, M8, NN, & 99.
    The following conditions apply when this scenario occurs.
  
      a. The transmission of the Rx/fill will be delayed 1 day in hopes
         that the host processing issues will be resolved.
      b. An activity log entry will be made indicating the date/time along
         with a comment stating that the Rx/fill was left in suspense hold 
         due to a host processing error.
      c. This added functionality does not include the Pull Early from
         Suspense function.
  
    RESOLUTION: 
    -----------
    Electronic pharmacy claims rejected for host processing errors will be
    automatically resubmitted for processing.
  
  
 3. HD0000000365474 - Software is allowing rejected TRICARE Rxs to be sent
                      to CMOP for filling
  
    PROBLEM:
    --------
    The system was allowing rejected Tricare prescriptions to be sent to
    CMOP.  Tricare rejected prescriptions should be held in suspense until 
    the reject reason has been resolved.
  
    RESOLUTION:
    ----------- 
    Rejected Tricare prescriptions will be held in suspense until the
    cause of the rejection has been corrected.
