Subject: WARNING LABELS TO CMOP

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Currently in backdoor Pharmacy, all warning labels are printed.
 However, when Prescription Warning labels are transmitted to the
 Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), there is a limit of 5
 warnings per prescription. CMOP has requested that all warning labels be
 sent with every prescription. This patch therefore allows more than five
 warnings per prescription to be transmitted to CMOP, and also allows
 warning text that is greater than 220 characters per warning.
  
 Prescription Warning labels are currently transmitted to CMOP via Health 
 Level Seven (HL7) messages in segment NTE|11|, with a limit of 220 
 characters. This patch creates a continuation segment in NTE|11A| to 
 contain the warning text that is greater than the initial 220 characters, 
 up to an additional 220 characters. The continuation segment immediately 
 follows the NTE|11| segment of the warning. This means all warning labels 
 will be transmitted to CMOP.
