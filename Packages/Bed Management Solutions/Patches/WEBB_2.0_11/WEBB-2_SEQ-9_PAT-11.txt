 Description:
 ===========
   
  The Bed Management Solution(BMS)v2.4 software enhancement project is to
  comply with 508 requirements and improve usability of the BMS system,
  which improves the data accessibility and usability for the BMS v2 users,
  and increase the integration of the BMSv2 and VA systems.
   
  Patch Components:                            
  ----------------- 
 The following enhancements are included in this release: 
   
  1. Address 508 compliance issues 
   
  2. Reporting Enhancements:
     New Reports:
   - Average Discharge Time: This report is used to calculate the
     average time between discharge order and the time of discharge.
     This report is sortable by source and is similar to the 
     patient movement file report.
   - Discharge Tracking Report: This report allows users to capture/monitor
     the amount of time between the signing of the order and the actual 
     discharge event occurring.    
   - Census Calculations: This report displays facility census by bed type-
     Acute Inpatient, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Acute Mental Health,
     Domiciliary (DOM), CLC, and Others.
   - Evacuation Status: This report is to identify disposition status during 
     evacuation mode that will display on the whiteboard
   - Patient Transfer Report: This report lists patients transferred
     and the facility or ward from which the patient was transferred
     during an evacuation event.
    
    Modified Reports:
   - Contracted care report on BMS Report Pick List:  
     This report displays all the elements of the Contract section without
     data on other patients. This is on the VISN page of BMS. 
     It is under the VISN Patients Pending Bed Placement reports 
     and was modified to add a Fee Basis section to the VISN PPBP and to 
     provide a field to display on the VISN and National PPBP the name
     of the person who is the point of contact for the transfer.
   - Emergency Management Regulating Report : This report includes the 
     total number of patients for each type of emergency icon.
     This report has been added to VISN home page .
   - Emergency Management Vehicle Manifest : This report includes data from
     VistA for: the originating facility name, address, point of contact
     name(s) and telephone number(s).
     This report has been added to VISN home page.
   
   - All Reports were standardized to show duration in hours and minutes. 
   
   - Access to the reports server for VHA report analysts
     to develop custom queries and reports to be used
     by the BMS user community. 
     
  3. Patients Pending Bed Placement (PPBP)-Custom layouts are
     available for each view and all PPBP reports are exportable.
     Each view at the facility level has been modified to include
     additional patient related elements.
   
  4. Dashboard view:
   - On the facility home page for displaying real-time facility information 
     (i.e. BMS ward group census, system status, new event summary,
     diversion type/duration, and other capacity information). BMS
     users at all levels will be able to access current capacities and
     capabilities at a glance in one common, central location to improve
     their ability to make timely decisions.
   - On the BMS Facility Site Options: On the Facility level Admin page the
     Bed Board Module Enable/Disable has been removed from BMS.
     
  5. Icons:
   - Patient care icons will automatically display based on orders entered
     into CPRS (e.g. telemetry and PICC).
   - The icon stays with the patient until a patient movement occurs or
     the order is discontinued.
   - Icon for Methicillin-Resistant Aureus (MRSA) and the ability to create
     icons for other infectious diseases as they are identified have been
     added.
   - These icons shall perform isolation-type Environmental Management
     Services (EMS) notifications upon discharge of the patient
   - Patient Opt Out: An icon is displayed on the BMS presentation layer
     pages when the Opt Out of Hospital Directory field has been activated.
   - Automatic Icon: BMS provides specific Orderable Item (OI) 
     and precise instructions for the CAC's to follow. Where appropriate, 
     this ability will eliminate the need for BMS users to 
     manually determine the need for addition or removal of icons.
   - On the Site Configurable Icon page BMS was enhanced to display
     a warning to users:
      "Warning: Do Not create icons to communicate patient's 
      Life Sustaining Treatment orders (i.e. DNR, DNAR, DNI,
      Do Not Attempt Resuscitation, or similar). Reference CPRS/VistA
      directly for this information, as BMS does not currently support
      communication of the Life Sustainment Treatment Order Set.
      Using BMS to manually indicate patient end of life wishes could
      result in a catastrophic patient safety event."
    
  6. WhiteBoard Treating Specialty Display:
   - For BMS Administrator - adding a parameter on the 
     VistA Ward Add/Edit page under Site Options
     to allow the user to configure each ward to determine if the treating
     specialty would be displayed, to limit the personal health 
     information that is displayed in public areas.
   - For BMS Administrators, this option will allow the user to determine
     the mode where the display restriction would be applied, e.g., 
     apply the restriction to Kiosk mode but not to the desktop mode.
   
  7. Observation (OBS) countdown : Display on the Whiteboard a countdown
     for a patient in observation status (the number of hours a patient
     has left in observation status).
   
  8. Diversion Categories and Display:
   - Allow diversion to be indicated by treating specialty or BMS ward
     group.
   - Display the units that are on diversion.
   - There is a pop-up on diversion that would show the type of diversion.
   - The VISN Page displays a diversion icon to appear if the facility
     is on diversions.
   - Display Diversion Status on VISN Page: There is a "Mouse Over" or
     "Hover" capability that is the same as the facility diversion
     hover capability.
   - Diversion is displayed on the Bed Summary Report, along with what
     kind of diversion (Psych, ED, etc.) using the same icons as used
     elsewhere.
   - Diversion report on the home page under reports- This report tracks
     diversions by instances and number of hours and by type of 
     diversion for a user specified time period.
      It includes a header and is available at the facility and VISN level.
      This report can be exported to Excel.
   - Diversion display includes a comments field to describe the 
     diversion.
   - An Excel file can be populated with data from the displayed
     Diversion Report.
     
  9. Functionality for Patients Pending Bed Placement(PPBP):
   - National PPBP Adding Patients: Changed BMS so that when a user
     indicates that the patient should be added to the National PPBP
     the system will ask the user to confirm that the patient should
     be added to the National PPBP. This is to validate the need of 
     the patient to be placed on the National PPBP and with confirmation,
     to send email notice to the VHA BMS National Patient Placement Alert.
   - Updated BMS to provide the ability for the user to 
     indicate if the patient on the PPBP is in a 
     community hospital and be able to sort and identify those PT 
     receiving care outside of the VA (i.e. Fee). 
   - Updated BMS to provide the ability to promote a patient from
     the VISN PPBP to the National PPBP- For System Administrators
     to provide the ability to finalize a patient from the National
     PPBP to any VISN PPBP.
   - In-house transfer: BMS will, when configured, automatically add
     patients to the PPBP when a transfer order is created and
     retrieve required data elements from VistA.
   - Provided a "Today-1/Today+1" button to the Current/Past filtering
     with the PPBP header section.
  
  10. Enhancements
   - System performance/reliability. Moved reporting to a dedicated
     server.
   - Improve speed of BMS whiteboard. Whiteboard was reworked
     to improve system efficiency.
   - Finalize/promote patient transfers from the facility, VISN, or 
     national levels. Allows movement of patients without individually
     re-entering information.
   - Add/Edit User: the following was changed for the options:
     - The domain of the user can be retained. domain defaults for user
     - The add user and remove selected on the Facility Settings screen 
       is enabled.
     - User management allows searching for user by given
       name in addition to system name.
     - The system accommodates adding multiple users to 
       a role in one transaction.
     - BMS updated so that System Administrators can assign 
       national read access (for EM evacuation and access).
     - BMS can now limited write access to whiteboard 
       for any role when assigning accesses. 
   - Facility Setting: - admin section - group wards
   - Background Processors - Audit: System Administrators can now
     click a VISN or region and include all facilities in 
     the VISN or Region.
   - BMS will allow for creation of virtual wards Patients waiting
     to be admitted. There is now the ability to create wards
     that would be used only in BMS and would not be dependent on
     patient movements in VistA.
   - BMS will record the ID of users performing create, 
     update, and delete actions on the PPBP List and the Whiteboard.
     This information will be available on the PPBP
     and Whiteboard Modification Audit Report.
   - Application Parameters Page. A page was created to allow national 
     support users to control hyperlinks for clinical inventory and 
     national placement email. 
   
  11. National Utilization Management Integration(NUMI), 
      Emergency Department Integrated System(EDIS), VistA Data Exchange,
      and Emergency Management System(EMS)
   - NUMI Numbering Feature: Change the display of the NUMI Numbers. The
     top number should be the number of days at the current status.  The
     bottom number should be the number of days since the last review.
   - ED Patient Interface: When the disposition in the EDIS changes to
     admit (changes to Flag =VA Admit), the patient is automatically 
     added to the PPBP. 
     (Cancelled Scheduled Admissions: When a scheduled admission is
      cancelled in VistA, the patient does not appear on the PPBP).
   - Emergency Management Patient Roster: Each vehicle's roster provides
     clinicians with details on each patient.
   - Emergency Management VISN Page: Emergency Management reports are 
     available from the VISN page for patients pushed there.
   - EMS Module Activation by Ward: Facility Administrators and 
     EMS Users can configure EMS Module to be activated by Ward. Users 
     need the ability to customize the use of the BMS Modules at the 
     local level.
   - EMS Dispatcher Role: A new role of EMS Dispatcher is available 
     that has more privileges, i.e., being able to look at the whiteboards
     to plan for demand based on anticipated discharges.
   - The EMS User Add Edit page, link, and/or control is relabeled to in
     indicate the functionality applies to portal access control.
