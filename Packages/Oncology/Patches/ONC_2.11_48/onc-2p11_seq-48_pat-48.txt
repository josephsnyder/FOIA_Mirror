Subject: NPI/CS 01.04.01/NAACCR 11.2 Implementation

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 NOTE: The new SACC standard allows for variable lengths longer than 8
       characters. However, the TOOLKIT patch (XT*7.3*110) which updates XINDEX
       to reflect the new standards has not been released yet.  Please ignore
       the following XINDEX warnings.
 
 *****   ERRORS & WARNINGS IN ONCOCOM   *****
 
    MONTHYEAR    W - Invalid local variable name.
    MONTHYEAR    S - Lower/Mixed case Variable name used.
 
 This patch will do the following:
 
  1) NATIONAL PROVIDER IDENTIFIER (NPI) FOR INSTITUTIONS
 
     This patch will implement the 10-digit NPI codes for the 136 Vista
     facilities which support an ONCOTRAX Tumor Registry.  (NPI codes for
     physicians and other institutions will be addressed in a subsequent patch.)
 
     A new data item, NPI (160.19,101), has been created in the FACILITY 
     (160.19) file to store the NPI number.  This data item comes pre-loaded in
     this patch with the 136 NPI numbers needed by ONCOTRAX. 
     
     The NPI implementation will be transparent to the registrar.  When the data
     is exported to the NCDB, State Registry or VACCR, the following NAACCR data
     items will now contain the appropriate NPI code.
 
       NPI--Registry ID         [45]   40-49
       NPI--Reporting Facility  [545]  372-381
       NPI--Archive FIN         [3105] 447-456
 
     The NPI for a facility may be added or edited via the [Enter/Edit Facility
     file] option which can be found on the [*..Utility Options ...] menu.
 
     In addition to the above, the following new entries have been added to the
     FACILITY file:
 
     10000739 NORTH CHICAGO VA MEDICAL CENTER
     10000742 VA SOUTHERN OREGON REHABILITATION CENTER & CLINICS
 
  2) COLLABORATIVE STAGING VERSION 01.04.01
 
     a) This patch updates the [CS Restage CS cases using latest version]
     option.  This option will search for 2004+ cases which have been previously
     staged with an earlier version of the CS algorithm and restage them
     using CS Version 01.04.01.  Upon installation of this patch please run the
     [CS Restage CS cases using the latest version] option to bring your 2004+
     cases up to date.
 
     Cases which encounter CS errors or warnings during restaging will
     display an error message identifying the problem case by PID, PRIMARY
     SITE and ACCESSION/SEQUENCE NUMBER.
   
     e.g. B0036  C32.1  200600004/02 encountered a CS warning
 
     These cases should be reviewed and restaged manually.
 
     NOTE: The [CS Restage CS cases using latest version] option has been
     enhanced so that future versions of CS will not need the release a new
     ONCOTRAX patch.  In the future, as soon as a new CS version has been
     installed on the CS server, the registrars may use this option to re-stage
     old cases.
  
     b) In addition to the above restaging functionality, this patch will
     perform the following CS v01.04.01 data conversions as per the
     "CS V01.04.00 Detailed Guidelines for Recording/Conversion of Existing
     Data" document. 
 
     NOTE: The following logic only applies to cases which do NOT have a
     histology value of 9140 or 9590-9699 or 9702-9989:
     
     [Hypopharynx]
     For C12.9 and C13. cases
       if EXTENSION (CS) = 51,
       then EXTENSION (CS) has been converted to 45
 
     [Breast]
     For C50. cases
       if LYMPH NODES (CS) = 28 and
          REG NODES EVAL (CS) = 2 or 3 or 6 or 8 or null and
          SITE-SPECIFIC FACTOR 3 (CS) is between 004 and 009,
       then LYMPH NODES (CS) has been converted to 30
 
       if LYMPH NODES (CS) = 50 and
          REG NODES EVAL (CS) = 2 or 3 or 6 or 8 or null,
          SITE-SPECIFIC FACTOR 3 (CS) is between 004 and 090,
       then LYMPH NODES (CS) has been converted to 52
 
     [Fallopian Tube]
     For C57.0 cases
       if EXTENSION (CS) = 70,
       then EXTENSION (CS) has been converted to 68
 
       if EXTENSION (CS) = 71,
       then EXTENSION (CS) has been converted to 66
     
     c) Colon (C18.0-C18.9) and Rectosigmoid, Rectum (C19.9, C20.9) now have
     a Site-Specific Factor 2 of "Clinical Assessment of Regional Lymph Nodes".
     The 888 (Not applicable) stuffing of SITE-SPECIFIC FACTOR 2 (CS)
     (165.5,44.2) has been removed.
 
     d) A new data item, CS VERSION FIRST (165.5,169.1), has been added.  This
     item indicates the CS version used to initially stage a case.
     The data item CS VERSION (165.5,169) has been renamed CS VERSION LATEST.
     This item indicates the CS version most recently used to derive the CS
     output fields.      
 
  3) NAACCR Record Layout Version 11.2
 
     This patch implements NAACCR Record Layout Version 11.2.  There are no
     significant changes from version 11.1.
 
     Changes from version 11.1:
 
       CensusBlockGroup         [368]  235-235 (New item)
       Reserved 02              [530]  236-280 (Revised, shortened)
       Number of Tumors/Hist    [447]  345-346 (Retired item)
       Reserved 03              [680]  345-371 (Revised, expanded)
       RX Summ--Reconstruct 1st [1330] 867-867 (Added Default of 9)
  
 In addition to implementing NPI codes, CS v01.04.01 and NAACCR Record Layout
 v11.2, this patch contains the following problem resolutions:
 
  4) [*..Utility Options ...]
      [Create State/VACCR Data Download]
 
     The "End, Date Case Completed" and "End, Date Case Last Changed" values
     will now be retained for use as the default "End" values for the next use
     of this option.
 
  5) [*..Utility Options ...]
      [Create ACOS Data Download]
 
     The [Create ACOS Data Download] option has been enhanced.  The registrar 
     may now extract the data within a specified DATE CASE LAST CHANGED date
     range.  This enhancement will enable the registrar to extract and re-submit
     'fixed' cases to the NCDB (National Cancer Data Base) without having to
     re-submit the entire Accession Year. 
 
     Upon specifying the Accession Year, the registrar will be asked to select
     from the following extract options:
 
       Select one of the following:
 
            1 All eligible cases for this year
            2 Cases within a 'Date Case Last Changed' date range
 
     If the registrar selects item 1, the program will extract all eligible 
     cases for the specified Accession Year.
 
     If the registrar selects item 2, the program will prompt for a 'Start' and
     'End' Date Case Last Changed date range for the specified Accession Year.
 
  6) LATERALITY (165.5,28) for LYMPH NODES, HEAD & NECK (C77.0)
 
     LYMPH NODES, HEAD & NECK (C77.0) was incorrectly flagged as a 'Paired Organ
     Site'.  This flag has been removed.
 
  7) EDITS display
 
     When an abstract has successfully passed through EDITS, the display
     following the EDITS call has been enhanced to include DATE OF FIRST CONTACT 
     (165.5,155) and a new data item, ELAPSED MONTHS TO COMPLETION (165.5,157.1).
     The post-EDITS display will now look as follows: 
 
     Calling EDITS API...
     No EDITS errors or warnings.
 
     ABSTRACT STATUS.............: Complete
     DATE OF FIRST CONTACT.......: 03/09/2007  <--new
     DATE CASE COMPLETED.........: 05/22/2007
     ELAPSED MONTHS TO COMPLETION: 2           <--new
     ABSTRACTED BY...............: REGISTRAR,TEST
     DATE CASE LAST CHANGED......: 06/26/2007
     CASE LAST CHANGED BY........: REGISTRAR,TEST
 
  8) [Timeliness Report]
 
     The [Timeliness Report] option has been modified in the following ways:
 
     1) The registrar will now be asked to select a "Date of First Contact" date
        range.  Previously, the registrar was asked to select a "Date Case
        Completed" date range.
 
     2) The [Timeliness Report] option now has an additional input prompt:
        "Analytic cases only? YES//".
        If the default response of YES is accepted, the report will only count
        analytic cases: CLASS OF CASE (0-2).  If the user responds NO, both
        analytic and non-analytic cases will be counted.
 
        NOTE: 99/99/9999 is an acceptable value for DATE OF FIRST CONTACT.
        Cases with a 99/99/9999 DATE OF FIRST CONTACT value will not be counted
        in the Timeliness Report.
   
     3) Timeliness will be now be based on ELAPSED MONTHS TO COMPLETION
        (165.5,157.1).  It was previously based on ELAPSED DAYS TO COMPLETION
        (165.5,157).  The TIMELINESS REPORT will now display as follows:
 
        TIMELINESS REPORT
 
        Start Date of First Contact......: 
        End Date of First Contact........: 
        Division.........................: 
        Analytic cases only..............:
        Cases Completed within six months:
        Cases Completed > six months.....:
        Percentage of cases compliant....:
