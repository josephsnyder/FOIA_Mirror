Description:
============

 This patch will do the following:
 
  1) National Provider Identifier (NPI) codes
 
     The following ONCOTRAX fields are required to be associated with an NPI
     code for all 2007+ cases:
 
     Individual Provider fields 
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PRIMARY SURGEON     field (#2)   in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) 
     FOLLOWING PHYSICIAN field (#2.1) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     MANAGING PHYSICIAN  field (#2.2) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     PHYSICIAN #3        field (#2.3) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     PHYSICIAN #4        field (#2.4) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     Organizational Providers fields
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     FACILITY ID #          field (#27)  in the ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETERS file
                                         (#160.1)
     REPORTING FACILITY     field (#.03) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     FACILITY REFERRED FROM field (#6)   in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     FACILITY REFERRED TO   field (#7)   in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     FOLLOWING REGISTRY sub-field (#10)  within the FOLLOW-UP multiple (#400)
                                         in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160)
 
     NPI codes for individual providers are stored in the NPI field (#101) in
     the ONCOLOGY CONTACT file (#165).
     NPI codes for organizational providers are stored in the NPI field (#101)
     in the FACILITY file (#160.19).
 
     Upon entering the above fields, the program will check if an NPI code
     has already been associated with this provider.  If no NPI code is found,
     the program will prompt the registrar to enter the NPI code.
 
     For example,
 
     MANAGING PHYSICIAN: WELBY,MARCUS// 
 
     This provider needs to be associated with
     an NPI (National Provider Identifier) code.
 
     Select method of NPI entry: ?
 
     Enter a code from the list.
 
      Select one of the following:
 
           1         Get NPI from NEW PERSON file
           2         Enter NPI code manually
 
     Select method of NPI entry: 1  Get NPI from NEW PERSON file
     Select PROVIDER: WELBY,MARCUS
     Is this the correct provider? Y//
 
     NPI code 1231231238 has been added for WELBY,MARCUS.
 
     Once a provider has been associated with an NPI code, the NPI dialog will
     no longer appear for that provider.
 
  2) Print Abstract NOT Complete List [ONCO ABSTRACT-NOT COMPLETE]
 
     The PRIMARY ABSTRACT NOT-COMPLETE Report has been redesigned.  It now
     looks as follows:
 
 PRIMARY ABSTRACT NOT-COMPLETE Report           FEB 12,2009  08:57    PAGE 1
                                                                      DATE OF
                         ACC/SEQ                                      FIRST
 PID#   PATIENT NAME     NUMBER         SITE/GP        CC DATE DX     CONTACT
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                         ABSTRACT STATUS: Incomplete
 W5555  WTEST,WWWWW      2008-00006/01  BLADDER        0  04/30/2008  04/21/2008
 T2222  TTEST,TTTTT      2008-00001/01  BRAIN          0  05/02/2008  
 R8788  RTEST,RRRRR      2008-00004/02  PROSTATE       1  07/24/2008  07/01/2008
 
  3) TNM FORM ASSIGNED  field (#25) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file
     TNM FORM COMPLETED field (#44) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file            
 
     For Lymphoid Neoplasms the fields TNM FORM ASSIGNED and TNM FORM
     COMPLETED were being stuffed with 00/00/0000 if blank.  This was incorrect.
     TNM FORM ASSIGNED and TNM FORM COMPLETED will no longer be stuffed for
     Lymphoid Neoplasms.
 
  4) *..Utility Options ... [ONCO UTIL MENU]
     Compute percentage of TNM forms completed [ONC TNM FORMS COMPLETE %]
 
     The "Compute percentage of TNM forms completed" option has been enhanced
     to include a list of the abstracts which have been assigned but not
     completed.
 
  5) *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
     Print QA/Multiple Abstracts [ONCO ABSTRACT-MULTIPLE]
     All abstracts, One or more ACCESSION YEAR(s), One SITE/GP
 
     The "All abstracts, One ACCESSION YEAR, One SITE/GP" option has been
     enhanced to allow for the selection of an ACCESSION YEAR range.  Upon
     selecting this option the registrar will now be asked to select an
     ACCESSION YEAR time frame of "All years", "Range of years" or "Particular
     year".
 
  6) STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC (#87) computation using CLINICAL M (#37.3) instead
     of PATHOLOGIC M (#87)
     All of the above fields reside within the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5).
 
     In patch ONC*2.11*47 we implemented the following STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC
     automatic staging rule:
 
     "For computing pathologic stage, use pT and pN.  Then, if pM is 1, 1A, 1B,
     1C, or 1M use it; otherwise use the value of cM (whether it is blank, cMX,
     cM0, cM1, cM1a, cM1b, cM1c or 88) to calculate pathologic stage group."
 
     The application of this rule is inappropriate if both pT and pN have a
     value of "X".
     
     The automatic pathologic stage grouping logic has been adjusted
     accordingly.  The "use cM for pathologic stage group" rule will be ignored
     if pT and pN both equal "X".
  
     Inquiry & Response System (I&R) ID: 22656
 
  7) "Shared" cases at multidivisional facilities
 
     Multidivisional facilities may have the need to "share" cases, i.e.
     maintain separate primary records for the same case.  For example, a case
     may be diagnosed and partially treated at Division A (Class of Case 1) and
     then receive additional treatment at Division B (Class of Case 2).
     
     A check has been added which will detect "shared" cases and display the
     following NOTE if encountered:
 
     NOTE: This patient has more than one primary with the same
           SEQUENCE NUMBER and PRIMARY SITE.  These primaries
           belong to different divisions.  You may wish to notify
           the other division of any significant changes for this patient.
 
    This NOTE will facilitate inter-divisional communication regarding "shared"
    cases.
   
   8) DRE +/- field (#102) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     The code descriptions for DRE +/- have been modified.
 
     Old code descriptions:
 
        0  Negative
        1  Positive
        9  Not done/not recorded in chart
 
     New code descriptions:
 
        0  Clinically normal
        1  Clinically abnormal
        9  Not done/not documented
 
     Also, the help text has been modified to include the SEER EXTENT OF DISEASE
     -- 1998 CODES AND CODING INSTRUCTIONS list of terms to distinguish apparent
     from inapparent tumor in the prostate.
 
  9) OTHER STAGING SYSTEM field (#39) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     The following OTHER STAGING SYSTEM codes were inadvertently omitted from
     patch ONC*2.11*47.  They have been added:
 
     DS1       FABL1
     DS1A      FABL2
     DS1B      FABL3
     DS2       FABM0
     DS2A      FABM1
     DS2B      FABM2
     DS3       FABM3
     DS3A      FABM4
     DS3B      FABM4E
               FABM5A
               FABM5B
               FABM6
               FABM7
 
 10) PERFORMANCE STATUS AT DX field (#227) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     A new field, PERFORMANCE STATUS AT DX, has been added to the ONCOLOGY
     PRIMARY file.  This field has been added to the "Stage of Disease at
     Diagnosis" portion of the abstract.  This field will accept a numeric value
     in the range 0-3.
 
     This field records an attempt to quantify the patient's general
     well-being.
          
     Score 0:  Asymptomatic and fully active (ECOG 0; KPS or LPS 100%)
          
     Score 1:  Symptomatic, fully ambulatory, and restricted only in
               physically strenuous activity (ECOG 1, KPS or LPS 80-90%)
      
     Score 2:  Symptomatic, ambulatory, capable of self care, >50% of
               waking hours out of bed (ECOG 2, KPS or LPS 60-70%)
          
     Score 3:  Symptomatic, limited self care, >50% of waking hours in
               bed (ECOG 3-4, KPS or LPS <60%)
 
     This field has been placed in VA Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) data
     extract in column position 1528.
     
 11) CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS (#164.18) file
     CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT #1 field (#1423)   in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT #2 field (#1423.1) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) 
     CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT #3 field (#1423.2) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) 
     CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT #4 field (#1423.3) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT #5 field (#1423.4) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     Five new fields, CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT #1-5, have been added to the
     ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file.  These fields have been added to the "First
     Course of Treatment - Systemic Therapy" portion of the abstract.  If
     CHEMOTHERAPY is administered, the registrar will be allowed to enter five
     CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT values.  These values will be selectable from the
     CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS file and may be selected by name or the 6-digit
     National Service Center (NSC) number.
 
     If a desired CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT cannot be found in the CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC
     DRUGS file, it may be added via the new "Enter/edit Chemotherapeutic Drugs
     file" [ONC ENTER/ENTER CHEMO DRUGS] option which can be found on the 
     "*..Utility Options ..." [ONCO UTIL MENU] menu.                             
 
 12) *..Casefinding/Suspense ...      [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]
     Automatic Casefinding-Lab Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (LAB)]
 
     DATE/TIME SPECIMEN TAKEN sub-field (#.01)
     within the SURGICAL PATHOLOGY multiple (#8)
     in the LAB DATA file (#63)
 
     DATE/TIME SPECIMEN RECEIVED sub-field (#.1)
     within the SURGICAL PATHOLOGY multiple (#8)
     in the LAB DATA file (#63)
 
     SUSPENSE DATE sub-field (#.01)
     within the SUSPENSE multiple (#75)
     in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160)
 
     The "Automatic Casefinding-Lab Search" option prompts the registrar for a
     "Start Date" and "End Date".  It then searches the DATE/TIME SPECIMEN
     RECEIVED cross-reference for cases within this date range.  When a valid
     suspense case is encountered the program adds the case to suspense using
     the DATE/TIME SPECIMEN RECEIVED value for the SUSPENSE DATE.  This is
     incorrect.  The DATE/TIME SPECIMEN TAKEN value should be used for the
     SUSPENSE DATE.  This has been fixed.
    
 13) ADDITIONAL SERVICE INDICATORS
 
     The following new service indicators have been added to the ONCOLOGY
     PATIENT file (#160).  If blank, the program will provide a default value
     derived from the corresponding PATIENT file (#2) service indicator.
 
     VIETNAM SERVICE field (#62) in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160) 
     (default derived from the VIETNAM SERVICE INDICATED? field (#.32101) in the
     PATIENT file (#2))
 
     GRENADA SERVICE field (#63) in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160)
     (default derived from the GRENADA SERVICE INDICATED? field (#.3224) in the
     PATIENT file (#2))
 
     PANAMA SERVICE field (#64) in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160)
     (default derived from the PANAMA SERVICE INDICATED? field (#.3227) in the
     PATIENT file (#2))
 
     YUGOSLAVIA SERVICE field (#65) in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160)
     (default derived from the YUGOSLAVIA SERVICE INDICATED? field (#.322019) in
     the PATIENT file (#2))
 
     The acceptable values for these fields are:
 
     Y for Yes
     N for No
     U for Unknown
 
     Also, the MIDDLE EAST SERVICE field (#55) in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file 
    (#160) file has been renamed LEBANON SERVICE.
 
     These new fields have been added to the VACCR record layout in the
     following column positions:
 
     Vietnam Service     1607-1607
     Grenada Service     1608-1608
     Panama Service      1609-1609
     Yugoslavia Service  1610-1610
 
 14) *..Casefinding/Suspense ...      [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]                       
     Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (PTF)]             
 
     PTF casefinding has been enhanced to include the following ICD-9 codes:
 
     289.83  MYELOFIBROSIS
     795.06  PAPANICOLAOU SMEAR OF CERVIX WITH CYTOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY
 
 15) *..Casefinding/Suspense ...          [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]                   
     Print Suspense List by Suspense Date [ONCO SUSPENSE PRINT]                  
 
     The "Print Suspense List by Suspense Date" report has been modified to
     include the ICD9 CODE NUMBER field (#.01) and DIAGNOSIS field (#3) of the
     ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) for entries captured via the "Automatic
     Casefinding-PTF Search" option.
 
     Also, the SSN field (#2) of the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160) has been
     replaced in the report by the PID# field (#60) of the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file
     (#160).
  
     The "Print Suspense List by Suspense Date" report will now look like this:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              SUSPENSE PATIENT LIST
 Pid#   Name                            Suspense     Admit        Discharge
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
               SOURCE: PTF FILE
 T9999  TEST,TEST W                     OCT 2, 2008  OCT 1, 2008  OCT 15, 2008
 V10.00 HX OF GI MALIGNANCY NOS  <---ICD9 CODE NUMBER and DIAGNOSIS
 
 16) REPORTING FACILITY field (#.03) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     In accordance with the Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards (FORDS)
     and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR)
     data standards, the field REPORTING HOSPITAL has been renamed REPORTING
     FACILITY.
 
 17) "Not applicable" stuffing for:
     MULT TUM RPT AS ONE PRIM field (#194) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     DATE OF MULTIPLE TUMORS  field (#195) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
     MULTIPLICITY COUNTER     field (#196) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     Information on multiple tumors is not applicable for leukemia M9800-M9949),
     lymphoma (M9590-M9729), immunoproliferative disease (M9760-M9769), and
     unknown primaries (C80.9).  The above fields will be stuffed with the
     appropriate "not applicable" value for these cases.
 
     In order to utilize this stuffing logic, the above fields have been
     re-located to appear immediately after the GRADE/DIFF/CELL TYPE field
     (#24) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) abstract input template.
 
 18) Name--First  [2240] 1972-1985
     Name--Middle [2250] 1986-1999 
 
     The NAACCR data items "Name--First" and "Name--Middle" do not allow the
     inclusion of punctuation characters (e.g. SMITH,JEAN-LUC or SMITH,JOHN
     JEAN-LUC).  Cases with patient name values which contained punctuation
     characters would encounter the following EDITS errors:
 
     1. Name--First (NAACCR)
       E:JEAN-LUC is not a valid value for Name--First 
          Name--First (1972)                  = JEAN-LUC 
 
     2. Name--Middle (NAACCR)
       E:JEAN-LUC is not a valid value for Name--Middle 
           Name--Middle (1986)                 = JEAN-LUC 
 
     These data items are derived from the NAME field (#.01) of the PATIENT
     file (#2).  This field is not within the control of ONCOTRAX registrars.
     Therefore, in order to resolve these EDITS errors, punctuation characters
     will be stripped out of the "Name--First" and "Name--Middle" values.
     e.g. A first or middle name value of "JEAN-LUC" will be extracted as
     "JEANLUC".
    
 19) NAACCR Record Layout Version 11.3
 
     This patch implements NAACCR Record Layout Version 11.3.  There are no
     significant changes from version 11.2.
 
     Changes from version 11.2:
 
     Two new codes have been added to the OVERRIDE AGE/SITE/MORPH field (#205)
     in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5).
 
     1 Reviewed
     2 Reviewed, Dx in utero              <--new code 
     3 Reviewed, Codes 1 and 2 both apply <--new code
   
 20) Stomach C16.0-C16.6, C16.8-C16.9
     CS Site-Specific Factor 1
     Clinical Assessment of Regional Lymph Nodes
 
     Stomach now has a Site-Specific Factor 1 of "Clinical Assessment of
     Regional Lymph Nodes".  It previously had no Site-Specific Factor 1.  The
     888 (Not applicable) stuffing of the SITE-SPECIFIC FACTOR 1 (CS) field
     (#44.1) in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) for stomach cases has been
     removed.
 
 21) <SUBSCRIPT>ONCOTN+44 error
 
     If no histology value was defined, the program would abort with a 
     <SUBSCRIPT> error after the METS EVAL (CS) field (#34.4) prompt in the
     ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5).  Now, if no histology value has been
     defined, the program will display "HISTOLOGY not defined" and jump to the
     appropriate histology prompt.
 
     e.g.
 
     METS EVAL (CS): 
 
          HISTOLOGY not defined.
 
     HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3): 
 
 22) <UNDEFINED>PB+1^ONCOAID error
     *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
     Complete Abstract [ONCO ABSTRACT-ENTER/EDIT]
 
     When adding a new patient, if the PLACE OF BIRTH [STATE] field (#.093) of
     the PATIENT file (#2) contained an invalid value, ONCOTRAX would abort with
     an <UNDEFINED> error.  This has been fixed.
     
 23) WEST PALM BEACH VA MEDICAL CENTER
 
     The FIN field value (#.01) of the FACILITY file (#160.19) for WEST PALM
     BEACH VA MEDICAL CENTER has been changed from 6390003 to 10000011.
 
 24) Removal of punctuation characters from the NAACCR extract
 
     The following NAACCR data items will have any punctuation characters
     in the data replaced with <BLANKS> in the extract record.  This change
     will only affect the extract value and will not modify the stored value.
 
                                                Extract format
                                                ----------------
     Addr at DX--City          [70]     52-71   NCDB STATE VACCR
     Addr at DX--Postal Code   [100]    74-82   NCDB STATE VACCR
     Addr Current--Postal Code [1830] 1329-1337 NCDB STATE VACCR
     Follow-Up Contact--Postal [1846] 1379-1387 NCDB STATE VACCR
     Addr at DX--No & Street   [2330] 2108-2147      STATE VACCR
     Addr at DX--Supplementl   [2335] 2148-2187      STATE VACCR
     Addr Current--No & Street [2350] 2188-2227      STATE VACCR
     Addr Current--Supplementl [2355] 2228-2267      STATE VACCR
    
 25) NAACCR extract report
 
     The NAACCR extract report has been modified to prevent long patient names
     from wrapping to the next line.
 
 26) CASE LAST CHANGED BY field (#100) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file
 
     Stuffing of the CASE LAST CHANGED BY field would occasionally fail.
     When the stuffing failed two question mark characters ("??") would appear
     after the case had successfully passed through the EDITS program.
 
     e.g.
     No EDITS errors or warnings.  ABSTRACT STATUS = 3 (Complete). ??
 
     This has been fixed.
 
 27) Comorbid/Complication 1  [3110] 675-679
     Comorbid/Complication 2  [3120] 680-684
