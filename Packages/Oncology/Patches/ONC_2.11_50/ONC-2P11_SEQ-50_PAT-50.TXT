Description:
============

 ONC*2.11*50 (ICD DIAGNOSIS API)
 
 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator.
  
  1) DIAGNOSIS field (#3) in ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80)
 
     We have been notified that the DIAGNOSIS field in the ICD DIAGNOSIS file 
     is scheduled to be deleted.  In order to accommodate this deletion
     the OncoTrax direct references to DIAGNOSIS have been converted to calls to 
     the $$ICDDX^ICDCODE function.
 
     This change affects the following OncoTrax options. The change should be
     transparent to the registrar.

     For NASAL CAVITY (C30.0), SINUS, MAXILLARY (C31.0) and SINUS, ETHMOID
     (C31.1) cases, if the associated histology is OLFACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA
     (9522/3), the TNM staging fields in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) will
     be stuffed with the "no staging" values.
 
     The following ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) fields will be stuffed:

  6) NEW YORK VA MEDICAL CENTER
 
     There are 2 entries in the FACILITY file (#160.19) for NEW YORK VA MEDICAL
     CENTER.
 
     NEW YORK VA MEDICAL CENTER  6213585
     NEW YORK VA MEDICAL CENTER  10000000
 
     a) FIN number 6213585 has been retired.  The FACILITY file entry
        associated with this FIN has been renamed:
 
        ZZNEW YORK VA MEDICAL CENTER
 
     b) FIN number 10000000 is incorrect.  It has been changed to 10000033.
 
  7) COUNTY file (#5.1) changes
 
     a) The SEER COUNTY CODE field (#2) of the COUNTY file (#5.1) for MIAMI-DADE

 12) Update Contact File [ONCO FOLL-UPDATE CONTACT FILE]
     PRINT TEMPLATE: ONCO CONTACT LIST-A
     PRINT TEMPLATE: ONCO CONTACT LIST-T
 
     The "Update Contact File" option would abort if the registrar entered
     "^xxx" at the "Select function:" prompt (where "xxx" is any alphanumeric
     value.
 
     e.g.
 
     Select Follow-up Procedures Menu Option:  Update Contact File
 
                *************** UPDATE CONTACT FILE ***************
 
     Select one of the following:
 
           1         Add/Edit
           2         Delete
           3         Print
           4         Cleanup
           5         Exit
 
     Select function: ^ABC
 
     RECORDING THAT AN ERROR OCCURRED ---
 
                Sorry 'bout that
 
           $ZERROR=
 
     This has been fixed.
 
     Remedy Ticket #317759
 
 13) Program navigation problem
 
     If the registrar modified a 'Complete' abstract and the modified abstract
     encountered EDITS errors, the registrar was unable to navigate back to
     the Primary Menu Options menu.
 
     Example of problem:
 
     You have made a change to a 'Completed' abstract.
     This abstract needs to be re-run through the EDITS API.
 
     Calling EDITS API...
 
     EDITS errors were encountered.
 
     The ABSTRACT STATUS has been changed to 0 (Incomplete).
 
     Do you wish to return to the Primary Menu Options? Yes// YES
 
     **********FOLLOW-UP**********  <---Program should return to
                                        Primary Menu Options
     This has been fixed.
 
 14) PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER field (#148) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file
 
     PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER has been renamed OTHER CANCER.
 
 15) "Records appear to have unequal lengths"
 
     If a word-processing text item (e.g. TEXT-REMARKS) contained an embedded LF
     (line feed) or CR (carriage return) character, the NAACCR (North American
     Association of Central Cancer Registries) output record would be corrupted
     and GENEDITS would generate a "Records appear to have unequal lengths"
     error message.
 
     All word-processing NAACCR data items will now have any LF or CR characters
     removed from the NAACCR output record.
   
 16) EDITS error "Cod & Icd_code conflict"
     CAUSE OF DEATH field (#19) in ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160)
 
     Some ICD-9 codes require 5 digits to be meaningful (e.g. Mantle cell
     lymphoma 200.40 - 200.48).  The NAACCR data item CAUSE OF DEATH [1910]
     has a length of 4.  If, for example, CAUSE OF DEATH is coded 200.47
     (MANTLE CELL LYMPH SPLEEN) the following EDITS error will occur:
 
     ICD Revision Number, Cause of Death (SEER IF37)
     E:Cod & Icd_code conflict 
         Cause of Death (1388)               = 2004
         ICD Revision Number (1392)          = 9 
 
     To resolve this EDITS error, ICD-9 codes will no longer be exported in the
     NAACCR data item CAUSE OF DEATH.
 
     The special CAUSE OF DEATH codes 0000, 7777 and 7797 will continue to be
     exported.
 
     NOTE: CAUSE OF DEATH is no longer supported by CoC (Commission on Cancer).
 
 17) FOLLOWING REGISTRY sub-field (#10) within the FOLLOW-UP multiple (#400) in
     the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160)
     INPUT TEMPLATE: ONCO FOLLOW-UP
 
     When checking if the FOLLOWING REGISTRY entry is associated with a National
     Provider Identifier (NPI) code, the program could erroneously generate the
     following message:
 
     This facility needs to be associated with
     an NPI (National Provider Identifier) code.
 
     The FOLLOWING REGISTRY entry may, in fact, be correctly associated with an
     NPI.  The above message was being generated in error.  This has been fixed.
     
 18) NAACCR RECORD LAYOUT 11.3
 
     The following data items have been added to the NCDB EXTRACT V11.3 format:
 
     NPI - Physician - Primary Surgeon           1447-1456 
     NPI - Physician 3 (Radiation Oncologist)    1457-1466 
     NPI - Physician 4 (Medical Oncologist)      1467-1476

             2008
 
 19) Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (RAD)]
 
     The [Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search] option has been enhanced to
     search for the following diagnostic codes.
 
     BIRAD CATEGORY 4 (Suspicious)
     BIRAD CATEGORY 5 (Highly Suggestive of Malignancy)
     BIRAD CATEGORY 6 (Known Biopsy Proven Malignancy)
 
     NOTE: These DIAGNOSTIC CODES have not as yet been deployed to the
           DIAGNOSTIC CODES file (#78.3).  They will be implemented in patches
           LEX*2*55 and RA*5*97.
 
 20) 8148/2 GLANDULAR INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA, GR III
 
     Cases with an histology value of 8148/2 (GLANDULAR INTRAEPITHELIAL
     NEOPLASIA, GR III) will no longer be extracted for export to the NCDB or
     State Registries.  These cases will continue to be extracted for the VACCR.
 
 21) SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F)      (#138.4) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file
     SCOPE OF LN SURGERY @FAC (F) (#138.5) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file
     CLASS OF CASE                (#.04)   in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file
 
     If CLASS OF CASE = 5 (Dx at autopsy) SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) and SCOPE OF
     LN SURGERY @FAC (F) were being stuffed with 0 (None) for all cases.  This
     was incorrect.
 
     For the the following primaries SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) and SCOPE OF LN
     SURGERY @FAC (F) should be stuffed with 9 (Unknown/NA) when CLASS OF CASE = 
     5:
 
     -For primaries of the meninges, brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, and
      other part of the central nervous system (C70.0-C70.9, C71.0-C71.9, 
      C72.0-C72.9)
     -For lymphomas with a lymph node primary site (C77.0-C77.9)
     -For an unknown or ill-defined primary site (C76.0-C76.8, C80.9) or for
      hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, or
      myeloproliferative disease.
         
      This has been fixed.
 
 22) TREATMENT GUIDELINES
 
     The following fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5):
     TREATMENT GUIDELINE #1 (#228)
     TREATMENT GUIDELINE #2 (#229)
     TREATMENT GUIDELINE #3 (#230)
     TREATMENT GUIDELINE LOCATION (#231)
 
     These fields have been added to the "First Course of Treatment" portion of
     the abstract.
 
 23) PERFORMANCE STATUS AT DX (#227) in ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5)
 
     The following codes have been added to PERFORMANCE STATUS AT DX:
 
     4 Score 4
     5 Score 5
     9 Unknown/not documented
 
     These codes are further defined in the field description as follows:
 
     4 - Bedbound (Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care.
         Totally confined to bed or chair)
     5 - Death 
     9 - Unknown/not documented
 
 24) STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC (#165.5,87) computation using CLINICAL M
     (#165.5,37.3) instead of PATHOLOGIC M (#165.5,87)
 
     In patch ONC*2.11*47 we implemented the following STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC
     automatic staging rule:
 
     "For computing pathologic stage, use pT and pN.  Then, if pM is 1, 1A, 1B,
     1C, or 1M use it; otherwise use the value of cM (whether it is blank, cMX,
     cM0, cM1, cM1a, cM1b, cM1c or 88) to calculate pathologic stage group."
 
     a) This rule has been revised and now reads as follows:
 
     "For computing pathologic stage, use pT and pN.  Then, if pM is 1, 1A, 1B,
     1C, or 1M use it; otherwise use the value of cM (unless cM is cMX) to       
     calculate pathologic stage group."
         
     b) At the time of patch ONC*2.11*47 existing cases were not re-staged as
     part of the patch installation.
 
     This patch will look for AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) 6th
     Edition (2003+) cases for which the revised rule applies and re-stage them
     when the patch is installed.
 
     NOTE: This item pertains to Vista Automatic Staging, NOT Collaborative
           Staging.                                                             
 
 25) DRE +/- (#165.5,102) and PSA (#165.5,684) 'HELP'
 
     The HELP texts for DRE +/- and PSA have been modified.
 
     a) DRE +/-
        The HELP text now reads:
 
        A clinically inapparent tumor is one that is neither palpable nor
        reliably visible by imaging.  An apparent tumor is palpable or visible
        by imaging.
          
        DO NOT INFER inapparent or apparent tumor based on the registrar's
        interpretation of terms in the DRE or imaging reports. A physician 
        assignment of cT1C or cT2 is a clear statement of inapparent or
        apparent respectively.
 
     b) PSA
        The first sentence of the HELP text now reads:
 
        Records the results of the highest pre-treatment Prostate Specific
        Antigen (PSA) test given within the last 12 months.
