 **************************************************************************
  
 Clinic Orders
 =========================================
 This patch contains changes to support clinic orders enhancements in
 patch PSB*3*70. Support is accomplished by modifying Inpatient Medications
 software to send active clinic orders with the clinic name to the Bar Code
 Medication Administration (BCMA) software.
  
 A new mail group PSJ CLINIC DEFINITION has been created to provide a 
 means by which pharmacy personnel may be notified when clinic orders are 
 created for clinics that have not been set up completely. If a clinic 
 order, or Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) order, is created in
 CPRS for a clinic that is not defined in the CLINIC DEFINITION (#53.46)
 file, a message is sent to the  PSJ CLINIC DEFINITION mail group
 indicating the order will not display in BCMA unless the clinic is defined
 in the CLINIC DEFINITION (#53.46) file, and the SEND TO BCMA? (#3) field
 is set to YES.
  
  
 IV Bag Logic
 ------------
 This patch modifies Inpatient Order Entry so that when Inpatient orders
 are edited, BCMA IV parameters are now checked to determine if IV labels
 were invalidated as a result of the edit. If labels were invalidated, 
 the pharmacy user making the edit is informed and a list of the
 invalidated IV labels are displayed. The pharmacy user is given an 
 opportunity to print replacement labels, including when no new order is
 created as a result of the edit.
  
 T@0 Infusion Rate (Number of Labels per Day)
 --------------------------------------------
 This patch creates a new field called Labels Per Day. The value in this 
 field, if populated, will override the system-calculated number of IV 
 labels. The Labels Per Day field will be accessible in Inpatient Order
 Entry, via the Infusion Rate field (the Labels Per Day prompt will display
 immediately after the prompt for Infusion Rate).
  
 Previous existing functionality allowing the entry of the number of
 labels directly into the Infusion Rate field via the "@" character (e.g.
 125@1) will be retained, and the number of labels entered after the "@"
 character will automatically populate the Labels Per Day field.
  
 A new INFUSION INSTRUCTIONS (#53.47) file facilitates the entry of 
 commonly used standard text, or 'canned' messages, in the INFUSION RATE 
 (#.08) field in the IV (#100) sub-file of the PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file.
  
 An abbreviation entered into the INFUSION RATE (#.08) field in the IV 
 (#100) sub-file of the PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) sub-file (via Inpatient
 Order Entry) is replaced with expanded text, if the abbreviation
 has been defined in the INFUSION INSTRUCTIONS file (#53.47.)
  
 Pre-Exchange Report for Clinic Orders
 --------------------------------------
 A new PRE-EXCHANGE REPORT DEVICE (#5) field is being added to the CLINIC 
 DEFINITION (#53.46) file. The field, if populated, contains a device that 
 will be the default print device at the prompt "Select DEVICE for 
 PRE-EXCHANGE UNITS REPORT:" that displays after a clinic order is 
 verified.
  
  
 PSJ CLINIC DEFINITION mail group
 ---------------------------------
 A new PSJ CLINIC DEFINITION mail group is being added to the MAIL GROUP 
 (#3.8) file. A mail message is sent to this mail group when a valid 
 Clinic Order is filed in the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS (#53.1) file that is 
 associated with a location that is not defined in the CLINIC DEFINITION 
 (#53.46) file.

 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs)
 -----------------------------
 PSPO 452  - Reported occurrence of patient receiving increased titration 
             rate of morphine.(HD 173063)
  
 PSPO 1448 - Normal Saline is displaying on a Sodium Bicarbonate D5W order.
             (HD 322729, HD 278810, HD 615239)
            
 PSPO 1855 - Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatient orders (IMO) start 
             date/time is the date/time of the appointment, which may not 
             be accurate. (HD 178352)
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 HD 178352 - Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) orders start 
 date/time is the date/time of the appointment, which may not be accurate. 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Problem - When IMO orders are created in CPRS, the appointment date/time 
 selected by the ordering provider is used as the default start date/time 
 of the order when the order is finished in Inpatient Medications, even if 
 the appointment date/time is in the past, prior to the actual creation of 
 the order. This may cause confusion about the true start date/time of the 
 order.
  
 Resolution - Use the appointment date/time selected by the ordering 
 provider as the default start date/time for IMO orders if the appointment 
 date/time is on or after the date/time the order is finished by the 
 finishing pharmacist. If the appointment date/time is prior to the 
 date/time the order is finished by the finishing pharmacist, the current 
 date/time (i.e. NOW) is used as the order's default start date/time at 
 the time the order is finished.
  
  
 HD 322729, HD 278810, HD 615239 - Normal Saline order displays on a 
 Sodium Bicarbonate D5W order.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Problem: When an infusing IV order changes significantly via an edit, 
 previously printed IV labels may continue to display as available bags in 
 BCMA with the 'old' order information (the order as it existed prior to 
 the change), if the BCMA IV Parameters are not set up to invalidate the 
 IV labels and bags based on the changed field(s). Alternatively, if the 
 IV labels and bags are invalidated based on the BCMA IV parameters, the 
 finishing pharmacist is not aware of the existence of the invalidated 
 bags. Pharmacy users are not typically aware of the field settings of the
 BCMA IV parameters, making it difficult for pharmacy to know which edits 
 will invalidate IV labels and bags, and when to retrieve invalidated 
 bags to prevent them from being infused inadvertently.
  
 Resolution: At the time a changed IV order is finished, display to the 
 finishing pharmacist a list of previously printed IV labels that were 
 invalidated due to the change, and the changed field that triggered the 
 invalidation based on the BCMA IV parameters. Alternatively, if the 
 change did not invalidate the IV labels, display the list of IV labels 
 that continue to be available for infusion. In addition, add a column 
 titled "Available in BCMA" to the IV Label Log to indicate each label's 
 current availability for infusion.
  
 HD 173063 - Request separate area for IV Label suppression.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Problem: VA facilities may enter text followed by "@" into the VistA 
 field titled "Infusion Rate" that can lead to misunderstanding. This 
 capability has been available in the VistA system since 1994. 
  
 Resolution: Add a new field titled "NUMBER OF LABELS PER DAY" to the 
 Inpatient Medications IV software package to allow the pharmacy 
 flexibility to indicate the number of IV labels to print per day.
  
 INC801240 - Technician entered non-verified IV order hangs.
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 Problem: When a pharmacy technician copied two IV orders the pharmacist is
 unable to verify the second order.  When the second of the two copied IV 
 orders is selected in Inpatient Order Entry, the order checking software
 causes the process to hang indefinitely.
  
 Resolution: When the second of two copied IV orders in the NON-VERIFIED
 ORDERS (#53.1) file is processed, verify that the previous order filed in 
 the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS (#53.1) file is left blank if the order was 
 created as a result of the COPY action.
  
 CQ BCMA00001657 - Long Profile problem with non-Active Unit Dose orders.
 ---------------
 Problem: The Long Profile view in the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
 option and the Order Entry [PSJU NE] option are using the HOURS OF
 RECENTLY DC/EXPIRED (#7) field parameter in the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS
 (#59.6) file to determine the beginning of the range of dates within which
 to display non-active Unit Dose orders, rather than the patient's last
 Admission Date. The HOURS RECENTLY DC/EXPIRED parameter is (correctly)
 used by the Short Profile.
  
 Resolution: Change the Long Profile in the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
 option and the Order Entry [PSJU NE] option to use the patient's last
 Admission Date to determine the beginning of the range of dates within
 which non-active Unit Dose orders display. The Short Profile will continue
 using the HOURS RECENTLY DC/EXPIRED parameter.
