Description:
============

  
 ******************************  NOTE ***********************************
 After install of this patch, the 2nd line of PSJLIACT routine will not
 contain patch number 257, and 257 will be re-added with patch PSJ*5*296.
 ************************************************************************
  
 This patch is part of MOCHA 2.0 FAST TRACK PATCHES 1.0 build that 
 contains PSO*7*431 and PSJ*5*299. 
  
 This patch is part of a group of host file patches that make up the new
 Medication Order Check Healthcare Application v2.0 (MOCHA). These patches
 contain software that supports MOCHA v2.0 functionality. 
  
 **************************************************************************
 When using the option Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD 
 COMPARE TO SYSTEM] with the host file MOCHA_2_0_FAST_TRACK_BUILDS you 
 will see the following warnings on certain routines:
  
 Host file: MOCHA_2_0_FAST_TRACK_BUILDS.KID contains: PSO*7*431, PSJ*5*299
  
 PSJ*5*299:
  
 Routine:  PSIVORFB
 *** WARNING, you are missing one or more Patches ***
  
 Routine:  PSJLIACT
 *** WARNING, your routine has different patches than the incoming routine 
 ***
  
 These warnings are due to the sequence of released patches prior to MOCHA 
 v2.0. Once all the MOCHA v2.0 patches are installed, the second lines of
 the routines will be updated appropriately.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 The following describes the modifications contained within this patch:
  
 1.  CCR 6704:  A pending order that is finished, then edited and verified
 within the same session within Inpatient Meds does not kill the CIMO cross
 reference for NON-VERIFIED file (#53.1).  Order checks are correctly
 displayed.  Orders left in the cross reference over time will take up more
 space.  Order checking will not be slowed because the system looks at the
 specified time frame for clinic.  A correction was made to delete the
 cross reference entry when the order is verified.  The cleanup for the
 cross reference entries are done under CCR 6610 described below.
  
 2.  CCR 6721:  A test site reported an issue where an old "discontinued
 due to edit" inpatient non-verified order is showing up as an order check.
 This order is defined in the cross reference for NON-VERIFIED ORDERS 
 file (#53.1) and should not be.  A modification was made to only allow
 pending or non-verified orders to be stored in the cross reference and to
 verify when processing orders that only pending and non-verified orders
 are included in order checks.  Additionally CCR 6710 will clean up any 
 existing orders that should not be in the cross reference.
  
 3.  CCR 6710: CLIN 1 Support installed MOCHA 2.0 in their account and an 
 error occurred during indexing of PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).  The error 
 was caused by an invalid entry in the file which was subsequently removed.
 In order to complete the post install, it was necessary to reinstall the
 patch again.  
  
 To eliminate having to reinstall the build when such an error occurs, a
 restart function was added to give IRM's the capability to run the post
 install separately.  From the programmers command prompt (>), sites can
 restart the post install by typing:
  
     >D RESTART^PSJ299PO
  
 The post install routine will re-index the CIMO cross reference for
 NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1) and the CIMOU, CIMOCLU, CIMOCLI and CIMOI
 cross references for PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). This will clean up any
 old IMO cross references created as a result of CCR 6704 and CCR
 6721 above. 
  
 4. CCR 6732:  With v14 of MOCHA 2.0 FOLLOW UP COMBINED build the routine
 PSIVORFB was included in the last build, and this routine was missing
 nationally released PSJ*5*285 changes.  PSJ*5*285 was a VistA Maintenance
 patch and did not have a patient safety.  The missing line of code was
 restored and the 2nd line of the routine was changed to reflect PSJ*5*285.
  
 5. CCR 6732:  Patch PSJ*5*285 was incorporated for shared routine 
 PSIVORFB.  During incorporation it was determined that PSIVORFB code 
 changes added for PSJ*5*257 patch were not needed.  The PSJ*5*257 code 
 changes were removed and PSJ*5*285 was incorporated.
  
 6. CCR 6744:  Patch PSJ*5*292 was incorporated for shared routine PSJO1.
