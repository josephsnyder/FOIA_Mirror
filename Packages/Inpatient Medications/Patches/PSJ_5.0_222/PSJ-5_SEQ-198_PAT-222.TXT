Subject: FY09 Q4 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will be released as the Inpatient Medications portion of
 the Pharmacy Legacy Quarterly Enhancements team's FY09 Q4 effort.
  
 This enhancement will address Patient Safety Issue PSI-07-055,
 PSPO #508, Remedy Ticket #180596, and was approved by the Inpatient
 Medications Workgroup.
  
 Problem
 -------
 Currently, for complex unit dose orders that contain an "AND" conjunction,
 there is a possibility of the child orders containing overlapping
 administration (admin) times. If the admin times overlap, it is possible
 for a patient to receive too much of the medication at the overlapping
 admin time.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 This enhanced functionality will compare the admin time string of the
 child orders on either side of the "AND" conjunction and will capture
 any overlapping admin times. If any overlapping admin times are
 found, a warning message will be displayed to the pharmacist who is
 finishing the order. The warning message will read:
  
 **WARNING**
  
 The highlighted admin times for these portions of this complex order overlap.
  
 Part 1 has a schedule of BID and admin time(s) of 10-22.
 Part 2 has a schedule of QDAY and admin time(s) of 10.
  
 Please ensure the schedules and administration times are appropriate.
