This patch will be released as the Inpatient Medications portion of
"BLD",6896,1,2,0)
the Pharmacy Legacy Quarterly Enhancements team's FY09 Q4 effort.

This enhancement will address Patient Safety Issue PSI-07-055,
"BLD",6896,1,5,0)
PSPO #508, Remedy Ticket #180596, and was approved by the Inpatient
"BLD",6896,1,6,0)

Problem
"BLD",6896,1,9,0)
-------
"BLD",6896,1,10,0)
Currently, for complex unit dose orders that contain an "AND" conjunction,
"BLD",6896,1,11,0)
there is a possibility of the child orders containing overlapping
"BLD",6896,1,12,0)
administration (admin) times. If the admin times overlap, it is possible
"BLD",6896,1,13,0)
for a patient to receive too much of the medication at the overlapping
"BLD",6896,1,14,0)
admin time.
"BLD",6896,1,15,0)
 
"BLD",6896,1,16,0)
Resolution
"BLD",6896,1,17,0)
----------
"BLD",6896,1,18,0)
This enhanced functionality will compare the admin time string of the
"BLD",6896,1,19,0)
child orders on either side of the "AND" conjunction and will capture
"BLD",6896,1,20,0)
any overlapping admin times. If any overlapping admin times are
"BLD",6896,1,21,0)
found, a warning message will be displayed to the pharmacist who is
"BLD",6896,1,22,0)
finishing the order. The warning message will read:
"BLD",6896,1,23,0)
 
"BLD",6896,1,24,0)
**WARNING**
"BLD",6896,1,25,0)
 
"BLD",6896,1,26,0)
The highlighted admin times for these portions of this complex order 
"BLD",6896,1,27,0)
overlap.
"BLD",6896,1,28,0)
 
"BLD",6896,1,29,0)
Part 1 has a schedule of BID and admin time(s) of 10-22.
"BLD",6896,1,30,0)
Part 2 has a schedule of QDAY and admin time(s) of 10.
"BLD",6896,1,31,0)
 
"BLD",6896,1,32,0)
Please ensure the schedules and administration times are appropriate.
