Associated patches: (v)PSJ*5*213   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSJ*5*229'

Subject: INCORRECT STOP DATE CALCULATED AND OTHER ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide software bug fixes for Inpatient 
 Medications to correct the following issues:
  
 1. Dose limit calculations are not correct when entered from the infusion 
    dialog in CPRS.
 2. The stop date/times are incorrect for IV Piggyback orders created in
    CPRS where there is a dose limit and an IV ROOM stop time was defined.
 3. Scheduled labels are not printing if ATZERO flag removed from infusion
    rate.
 4. Stop date/times are not calculating correctly for IV orders with a
    duration of 24 hours.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
  
 1. HD0000000339101 - PSPO# 00001478 - IV order 3x/wk for 8 doses- when 
                      stop time is entered as 8, the computer calculates for 
                      8 days not 8 doses
  Problem:
  --------
  Dose limit calculations are not correct when entered from the 
  infusion dialog in CPRS. There is no logic to calculate day of week 
  schedules and schedules with a frequency greater than 1440 (dose to be 
  given less than once a day).  The medication stop date/time is being 
  calculated based on days instead of doses.
  
  Resolution:
  ----------- 
  Logic has been added to the routines PSIVCAL and PSIVSP to correctly
  calculate the dose limits from CPRS so the calculated medication stop
  date/time will match the calculation in VistA.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000282450 - Stop date calculated incorrectly?
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When finishing a dose limit IV Piggyback order created in CPRS, the stop
  date would not calculate correctly based on the dose limit. If a stop time
  is defined for a particular IV ROOM, this stop time would be used instead
  of the dose limit.  This usually set the stop date past the last dose of
  the order. If there was no stop time defined for the IV ROOM, the system
  would use 2359 as the stop time, which would also usually set the stop 
  date/time past the dose limit. Both of these scenarios would cause
  additional doses to be given.
  
  Resolution:
  ----------- 
  The routine PSIVCAL has been modified to use the dose limit to calculate 
  the stop date/time if the order has a dose limit. This will prevent the
  order from having more doses than expected by the dose limit.  This will
  cause the stop date/time to be calculated in the same way as it would be
  calculated if the dose limit was entered in VistA.
  
  
 3. HD0000000347116 - Edited infusion rate to remove 250 ml/hr@0 and 
                      scheduled labels still not printing
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When the Pharmacist edited an IV order infusion rate and removed an
  ATZERO flag, the schedule labels still will not print. The ATZERO flag is
  not being removed from the infusion rate field even after being deleted
  by the Pharmacist causing scheduled labels not to print.
  
  Resolution:
  ----------- 
  Modified routine PSIVCAL to reset the ATZERO flag to 0 before the order is
  edited. This will cause the order to always expect to print labels unless
  the "@0" is found in the infusion rate. When this is set, the ATZERO flag
  will be set to 1 which suppresses label printing.
  
  
 4. HD0000000217087 - IV Time frames in question
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The duration on IV orders is not calculating correctly. A duration of 23
  hours stops the order after 23 hours, and a duration of 25 hours stops 
  the order after 25 hours; however, a duration of 24 hours stops the 
  order at t+1 day @ 23:59 where 23:59 is set by the inpatient ward parameter
  as a default time.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The routine PSIVCAL has been modified to determine if a dose limit has
  been entered. Based on this change the system will use the more restrictive
  limit in calculating stop date/time which in this case will be the dose 
  limit of 24 hours thus preventing extra doses.
