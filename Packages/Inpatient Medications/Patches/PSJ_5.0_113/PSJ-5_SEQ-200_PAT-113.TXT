Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide software enhancements defined by
 Increment 1 of the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Inpatient
 Medications Request (IMR) for Special Focus Group (SFG) Initial Request
 Analysis (IRA). This patch works in conjunction with Pharmacy Data
 Management V.1.0 patch PSS*1*143.
  
 Currently, Inpatient Medications allows orders to be created with
 conflicting administration times, frequencies, schedules, and schedule
 types such that orders may not always display correctly on the Virtual
 Due List (VDL) in the Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA)
 application. This enhancement adds several new order validation checks
 to improve the data that is displayed on the VDL. These order
 validation requirements will apply to Unit Dose Medications and applied
 to intermittent IV orders schedules (IV orders do not have Schedule
 Type).
  
                           ***  WARNING  ***
  The following enhancements do not prevent, or display warnings for, 
  every inappropriate combination of schedule type and schedule in Unit
  Dose orders. Example: The schedule type of a Continuous order may still
  be changed to One Time, leaving the order with a Continuous schedule and
  a One Time schedule type. 
  
  
 These enhancements are:
  
 1.  Order Validation Check One
 For Intermittent IV orders, references to an order's Schedule Type will
 refer to either the TYPE OF SCHEDULE from the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE
 file (#51.1), or Pro Re Nata (PRN) or "as needed" for schedule names in
 PRN format, or CONTINUOUS for schedule names in Day of Week format.
  
 2. Order Validation Check Two
 The system shall use the schedule type of the schedule from the
 Administration Schedule (#51.1) file independent of the schedule name
 when processing an order to determine if administration times are required
 for a particular order.
  
 3.  Order Validation Check Three
 If an order has the Schedule Type of Continuous and the Schedule
 entered is NOT in Day of Week (Ex. MO-FR) or PRN (Ex. TID PC PRN)
 format, then the system shall prevent the number of administration
 times associated with the order from being greater than the number of
 administration times for that frequency, if the orders frequency is
 numeric (minutes).  The number of administration times can be less than
 the maximum but not equal to zero administration times.
  
 4.  Order Validation Check Four
 If an order has a Schedule Type of Continuous and is an Odd Schedule, a
 schedule whose frequency is not evenly divisible by or into 1440
 minutes (1 day), then the system shall prevent the entry of
 administration times.
  
 5.  Order Validation Check Five
 If an order has a Schedule Type of Continuous with a non-odd frequency
 of greater than of 1 day (1440 minutes) then the system shall prevent
 more than one administration time.
  
 6.  Order Validation Check Six
 If an order has a Schedule Type of One Time or if an order is entered
 with a schedule that is defined in the schedule file as One Time then
 the system shall prevent the user from entering more than one
 administration time.
  
 7.  Order Validation Check Seven
 For an order with a Schedule Type of Continuous where no
 doses/administration times are scheduled between the order's Start
 Date/Time and the Stop Date/Time, then the system shall present a
 warning message to the user and not allow the order to be accepted or
 verified until the Start/Stop Date Times, schedule, and/or
 administration times are adjusted so that at least one dose is
 scheduled to be given.
  
 8.  Change the Sequence of the Schedule Type and Schedule Prompts
 Currently the order of the prompts in inpatient meds order entry is
 Schedule Type followed by Schedule.  The sequence of the prompts will
 be changed so that the Schedule prompt falls before the Schedule Type
 prompt.
  
 9.  Schedule Validation Requirement One
 When a schedule is selected at the Schedule Field the system shall
 default the Schedule Type for the schedule entered from the 
 Administration Schedule (#51.1) file into the order.
  
 10.  Schedule Validation Requirement Two
 If the user changes the schedule, a warning message will be generated 
 stating that the administration times and the schedule type for the order 
 will be changed to reflect the defaults for the schedule selected.
  
 11.  Schedule Validation Check Three
 If the schedule type is changed from Continuous to PRN using the "ED  
 Edit Action" in Inpatient Order Entry, the system shall automatically 
 remove any administration times that were associated with the schedule so 
 that the order will not include administration times.
  
 12.  Modify VistA Help Text
 The Help Text in Inpatient Order Entry was modified to add additional
 text so the user is able to see the added constraints when entering
 Administration Times.
  
 NOTE: With this patch, manual changes to Schedule Type in Unit Dose orders
       should be restricted to "Fill on Request"; all other schedule types
       should be allowed to default in from the Administration Schedule 
       (#51.1) file. PRN orders should use schedules composed of a valid
       schedule from the Administration Schedule (#51.1) file appended with
       " PRN" (space PRN). For example, BID PRN, DAILY PRN, etc. This will
       ensure the appropriate schedule type will default into the order.
  
 NOTE: With this patch, the Schedule Type field in Inpatient Order Entry
       requires the specific code: "C" for Continuous, "F" or "R" for 
       Fill on Request, "O" for One Time, "OC" for On Call, "P" for PRN. 
       The Schedule Type field will no longer perform a partial lookup of
       the full name of the schedule type.
  
 NOTE: If identically named schedules exist in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE
       (#51.1) file, and the multiple identically named schedule entries do
       not all have the same value in the TYPE OF SCHEDULE (#5) field, then
       for intermittent IV orders containing one of these identically named
       schedules, admin times will always be optional.
       For example, if three schedules named DAILY exist in the
       ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE (#51.1), and two of the schedules' TYPE OF
       SCHEDULE (#5) field is Continuous, but the third schedule's TYPE OF
       SCHEDULE (#5) field is not Continuous, then warnings that would
       normally display in the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option (and 
       related order entry options) about missing or required admin times
       may not display.

 take less than 1 minute.
  
 This patch works in conjunction with patch PSS*1*143. The order in
 which the patches are installed is not important, however, the 
 patches should be installed together as the changes in PSS*1*143 will not
 be fully implemented until PSJ*5*113 is installed.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
