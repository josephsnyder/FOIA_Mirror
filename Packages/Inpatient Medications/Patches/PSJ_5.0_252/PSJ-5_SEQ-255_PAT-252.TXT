Subject: MEDICATION ORDER CHECK HEALTHCARE APPLICATION v2.0

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is part of a group of host file patches that make up the new
 Medication Order Check Healthcare Application v2.0 (MOCHA). These patches
 contain software that supports MOCHA v2.0 functionality.  The host files
 were created to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration
 (VHA) facilities. 
  
 The following patient safety issue has also been addressed in this 
 release:
  
   PSPO #2069 - CPRS and VistA Inpatient Pharmacy package return inadequate
     alert message for allergy information.
  
  
 Patch Information:
 ------------------
 The following patches will be distributed in a phased release and sites 
 will be given access to the host files during their scheduled phase of
 implementation:
  
   1. PSS_1_160.KID
   2. PSS_1_173.KID
   3. MOCHA_2_0.KID contains: PSO*7*372, PSJ*5*252, and OR*3*345
   4. MOCHA_2_0_FOLLOW_UP_COMBINED_BUILD.KID contains: PSO*7*416,
         PSJ*5*257, GMRA*4*47, and OR*3*311
   5. OR_3_381.KID
   6. MOCHA_2_0_FAST_TRACK_BUILDS.KID contains: PSO*7*431, PSJ*5*299

 http://vaww.oed.portal.domain.ext/projects/pre/PRE_M2_Deploy_Trng/PRE_VA_User_
 M2_Deploy_Trng/SitePages/Home.aspx
  
 PSS_1_160 and PSS_1_173 include the components necessary for the
 interface that will be used in MOCHA v2.0.  The MOCHA 2.0 and 
 MOCHA 2.0 FOLLOW UP COMBINED BUILD include the modifications to implement
 Max Single Dose Order checks for the Order Entry Results Reporting (OERR),
 Inpatient Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy applications.
  
 These patches will add a maximum single dose order check to the current
 VistA medication order checking system that uses the First DataBank (FDB)
 business logic and database. In this initial phase of dosing
 functionality, the Maximum Single Dose information will be displayed to
 the user.  The following scenarios describe the types of messaging added:
  
   1. If the dosage entered passes the dosing checks, no message will be
      displayed.
  
   2. If the dosage entered is too high, the Single Dose warning
      message will be displayed.
  
   3. If the dose checks were not able to be performed, a generic message
      will be displayed notifying the user that a manual check needs to be
      completed to verify appropriate dosing.
  
 **************************************************************************
 When using the option Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD 
 COMPARE TO SYSTEM] with the host file MOCHA_2_0.KID you will see the 
 following warnings on certain routines:
  
 Host file: MOCHA_2_0.KID contains: PSO*7*372, PSJ*5*252, and OR*3*345
  
 PSJ*5*252:
  
 Routine:  PSJBLDOC
 *** WARNING, your routine has more patches than the incoming routine ***
  
 Routine:  PSJGMRA, PSJOC, PSJOCDI
 *** WARNING, your routine has different patches than the incoming routine 
 ***
  
 These warnings are due to the sequence of released patches prior to MOCHA 
 v2.0. Once all the MOCHA v2.0 patches are installed, the second lines of
 the routines will be updated appropriately.
 **************************************************************************
  
 The following issues are also addressed by this patch:
  
 1. When entering or finishing an order with a drug that causes an
 interaction to the additives/premixes of an IV order, the order is
 displayed multiple times on the drug interaction warning.  This patch
 screens out the duplicate and only displays the order one time. Code
 Change Request (CCR) #3987.
  
 2. The stop date may not be calculated correctly if during the finish of
 an order an additive is not selected until the accept/edit screen.  
 The patch will recalculate the stop date when the additive/solution is
 edited during the finishing of an order. CCR #4336.
  
 3. An undefined error occurred at CPRS+7^PSJOCOR when the dispense drug 
 used in the order was not tied to an Orderable Item.  This is a data issue
 but the code is corrected to prevent the error from happening.  
 HD0000000507452 (CCR #4512).
  
 4. The default response on the allergy alert question "Do you want to
 intervene?" is set at "NO" for the Inpatient Medications (IP) orders and
 "YES" for the Outpatient orders. Prior to installation of MOCHA v1.0 the
 default for IP orders was also set to "YES".  PSPO #2069,
 HD0000000508384 (CCR #4526)
  
 5. Fix the Single dose amount calculation for Requirement 3.8.11.123.  
 This change removed the screening of drugs with the VA CLASSIFICATION of
 "TN" so the "CONTINUED INFUSTION" route can be used in the dosing checks.
 CCR #4069.
  
 6. The dosing message currently displayed in VistA and Computerized 
 Patient Record System (CPRS) for orders with a duration greater than or
 equal to 24 hours is confusing and does not match the requirements. This
 change corrects the calculation and displays the message clearer when the
 single dose amount is adjusted.  CCR #4281.
  
 7. Multiple exception messages are displayed for the same drug by CPRS.  
 This change will help pass a flag to the interface code to eliminate
 the extra message.  CCR #4290.
  
 8. In order for the dosing checks to work, the unit of Liter had to be
 used for drugs containing "Potassium".  First DataBank (FDB) is now able
 to accept Milliliter.  This change removes the unit conversion from "ML"
 to "L".  CCR #4439.
  
 9. Corrects the spelling of "INTRATHECAL" when checking for the FDB 
 mapping of this Medication Route.  CCR #4440.
  
 10. If the patient has multiple orders on the profile with the same drug 
 and the user is entering or finishing an order using the same drug that 
 is not matched to National Drug File (NDF) or has no GCNSEQNO, the
 exceptions are displayed twice.  CCR #4523.
  
 11. An unexpected error occurs during dosing check when finishing a 
 pending unit dose order with a duration less than 24 hours.  The 
 frequency is incorrectly set to zero. This patch will fix this
 problem.  CCR #4981.
  
 12. The wrong dosing message was displayed after the Dosage Ordered for a 
 Unit Dose order was edited. This patch will make sure the correct dosage 
 is used in the dosing checks.  CCR #4764.
  
 13. Two additional FDB continuous dose routes have to be added to the 
 dosage check logic for IV orders. They are Cont Intraosseous and Cont 
 Caudal infusion. The code is modified to check for these two routes.  CCR 
 #5026.
