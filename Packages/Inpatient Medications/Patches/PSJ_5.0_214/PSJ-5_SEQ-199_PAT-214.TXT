Description:
============

 Patches PSJ*5*214 and PSN*4*193 are being released as part of the Class
 III to Class I conversion process.  In combination, the two 
 patches address the need to provide multidivisional functionality within
 the Inpatient Medications package's Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ
 PDV] option. PSN*4*193 provides support within the National Drug File
 package and PSJ*5*214 delivers the enhanced functionality of the Patients
 on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option.
  
 Sites using Class III versions of this program are advised to begin using 
 the Class I version upon install of this patch.  There are no special 
 installation instructions for sites with the Class III version previously
 installed.
   
 This patch contains the following items:
  
 1. The option would quit prematurely after the user entered an up-arrow to
 exit a previous attempt to generate the report.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The variable QFLG used to denote the user's attempt to quit the option was
 left defined following the aborted report attempt.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSJPDV was updated to NEW the variable QFLG.
  
 2. To generate a report for all drugs within a parent drug class required 
 entry of each child class when specifying the report parameters.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There was no cross-reference in the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605) to
 determine the relationship between parent drug classes and 
 child drug classes.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Patch PSN*4*193 introduces the necessary cross-reference, which is 
 utilized by this patch to allow a user to enter a parent drug class.  The 
 system will then select all of the drugs in the hierarchy of that parent 
 class.
  
 3.  The default response for the Number of Matches prompt did not 
 reflect the most common answer to that question.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Current functionality would count the number of unique entries selected 
 by the user and present that number as a default response to the Number 
 of Matches prompt.  This assumed that a patient had to have all of the 
 selected drugs in their profile in order to be listed in the final report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The default is changed to 1, reflecting a report in which the patient can 
 be on any of the selected drugs in order to be listed on the report.  The 
 user can still enter a higher number to employ the previously defaulted 
 functionality.
  
 4.  The existing program did not include functionality to support the 
 reporting needs of integrated or multidivisional facilities.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The report parameters do not ask for limitation of the output to 
 specified divisions, wards, or ward groups.  The resulting list always 
 included all patients meeting the criteria across an entire VistA 
 database.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A prompt is added to allow the user to select the DIVISION(s)
 from which patients will be reported.  Sites that have only 1 division
 associated with all of their inpatient wards will not see this new prompt.
  
 A prompt is added to allow the user to select the WARDS(s) from which
 patients will be reported.
  
 If no selection is made for the division or ward prompt, the user will 
 be allowed to select one WARD GROUP from which patients will be reported.
