Subject: CORRECT MAR HEADER FOR DIET INFO

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD0000000193031 - Incorrect diet information on MAR header
 2. HD0000000169943 - Clinic Group not showing up on Non Verified/Pending 
                      report
 3. HD0000000258201 - 6 IV REPORT DIFFERENT FOR LOWER CASE
 4. HD0000000225877 - IV duration on CPRS order not calculated correctly as 
                      stop date
  
 OVERVIEW OF REMEDY TICKETS:
 ==========================
 1. HD0000000193031 - Diet information not updated on MAR
  
 Problem
 ----------------------------
 When a Medication Administration Record (MAR) report is run and contains
 patients with different diet information, only the diet information found 
 on the first patient is displayed for the rest of the patients. The diet
 information on the header of the MAR for each patient never gets updated 
 which could show wrong diet information for a patient.
  
 Resolution
 ----------------------------
 The diet information for each patient should be one of the fields stored 
 in the patient node (X).  This node is set in one of the ^TMP sort globals
 for each patient. User can sort by GROUP (G), WARD (W), CLINIC (C), or
 PATIENT (P). Currently the diet information is set only one time. When any
 diet information
 is found on a patient, the same value is repeated for all patients that 
 have diet information defined for them.  This results in incorrect diet
 information being printed on the MAR for all patients after the first
 patient in the sort.
  
 ----------------------------
  
  
 2. HD0000000169943 - Summary Order totals may not show for all clinic groups 
                      that have multiple clinics tied to them.
  
 Problem
 ---------------------------
 The order summary of the NON-Verified/Pending Orders report does not 
 display order totals for all clinics associated with clinic groups. The
 report only shows the first group based on the sort. The report should
 print all orders on all the clinic groups to which a clinic belongs.  
 Clinic totals are only displayed on the first clinic group in the sort
 that the clinic is associated with.
  
 Resolution
 ---------------------------
 The report was modified to return an array of all clinic groups a clinic 
 belongs to and then display the order totals under each of the clinic 
 groups. This may cause order count total to be off, but will help
 alleviate the chance of user missing a clinic group. A note was added to
 the clinic group header making the user aware that the order totals for
 clinic groups may not reflect the actual order total count.
  
  
 3. HD0000000258201 - 6 IV REPORT DIFFERENT FOR LOWER CASE
  
 Problem
 ----------------------------
 When the Drug Cost Report [PSJI DRUG COST REPORT] is run after selecting
 a lower case "c", the regular version of the report is printed instead of
 condensed version.
  
 Resolution
 ----------------------------
 The report was modified to print a condensed report if a lower case "c" is
 selected during the print sequence.
  
  
 4. HD0000000225877 - IV duration on CPRS order not calculated correctly as 
                      stop date
  
 Problem
 ----------------------------
 An IV Fluid order placed in CPRS with defined day limit of 3 days is not 
 showing the correct IV order stop date in IV finish process.
 
 The default Stop Date/Time for orders is the date and time the order will 
 automatically expire.  The default date shown is the least of (1) the 
 <IV TYPE> GOOD FOR HOW MANY DAYS site parameter (where <IV TYPE> is 
 LVPs, PBs, etc.), (2) the NUMBER OF DAYS FOR IV ORDER field (found in the 
 IV ADDITIVES file) for all additives in this order, (3) the DAY (nD) or 
 DOSE (nL) LIMIT field (found in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file) for the 
 orderable item associated with this order or (4) the duration received from 
 CPRS (if applicable).
 
 The problem was that the Inpatient Medications Nurse's and Pharmacist's User 
 Manual indicate that a provider-entered duration will override pharmacy site 
 parameters.  This is not the case based on the rules stated above.
 The providers believed they could override the parameter generated duration 
 based on the documentation.  Therefore medications could be administered for 
 a shorter duration than expected by the provider.
  
 Resolution
 ----------------------------
 The definition of IV Duration in the Inpatient Medications Nurse's and 
 Pharmacist's User Manuals has been changed to remove the documentation 
 dealing with the duration overriding the pharmacy site parameters.

      the first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
        Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
