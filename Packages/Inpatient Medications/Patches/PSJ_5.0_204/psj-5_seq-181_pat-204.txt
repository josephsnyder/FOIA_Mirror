 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000228442 - With order placed on HOLD, patient was discharged then 
 auto-reinstated without status of HOLD
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An order for Metformin was written on Friday for a certain patient. The 
 patient had a CT scan on the same day and the Physician put the medication 
 on HOLD. The intention was to have the order on HOLD for 48 hours, since 
 the medication can cause problems with renal failure in conjunction with 
 the CT procedure.
    
 The next day the patient was discharged from observation and then 
 immediately admitted to a regular ward.  This action reinstated the 
 medication and from this time forward the medication was administered for 
 the rest of the weekend. The medication was administered via BCMA GUI, as 
 if there were no HOLD on it.
    
 After the weekend, when the Physician went to UNHOLD the medication, it
 was discovered that it was NOT in a HOLD status as expected.  The 
 medication had been administered over the weekend and had not been in a 
 HOLD status because of the discharge and immediate auto-reinstatement.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The logic in ENR^PSJOERI was modified to check that the 
 HOLD FLAG field (#56) on the UNIT DOSE subfile (#55.06) or the 
 HOLD FLAG field (#149) of the IV subfile (#55.01) of the 
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is set to "1" on the order. If the 
 HOLD FLAG field for the order is set to "1", the status will be 
 reset to "H" for Hold instead of "A" for Active as it currently does.
