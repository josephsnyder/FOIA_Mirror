Subject: PADE CLINIC WILDCARD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issues.
  
 1. INC6952934 - PADE inbound setting under dispensing device wildcard 
                 clinic name is not displaying PADE status inpatient order
                 entry as it should be.
  
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC6952934 - PADE inbound setting under dispensing device wildcard 
                 clinic name is not displaying PADE status inpatient order
                 entry as it should be.
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center reported that Pharmacy Automated
 Dispensing Equipment (PADE) settings (inbound transactions) are not
 linking up to appropriate clinic locations when the wildcard clinic name
 field is used (this link works for all other location fields in the PADE
 dispensing device).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change was made to routine PSJPAD50 and PSJPADSI to correct the wildcard
 search. It will not quit the loop if the first entry does not match the
 clinic of the order to be finished using the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ
 OE] option. This fix result in displaying the PADE data during the
 verification process.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Cleveland VAMC
 Albany VAMC
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
     (ex. PSJ*5*392):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to back-out this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if back-out of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.  
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//', respond 0.
  
  
 Installation Verification 
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;16 DEC 97;[BUILD NUMBER] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.  
  
 Back-out Procedures 
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.  
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Validation of Back Out Procedure 
 ---------------------------------
 The Back Out Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSJ*5*392 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSJ*5*392 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
