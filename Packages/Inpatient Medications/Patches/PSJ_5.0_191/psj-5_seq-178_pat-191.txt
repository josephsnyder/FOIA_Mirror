 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD131825
  
    Problem
    -------
    When the user prints out an Update Pick List [PSJU PLUP] after an order
    with multiple dispense drugs is renewed, the calculation of units
    needed is displayed incorrectly.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    In the routine PSGPLR, there is a variable called PSJRNW which needs 
    to be set up as an array to handle the calculation for each of the
    multiple dispensed drugs.
  
  
 2. HD189032
  
    Problem 
    ------- 
    A user received an <UNDEFINED> error trying to run the Medications Due 
    Worksheet [PSJ MDWS] on a pending order that had been nurse verified.
  
    Resolution 
    ----------
    Modified the logic in routine PSJMPEND to handle variables set in the
    ^TMP global which hadn't been set yet.
  
  
 3. HD189597
  
    Problem
    -------
    A site received an error when attempting to use menu option Complete
    Orders (IV) [PSJI COMPLETE].
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    In the patch build, set the menu option to "DELETE AT SITE".  
    This menu option is a stand-alone or orphaned option, so no menu trees 
    need to be rebuilt.
