Subject: PHARMACY CHANGES TO SUPPORT CPRS GUI V27

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Informational
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains changes in support of Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS) GUI v27 release.
  
 CPRS GUI v27 consists of two host files: OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID and
 CPRS_BUNDLE_GUI_27_REQ_REL.KID.
 These two host files contain software patches that support CPRS GUI v27
 functionality. The host files were created to simplify installation at
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Please refer to the
 "CPRS GUI v.27 and Associated Patches Installation Guide" for installation
 sequence information. This document is exported as OR_30_243IG.doc and
 OR_30_243IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_243.ZIP.
  
 No additional installation or set-up steps specific to Inpatient
 Medications are required once the software is installed.
  
 1.  MEDICATION ROUTE CHANGES (PSI-07-036)
 -----------------------------------------
 - Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 will use the medication route received from
   CPRS  as the default when finishing an IV order entered via CPRS.
   For new orders entered via Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, if all
   of the orderable items associated with an order contain the same default
   medication route, that route will be used as the default. If there are
   any differences, there will be no default medication route.
  
 - Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 will send to BCMA V. 3.0 the full
   medication route name for display on the Virtual Due List (VDL).
   This addresses PSI-07-036 (Remedy Ticket HD178478).
  
 2.  INFUSION RATE CHANGES
 -------------------------
 - Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 now accepts infusion rate from CPRS in both
   ml/hour and as 'infuse over time'.
  
 - In the order view screen for an order with an intermittent IV type, the
   infusion rate now displays as "Infuse Over" followed by the time. For
   example, "Infuse Over 30 minutes".
  
   The infusion rate for an intermittent IV order can be null.
  
 3.  IV TYPE CHANGES
 -------------------
 - Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 shall accept an IV type of "I"
   (Intermittent) or "C" (Continuous) from CPRS.  When an IV type of
   CONTINUOUS is received, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 defaults to an IV
   type of Admixture.  When IV type of INTERMITTENT is received, 
   Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 defaults to an IV type of Piggyback.
   Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 sends to CPRS  updates to an order's
   IV type.
  
 - Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 now accepts schedule information from
   CPRS  for intermittent IV orders entered via the IV Fluid
   Ordering Dialog.  Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 also sends to
   CPRS  any schedule changes for intermittent IV orders.
  
 - A new field, IV TYPE CATEGORY (#128) is being added to the NON-
   VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).  The IV TYPE CATEGORY will be "C"
   (Continuous) for orders with an IV TYPE of Admixture, Hyperal,
   Non-Intermittent Syringe, or Chemotherapy with a CHEMOTHERAPY TYPE
   of Admixture, Hyperal, or Non-Intermittent Syringe.  The IV TYPE
   CATEGORY will be "I" (Intermittent) for orders with an IV TYPE of
   Piggyback, Intermittent Syringe, or Chemotherapy with a CHEMOTHERAPY
   TYPE of Piggyback or Intermittent Syringe.
  
 4.  RENEWED ORDER CHANGES (PSI-06-023, PSI-05-006)
 --------------------------------------------------
 - When discontinuing pending renewal orders, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0
   will provide the user an option to discontinue the pending renewal
   order and/or the original orders.  The pharmacist shall be given the
   option to discontinue the pending order, both orders, or exit the
   discontinue function.  This addresses PSI-06-023 (Remedy Ticket HD132020)
   and PSI-05-006 (Remedy Ticket HD71193).
  
 5.  REMOVE CALLS TO OBSOLETE ROUTINE
 ------------------------------------
 - At the request of CPRS, active calls to obsolete routine OR3CONV
   have been removed from Inpatient Medications V. 5.0. 
  
 6.  EXPECTED FIRST DOSE FOR ONE-TIME ORDERS (HD 98365)
 ------------------------------------------------------
 Problem:
    During testing of the CPRS  GUI v26 release, sites reported a
    problem with an incorrect display of expected first dose for orders
    with a schedule type of "ONE TIME".
 Resolution:
    If the schedule type is "ONE TIME", do not display an Expected
    First Dose for the order.  This addresses Remedy Ticket HD98365.
  
 7.  CORRECT ABBREVIATION OF MILLIMOLE (HD 145562)
 -------------------------------------------------
 Problem:
    The correct abbreviation for the word MILLIMOLE, which is MMOL
    is not available in the system.
 Resolution:
    The abbreviation for Millimole, "MMOL", will be included in
    this patch.  This addresses Remedy Ticket HD145562.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from
    download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from
    the first available FTP server.
  
 2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
    specific server as follows:
  
    Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
    Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
    Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 3. Documentation can also be retrieved from VISTA Documentation Library
    (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, http://www.va.gov/vdl.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  Please refer to patch OR*3*243 for the complete installation
  instructions.  This patch is not intended to be installed as a
  stand-alone patch.
  
  CPRS GUI v27 consists of three patches. The patches are combined 
  in host file OR_PSJ_PSO_27.KID in order to simplify installation at
  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Installation of this
  file should be coordinated among the three packages affected since only
  one installation is necessary. The patches are:
  
    PSJ*5*134    INPATIENT MEDICATIONS
    PSO*7*225    OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS
    OR*3*243     ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
