 Problem:
 --------------------------
 Unit Dose medication orders entered with a schedule of ONE TIME PRN were 
 not automatically discontinued after being given in Bar Code Medication 
 Administration (BCMA) Version 3.0. As a result, the medication was given 
 multiple times, despite the ordering provider's intent to allow only one 
 optional dose. In the reported scenario, ONE TIME is the name of a schedule 
 defined in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) with a type of One Time.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------------------- 
 Based on workgroup feedback, the issue will be addressed by treating any
 order containing a One Time schedule (i.e., a schedule defined in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) with a type of One Time) as an order
 that is to be given only once, regardless of the order's Schedule Type.
 An exception will be ON CALL schedules which will not necessarily be 
 automatically expired after being given once.
  
 Orders containing schedules in the form "base schedule PRN" will also be
 considered One Time orders if the base schedule is defined in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) as a One Time schedule type. The 
 "base schedule PRN" format is used when the PRN check box is checked 
 during order entry, from the ordering dialog in Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS). The PRN may also be appended to the schedule name 
 manually from Inpatient Medications Version 5.0 order entry options.
  
 For the purposes of these changes, an order is treated as a One Time 
 order when, after it is documented in BCMA as Given, the order may not be 
 documented as Given a second time, and the order is automatically expired 
 immediately upon being documented as Given in BCMA.
