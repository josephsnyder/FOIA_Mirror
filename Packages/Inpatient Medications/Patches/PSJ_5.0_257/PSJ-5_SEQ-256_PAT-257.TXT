Description:
============

 ****************************  Please Note   *****************************
 There is a typographical error for the patch number seen during the 
 install process where the user will see:
  
 Queuing background job for PSJ*5*297 Post Install...
  
 The messaging should show patch PSJ*5*257 instead of PSJ*5*297. Although 
 patch name PSJ*5*297 appears, the correct background job is queued.
  
 There is also a typographical error for the patch number in the subject 
 line of the message the installing person gets when the background job 
 completes:
  
 Subj: Background job for PSJ*5*297 Post Install  [#179515] 07/01/13@14:17 
 7 lines
  
 The Subject of the email should show patch PSJ*5*257 instead of 
 PSJ*5*297. The message is otherwise correct.
 *************************************************************************
  
  
 This patch is part of a group of host file patches that make up the new
 Medication Order Check Healthcare Application v2.0 (MOCHA). These patches
 contain software that supports MOCHA v2.0 functionality.  The host files
 were created to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration
 (VHA) facilities. 
  
 Patch Information:
 ------------------
 The following patches will be distributed in a phased release and sites 
 will be given access to the host files during their scheduled phase of
 implementation:
  
   1. PSS_1_160.KID
   2. PSS_1_173.KID
   3. MOCHA_2_0.KID contains: PSO*7*372, PSJ*5*252, and OR*3*345
   4. MOCHA_2_0_FOLLOW_UP_COMBINED_BUILD.KID contains: PSO*7*416,
         PSJ*5*257, GMRA*4*47, and OR*3*311
   5. OR_3_381.KID
   6. MOCHA_2_0_FAST_TRACK_BUILDS.KID contains: PSO*7*431, PSJ*5*299

 M2_Deploy_Trng/SitePages/Home.aspx
  
 **NOTE**
 When this patch is installed in step 4 of the MOCHA v2.0 installation 
 process, the 'before' checksum of routine ORCMED will be incorrect, as 
 will the second line of that routine because it will not include patch 
 OR*3*380. The functionality introduced with patch OR*3*380 is overwritten 
 by this patch. However, when patch OR*3*381 is installed in step 5 of the 
 MOCHA v2.0 installation process, that will correct the second line of 
 routine ORCMED and restore the functionality from patch OR*3*380.
  
 PSS_1_160 and PSS_1_173 include the components necessary for the
 interface that will be used in MOCHA v2.0.  The MOCHA 2.0 and 
 MOCHA 2.0 FOLLOW UP COMBINED BUILD include the modifications to implement
 Max Single Dose Order checks for the Order Entry Results Reporting (OERR),
 Inpatient Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy applications.
  
 These patches will add a maximum single dose order check to the current
 VistA medication order checking system that uses the First DataBank (FDB)
 business logic and database. In this initial phase of dosing
 functionality, the Maximum Single Dose information will be displayed to
 the user.  The following scenarios describe the types of messaging added:
  
   1. If the dosage entered passes the dosing checks, no message will be
      displayed.
  
   2. If the dosage entered is too high, the Single Dose warning
      message will be displayed.
  
   3. If the dose checks were not able to be performed, a generic message
      will be displayed notifying the user that a manual check needs to be
      completed to verify appropriate dosing.
  
 **************************************************************************
 When using the option Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD 
 COMPARE TO SYSTEM] with the host file MOCHA_2_0_FOLLOW_UP_COMBINED_BUILD 
 you will see the following warnings on certain routines:
  
 Host file: MOCHA_2_0_FOLLOW_UP_COMBINED_BUILD.KID contains: PSO*7*416, 
 PSJ*5*257, GMRA*4*47, and OR*3*311
  
 PSJ*5*257:
  
 Routine:  PSIVORFB
 *** WARNING, your routine has different patches than the incoming routine 
 ***
  
 Routine:  PSJBLDOC, PSJGMRA, PSJOC, PSJOCDI, PSJOEA2
 *** WARNING, you are missing one or more Patches ***
  
 These warnings are due to the sequence of released patches prior to MOCHA 
 v2.0. Once all the MOCHA v2.0 patches are installed, the second lines of
 the routines will be updated appropriately.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 The following issues are also addressed by this patch:
  
 1. When processing orders for multiple patients using the 
 Non-Verified/Pending Orders option, the patients list was reset and 
 the previous patient's profile was redisplayed to the user.  This patch
 will correct this issue.  CCR 6088.
  
 2. Whenever a single dose amount for an IV order needed to be adjusted, 
 only under certain circumstance was a note displayed to inform the
 user the dose had been adjusted.  This change will always display a note
 to let the users know if the single dose amount has been adjusted.  CCR
 6173.
  
 3. If there were multiple Unit Dose/IV orders on the profile that had 
 drug exceptions, the warning was only displayed for the first order of
 the group.  This issue existed in Inpatient backdoor only.  CCR 6223.
  
 4. This patch will update the 2nd commented line of the PSJOEA2 routine 
 to reflect the correct patching order.  No functionality is impacted.  
 CCR 6311.
  
 5.  To alleviate alert fatigue for those sites using clinics in their 
 everyday process, a modification has been made to add a new parameter
 IMO DC/EXPIRED DAY LIMIT field (#6) to CLINIC DEFINITION file (#53.46).
  
 This field contains the number of days that DC/Expired orders will be
 included in the enhanced order checks for drug interaction and therapeutic
 duplications for clinic orders. If this field is left blank, a default
 value of 30 days will be used. Sites can define this field to be from 1
 day up to 120 days for displaying clinic enhanced order checks.
  
 In addition, the CLINIC DEFINITION [PSJ CD] option has been updated to 
 allow enter/edit for the IMO DC/EXPIRED DAY LIMIT field (#6).
  
 Based on the number of days defined in the IMO DC/EXPIRED DAY LIMIT field 
 (#6), the enhanced order checks process will only display discontinued and
 expired drug interactions and/or duplicate therapy clinic orders that fall
 within the range defined.

 This group of patches will be part of a phased implementation and sites
 will be given access to the MOCHA V2.0 INSTALLATION GUIDE and patches
 during their phase of implementation.  Note the following typographical 
 errors in the install guide:
  
 ****************************  Please Note   *****************************
 There is a typographical error for the patch number seen during the 
 install process where the user will see:

 The messaging should show patch PSJ*5*257 instead of PSJ*5*297. Although 
 patch name PSJ*5*297 appears, the correct background job is queued.
  
 There is also a typographical error for the patch number in the subject
