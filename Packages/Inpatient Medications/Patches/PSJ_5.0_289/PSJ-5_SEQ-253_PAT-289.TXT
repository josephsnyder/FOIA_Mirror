Subject: ADDING STRENGTH FIELD TO IV ADDITIVES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch must be installed after patch PSS*1.0*174.
  
 Patch PSS*1.0*174 introduced a new field into the IV ADDITIVES File 
 (#52.6). The new field, STRENGTH (#19) represents the numeric value of 
 one unit-of-use for the medication.
  
 The current functionality in backdoor pharmacy that displays an IV
 order where multiple IV additives for varying dosage strengths are tied to
 an orderable item is misleading. Adding the new strength field (introduced
 by patch PSS*1*174) as part of the additive display will help in 
 identifying the correct additive.
  
 1) When a pharmacist is entering an IV order using the backdoor options
 Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] or Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER] the change
 to add the Strength (#19) field to the IV Additives file (#52.6) can be 
 seen.
  
  For example:
  
 Select IV TYPE: PIGGYBACK.
 Select ADDITIVE: CEFAZOL
      1   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1 GM  
                IV ROOM ONLY
      2   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 2 GM  
                
      3   CEFAZOLIN PREMIX         Additive Strength: N/A  
                
 CHOOSE 1-3:
  
 2) When a pharmacist is entering an IV order using the backdoor options
 Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] or Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER] this patch
 makes a small enhancement to the display of Quick Codes during the
 selection of an IV ADDITIVE. If there are QUICK CODES defined for the IV
 ADDITIVE, the STRENGTH (#1) and USUAL IV SCHEDULE (#4) fields from the
 QUICK CODE Subfile (#52.61) will display next to the QUICK CODE. If the
 fields are not defined for the QUICK CODE, "N/A" will be displayed.
  
 For example:
 Select IV TYPE: PIGGYBACK.
 Select ADDITIVE: CEF
      1   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1 GM  
                VISN
        - KEF1Q8 -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: Q8H
        - KEF1Q6 -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: Q6H
        - KEF2Q8 -        Quick Code Strength: 2 GM     Schedule: Q8H
        - KEF2Q6 -        Quick Code Strength: 2 GM     Schedule: Q6H
        - KEF1Q8S -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: Q8H
        - KEF1Q6S -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: Q6H
        - KEF2Q8S -        Quick Code Strength: 2 GM     Schedule: Q8H
        - KEF2Q6S -        Quick Code Strength: 2 GM     Schedule: Q12H
        - CFZ28 -        Quick Code Strength: 2 GM     Schedule: Q8H
        - CF1D550 -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: N/A
      2   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1.5 GM  
                VISN
  
 3) When viewing an order in Inpatient Medications, there is a hidden
 action called "DIN", or "Drug Restrictions/Guidelines". With this patch,
 when DIN is called on an IV order, the IV Additive strength will be
 displayed along with the Drug Unit. If the IV Additive Strength is not
 populated, the text "N/A" will appear instead.
  
 For example (STRENGTH populated):
  
 Drug restriction/guideline info:
  
 IV Additive: CEFAZOLIN   Additive Strength: 1 GM
  
  
    Orderable Item: CEFAZOLIN INJ
  
           No information available
  
    Dispense drug: CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ
  
           No information available
  
  
 For example (STRENGTH not populated):
  
 IV Additive: CEFAZOLIN PREMIX   Additive Strength: N/A
  
  
    Orderable Item: CEFAZOLIN INJ
  
           No information available
  
    Dispense drug: CEFAZOLIN SOD 1GM INJ *N/F*
  
           No information available
