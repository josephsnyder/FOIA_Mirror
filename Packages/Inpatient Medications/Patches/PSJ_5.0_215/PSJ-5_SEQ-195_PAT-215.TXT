Subject: Y09-Q2 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains a partial resolution for Patient Safety Issue
 PSI 07-073, PSPO #526, and is outlined in Remedy Ticket #67749.
 Another portion of this PSI is being addressed by the Vista Maintenance
 Team in a separate patch, PSJ*5.0*216.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the pharmacist edits the dispense drug(s) for an active unit dose
 order, there is currently no entry made in the activity log for the
 order that reflects this change.  Medication errors have happened due to
 edited dispense drugs, and there is currently no audit trail to help track
 the information.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This enhancement will compare the original dispense drug(s) for the order
 with the edited value for the dispense drug(s). If there is a difference
 between the values, the modified code in routine PSGOE92 will call the
 routine that logs entries into the activity log for the order.
  
 The structure for the activity log entry:
 DATE^DUZ^6000^FIELD^OLD
  
 DATE  =  Timestamp date/time of the edit.
 DUZ   =  The IEN of the person making the edit.
 6000  =  A code denoting that a field was edited.
 FIELD =  The name of the field that was edited.
 OLD   =  Old data before the field was edited. This contains the
          dispense drug IEN, dispense drug name, and units per dose.
