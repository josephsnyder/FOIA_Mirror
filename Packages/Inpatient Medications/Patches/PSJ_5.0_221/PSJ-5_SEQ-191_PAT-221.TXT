Description:
============

  The patch will re-enable the PSJU LM SPEED FINISH and PSJU LM SPEED

  Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
  =============================
 
  1. HD0000000297810 - PSPO# 1221 - Orders did not show in BCMA.
  
  Problem:
  --------
  If a patient has multiple pending renewals and pending orders, it was 
  possible to use the SPEED FINISH (SF) and SPEED VERIFY (SV) options to 
  finish the pending renewals, as well as finish the pending orders. 
  When performing these functions, the frequency and start date from the 
  pending renewal orders have been copied over into the pending orders. 
  These orders would then be finished with a corrupt start date and 
  frequency. These corrupt orders would display incorrect administration 
  times on the virtual due list (VDL) in BCMA.  In this case, doses did not
  appear on the VDL that should have.  The patient then would receive 
  medication at an unintended frequency causing an under dosing of the patient.
  
 
  2. HD0000000302185 - PSPO# 1274 - 1 Possible patient safety issue with med 
                                    order
 
  Problem:
  --------
  A Patient had a standing order for a medication with a schedule of every 
  28 days.  The medication was renewed and SPEED FINISH (SF) and SPEED VERIFY 
  (SV) options were used to finish the pending renewal.  At this point the 
  frequency for the order changed from 40320 (28 days) to 1440 (24 hours).
  The resulting problem was that the order appeared on the BCMA VDL every day 
  and the medication was administered 3 days in a row thus overdosing the
  patient.   
 
  3. HD0000000302727 - PSPO# 1278 - 1 Bar Code Med Admin issue - Admin Times
 
  Problem:
  --------
  A patient had 3 medication orders for DAILY (once a day) medications. 
  When viewing these orders in Inpatient Medications, the site discovered that 
  they had no Administration time. When viewed in BCMA GUI they discovered 
  that they were showing up to be given every 6 hours instead of once daily. 
  Before this was discovered, the patient received 4 times the ordered dosage 
  of these 3 medication orders, for a period of 10 days.  The corrupt
  frequency was caused by using the SPEED FINISH (SF) and SPEED VERIFY (SV) 
  options to finish pending renewals.
 
 
  Resolution:
  ----------- 
  The protocols PSJU LM SPEED FINISH and PSJU LM SPEED VERIFY will be 
  re-enabled. The resolution for this issue is to correct the selection
  criteria for the use of SPEED FINISH and SPEED VERIFY. Previously the
  selection criteria was not taking the PENDING orders into account and
  would let the user select pending orders when the option should only be
  used for pending renewals.
  
  Technical:
  ----------
  The routine PSGOESF was modified to count the number of pending orders 
  being displayed and account for those pending orders being below the 
  pending renewals. This requires the user to select only pending
  renewals for Speed Finish.  Speed Verify will only verify renewals at
  a Non-Verified status.
  
  During installation, a report can be queued in the background to send 
  a summary of problem orders to the current user and users holding the 
  "PSJ RPHARM" key. This report will only search for active, continuous, 
  unit dose orders. The report can also be run again after the patch 
  installation by running EN^PSJSFRQ from the programmer prompt. Medications
  with frequency mismatches should be discontinued immediately.

  * will be queued in the background and send a summary of     *
  * problem orders to the current user and users holding the   *
  * "PSJ RPHARM" key. This report will only search for active, *
  * continuous, unit dose orders.                              *
