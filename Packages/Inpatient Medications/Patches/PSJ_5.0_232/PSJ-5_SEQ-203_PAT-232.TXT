 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
  
 1. HD0000000345272 - PSPO #00001500 IVP syringe not appearing on menu option 
    Action Profile #2 [PSJU AP-2] report with the rest of expiring orders.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The reporting site uses the menu option Action Profile #2 report for providers
 to renew orders for patients.  There is logic in the report to screen out the
 IV syringe orders with an IVP med route.  IV syringe orders with an IVP med 
 route should be counted in the medication type of 3 IVPB which includes IV 
 syringe orders with a med route of IV or IVPB.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Added the logic to include syringe orders with an IVP med route in the menu 
 option Action Profile #2 report.
  
 2. HD0000000338914 - Lab QO stuck in infinite loop.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 For Lab Quick Orders, if frequency is not defined for a schedule such as for
 day of the week schedules, the calculation of the schedule becomes hung in 
 a loop causing the user to be unable to exit the screen.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Because frequency is not a required field for day of the week schedules, 
 logic was added in the schedule calculation to not perform the calculation 
 if the frequency is not defined and the screen will therefore not become 
 hung.
  
  
 3. HD0000000345434 - Documentation changes needed.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In option Action Profile #1 [PSJU AP-1], start and stop dates are not 
 prompted, but the PHARMACIST'S USER MANUAL stated that start and stop 
 dates are prompted after selecting ward group, ward, or patient.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 In the PHARMACIST'S USER MANUAL, the second paragraph was removed under 
 section 8.1.2.4 Action Profile #1 [PSJU AP-1]
 
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 The revised PHARMACIST'S USER MANUAL is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
 directory at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. 
 These files should be retrieved in binary format.
     
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from 
      the first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
        Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
      The documentation distribution includes:
  
      File Name                  Description
